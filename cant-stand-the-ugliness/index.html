<div class="entry-content"><p>People enjoy their modern lives where things are the way that they are.  They have always been that way.  Changes disrupt that happy life.  Even trying to dig beyond the surface reveals things that they are loathe to consider.</p>

<p>Take meat for example.  While there are vegans who abolish all animal products from their life, there are still a great number of people that do not.  They are happy to go to a chop house and order a nice big steak.  Many people that I know would opt for a simmering and perfectly cooked as a last meal.  How many of them would be shocked to see the cow butchered to produce said steak?  I know that it would be quite a sight to behold myself.  But many people who would eat a well-cooked steak in a heartbeat would turn away equally fast from seeing how that steak came to be.  And yet, that is all part of the process.  It is no less true than the steak that sits in front of them in a fancy restaurant.</p>

<p>Moving a step in the more offensive category, what about abortion?  Depending on whose statistics you believe, there is probably about half of the population that thinks that abortion is just fine and dandy.  And how many of those people do you think would be willing to see what actually happens during an abortion?  Just ask groups like <a href="http://www.survivors.la/">Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust</a>, a Christian pro-life activism group that aims to educate high school and college students, about what they encounter when they go out.  With their huge graphic displays, they offend people because it brings to light things that they don&#8217;t want to see.  I have read articles about them getting into heated shouting matches and even getting arrested.  Arrested for free speech?!  In our enlightened society?!</p>

<p>People who are pro-abortion like to think of themselves as pro-choice.  They&#8217;re about the ability to choose something.  That&#8217;s freedom!  But when things start to ge a little more real than that, I am sure that they will be some of the first to avert their eyes.  They will get heated because they will have to face the reality, which is ugly to them.</p>

<p>People love their nice packaged lives.  They enjoy that everything is so nice and prepared for them.  Abstractions are so much easier than the real thing.  Get a grip people, there&#8217;s definitely more to things than what you want.</p>
