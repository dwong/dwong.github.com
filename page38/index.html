  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I just finished traveling for work.  It was quite an interesting experience.  First of all, I&rsquo;ve not traveled for work before.  Secondly, it was supremely interesting getting to watch this whole slew of people that I would not normally get to watch.</p>

<p>People watching was probably one of the more interesting things that I got to do.</p>

<h5>Why do we like to watch people?</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m of the mind that we (well at least I) like to watch people because we are interested in the human experience.  Well that and because very often it&rsquo;s pretty amusing.  Or perhaps at the very heart of the matter, we like to see how we stack up against everyone else that&rsquo;s around.  Sometimes they&rsquo;re stranger, sometimes they&rsquo;re scarier, and sometimes they&rsquo;re just like us.  Alright they&rsquo;re never just like us.  We wouldn&rsquo;t ever want to admit as much anyways.</p>

<p>People are interesting.  Even the boring ones.  Because the boring ones are very interesting when they don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re being watched.</p>

<h5>Benefits of people watching</h5>

<ol>
<li><h6>Laughter</h6></li>
</ol>


<p>You gotta hand it to people, they&rsquo;ll do some ridiculously hilarious things when they&rsquo;re unaware that they&rsquo;re being watched</p>

<ol>
<li><h6>Entertainment</h6></li>
</ol>


<p>Just because you forgot your electronic device or book, you&rsquo;ll still have something to do.  Almost no matter where are (unless you live as a hermit in which case this post is not for you).</p>

<ol>
<li><h6>Learn</h6></li>
</ol>


<p>Other people have had different experiences in their lives.  Perhaps watching them will teach you lessons about how you can be a better person.</p>

<ol>
<li><h6>Smile</h6></li>
</ol>


<p>Catch those &ldquo;cute&rdquo; moments that nobody was supposed to see.  You know, that darling thing that a child did or that self-sacrificing act that someone does for another.  It&rsquo;ll brighten your day and maybe next time you&rsquo;ll be the one who puts a smile on somebody else&rsquo;s slightly-creepy-people-watching face. :)</p>

<ol>
<li><h6>Help</h6></li>
</ol>


<p>If you&rsquo;re not aware or watching, someone could need your help and you would have never known.  If you&rsquo;re people watching, you&rsquo;re (by definition) aware of your surroundings.  So that makes it easier if you see someone getting hurt or in need of your assistence because you&rsquo;ll see the need and lend a hand, won&rsquo;t you?  Let&rsquo;s hope so!</p>

<p>People watching is a great thing to do.  And it&rsquo;s even more fun to do when you are surrounded by people that you would not normally be around (as I was this past weekend for my work conference).  I didn&rsquo;t know the vast majority of them, but I still enjoyed getting to watch them.  I got to see how they interacted, I got to laugh at humorous things that I saw, and I got to amuse myself even  (hopefully nobody really noticed me doing so).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Commenting is a fun part of going around to different blogs.  One thing that I&rsquo;ve found is that it&rsquo;s easy to respond to comments left on my own blog because I have a central place to access them from (namely my WordPress administration panel).  It allows me to easily have conversations with people that stop by and leave comments.</p>

<h5>Leaving Comments On Other Blogs</h5>

<p>However I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s not quite as to do with comments that I&rsquo;ve left on other blogs.  The reason for that is because I don&rsquo;t have that central place to access to see all of my comments!  I&rsquo;m not very well going to remember the URL of every post that I leave a comment on.  That would frankly be ridiculous.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found a key to this problem.  I&rsquo;m sure that there are others out there, but I think that this one works decently enough.  Check out <a href="http://co.mments.com">co.mments.com</a> if you want to see what I mean.  In fact, you can even let other people see what you&rsquo;re commenting on so that they can check it out and see if they&rsquo;re interested in the same posts!  Here is <a href="http://co.mments.com/people/goingthewongway">my public co.mments.com page</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So after more time than I&rsquo;d like to admit, I&rsquo;ve finally finished enough of my theme to put it on goingthewongway!  I&rsquo;m excited that I&rsquo;ve changed it.  Check it out and let me know what you think!</p>

<p>And now I present to you: Soi-disant</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only changed my theme once to (Not So) Fresh as I posted in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/09/new-look/">New Look</a>.  That was 8 months ago and since then quite a bit has changed.</p>

<h5>Why I wanted to make my own theme</h5>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h6>Have a unique look to my blog</h6>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come across other blogs that had the same theme, and that wasn&rsquo;t too exciting for me.  I want and like to be my own.  So even though the last one did look nice, it was unfortunate because other people thought that it looked nice as well.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h6>Learn much, much more web design</h6>

<p>CSS in particular, HTML and PHP to a lesser degree since I already knew a fair amount before doing the theme.  Part of who I am wants to understand how things work and why.  So learning new things can be very exciting to me.  Not to mention the fact that it&rsquo;s very pertinent to my profession of computer programming.  (Although I must admit that I believe that I lack the creativity necessary to actually ever become a web designer.  I know the nuts and bolts but lack the vision.  :P)</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h6>Create a fluid display</h6>

<p>I wanted one that would show up well on the very popular 1024x768 and 1280x1024 screen resolutions in addition to any other screen resolutions.  I&rsquo;m sorry to say that it&rsquo;s very likely that anything below 1024x768 won&rsquo;t look all that great.  A fluid display means that the text and page elements will expand according to how much space is available.  My previous theme was fixed width so it didn&rsquo;t look too great to me on higher resolution displays.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h6>Speed things up</h6>

<p>The last theme used a fair amount of images to create all of the nice effects.  And that&rsquo;s nice for people on fast connections (which at this point is a very fair amount of people).  However there still are people on slower connections, and I want my blog to be accessible to them as well, too.</p>

<h5>Soi-disant</h5>

<p>I got the name of this theme (Soi-disant) by looking up a word of the day online.  Lame, huh?  I thought it was cool because it means calling oneself thus, self-styled, or so-called.  Seemed interesting to me so there it is.</p>

<p>So I did it all for this theme: header logo, PHP code, HTML, CSS.  It was a learning experience, that is for sure.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like commenting on blogs, and I also very much enjoy receiving comments.  So I added some new plugins that I thought would facilitate that process.</p>

<p>The plugins that I have added and am now using on this blog are:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://meidell.dk/archives/2006/12/19/brians-threaded-comments-159/">Brian&rsquo;s Threaded Comments</a> which allows for comments to be in threads rather than just as a single list.  This is nice because it can get confusing in the way that I used to just use an &ldquo;@ user&rdquo; type of response.  The only drawback is that I&rsquo;ll probably have to limit the number of levels that nesting will occur because it will make the comments unreadable as they get more and more narrow.</li>
</ol>


<p>This code looks stupid and ugly on my current theme, but I&rsquo;m going to change it very soon so I&rsquo;m still going to post it.  Most people don&rsquo;t care about this, but I figured that I&rsquo;d put it out there if anyone did find it useful and didn&rsquo;t know too much PHP.</p>

<p>So is here is the change so that there will be no &ldquo;Reply to this comment&rdquo; link if the comments for a post are already closed:</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class='reply'&gt;&lt;?php global $user_ID; global $post; if ( get_option("comment_registration") &amp;&amp; !$user_ID )
  echo '&lt;a href="'.get_option('siteurl') .                                                                                                                                                  
  '/wp-login.php?redirect_to=' . get_permalink() .                                                                                                                         
  '"&gt;Log in to Reply';
elseif ('open' == $post-&gt;comment_status) {?&gt;                                      
  &lt;a href='#' onclick='moveAddCommentBelow("div-comment-&lt;?php echo $c-&gt;comment_ID ?&gt;", &lt; ?php echo
  $c-&gt;comment_ID ?&gt;, true); return false;'&gt;Reply to this comment&lt;/a&gt;       
&lt; ?php } ?&gt;                                                                                                                                                              
&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>

<p>I also added code from my original comments.php in my theme file so that if a user is logged in, it will not ask them for their information (name, e-mail, etc).  Although I don&rsquo;t think that there are too many people with accounts on my blog (go for it, it&rsquo;s not so bad) I figured that it was at least a solution that I enjoyed more for my own sake.  However the code change was too much for this so I&rsquo;m not going to post it in this entry.
Other than that it&rsquo;s pretty super!  I like the look, and I hope that others will appreciate it.  And most of all I hope that it fosters more discussion!</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.jamesmckay.net/code/comment-timeout/">Comment Timeout</a> lets me fight another problem on my blog.  And that problem is spam comments.  Hateful, despicable spam comments.  They take at least a little bit of time to go through sometimes when people&rsquo;s comments get caught in moderation.  So I&rsquo;ve decided that since it rather makes sense to close the comments on old posts, I will.  It&rsquo;s not as if people particularly post comments on my old posts anyways.</li>
</ol>


<p>Additionally it has the ability to keep the comments active if the post is deemed &ldquo;active.&rdquo;  The plugin is fairly full-featured with some customizable options such as the timeout period, etc.  Not a bad plugin if I do say so myself.  It was a better option for me than the very basic Close Old Posts plugin written by Matt Mullenweg and listed on the wordress.org site.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think of the new plugins!  Does it make you want to leave more comments?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know what is disconcerting?  When someone is just looking at you.  I&rsquo;ve noticed this while being both the looker and the lookee.  (I just made that word up but I could have actually made that into more proper English.  Sometimes I&rsquo;m just a rebel like that.)</p>

<p>So when you&rsquo;re doing anything, whether that&rsquo;s talking to someone, eating, studying, or anything in between it is quite interesting to suddenly look up and see that someone had been staring at you.  You know that they&rsquo;d been staring since they would not have been making a looking motion just as you&rsquo;re looking.  So if they look away quickly or even if they keep looking, it&rsquo;s bound to make you feel a little bit uncomfortable.</p>

<h4>Why do we dislike getting stared at?</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;d say that it&rsquo;s likely because we, as humans, don&rsquo;t like to be analyzed and have someone witnessing everything that we&rsquo;re doing.  We enjoy having some semblance of privacy and freedom to be who we are without being judged.  That&rsquo;s the deep reason.  Practically, we just don&rsquo;t like being creeped out.  Or other people noticing our flaws.  Like that booger in your nose that you can feel but can&rsquo;t pick because that would just be obviously gross.</p>

<h4>What to do?</h4>

<p>Hard as it might be, I say stare back until they back down.  This sounds like a childish game of chicken, but I still think that it&rsquo;s part of a rather fun solution.</p>

<p>Well I suppose that a logical solution would also be to just be comfortable enough with yourself so that you don&rsquo;t need to feel nervous or uneasy with someone following your every move.  But not everyone is going to be able to get to that point.</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip;well you could also go the route of blatantly asking, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your problem, buster?&rdquo; (or some other suitable term for a girl if it&rsquo;s a she rather than a he).  But that takes some guts.  And if you&rsquo;ve got those guts, you probably don&rsquo;t care a lick what they&rsquo;re staring at because you have more important things to do.</p>

<p>So most of us are just going to suck it up.  And not know what to do.  And hope that whoever is looking at us is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Not a creepy stalker</p></li>
<li><p>Someone who is attractive so that the staring is more of a compliment</p></li>
<li><p>Not laughing at you on the inside</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Yeah I don&rsquo;t have a solution, I wish that I did.  Because then I could utilize it!  If you&rsquo;ve got one, let me know because I&rsquo;m no fan of this myself.</p>
