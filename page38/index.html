  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hard drives consist of many bits, configured in a particular way (of which the explanation is far far beyond the scope of this blog post).  But needless to say we like to view the hard drive as a block of space that we can store things in.  The hard drives each have partitions setup on them, the most common case being a single partition for the operating system and all of the data.</p>

<p>However this is not exactly what a lot of people want.  Sometimes they want different partitions because they want different operating systems on the same computer, but more often it&rsquo;s just because they want some kind of division between their data and their operating system, applications, etc.  For more reasons, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(computing">the purpose of partitioning</a>#Purpose) according to wikipedia.</p>

<p>When you install an operating system for the first time, it has a partitioning tool that allows you to choose how you want to partition your new hard drive.  Well often if you buy your computer retail then they&rsquo;ve already set it up for you.  But <em>if</em> you were to actually go through the entire process yourself, then you&rsquo;d likely partition the hard drive with the operating system installer&rsquo;s tool.</p>

<p>But then, what if your hard drive is currently set up differently than you want?  What do you do once your data is all over your drive?  Well you have a couple of choices.  You can either completely format (and erase) your hard drive and start from scratch.  This is obviously not going to be your first choice if you have data on your hard drive already as that would involve backing up and restoring all of your data.  That seems like a rather long process unless you&rsquo;re having serious errors and really do want to start from scratch (which is sometimes the desired outcome).  So the other option is to use some software to re-partition your hard drive while maintaining your data.</p>

<h4>Norton PartitionMagic Replacement</h4>

<p>Many people know about Norton PartitionMagic in order to do exactly this task.  But after eschewing that (in my mind) expensive software, I would highly encourage everyone to check out the free and open source <a href="http://partedmagic.com/">Parted Magic</a>.  That is what I used!  It&rsquo;s a LiveCD (which means that you download it, burn it on a cd, insert it into your computer, and boot off the CD.  It utilizes the <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/index.php">Gparted</a> application for the partitioning duties.</p>

<p>It was a snap to use when I recently upgrade my <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> installation from Feisty Fawn (7.04) to Gutsy Gibbon (7.10) (don&rsquo;t you love the alliterative names, I know that I do).</p>

<p>In order to use just:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Defrag your hard drive</p></li>
<li><p>Download <a href="http://dw.com.com/redir?edId=3&amp;siteId=4&amp;oId=3000-2094_4-10716910&amp;ontId=2094_4&amp;spi=acdc544bd173f09f9d8c0426e5c554e7&amp;lop=link&amp;tag=tdw_dltext&amp;ltype=dl_dlnow&amp;pid=10716910&amp;mfgId=6292732&amp;merId=6292732&amp;destUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.download.com%2F3001-2094_4-10716910.html%3Fspi%3Dacdc544bd173f09f9d8c0426e5c554e7">the .iso image</a></p></li>
<li><p>Burn to a CD as a disk image</p></li>
<li><p>Insert into computer</p></li>
<li><p>Boot to the CD (you might need to change a BIOS setting or two in order to do this)</p></li>
<li><p>Create, resize, modify your partitions and keep your data intact!</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With Google increasing the size of Gmail to a bit less than 4 GB last week, I got to thinking about them as a company.  They&rsquo;re ubiquitous to anyone in a developed country because they are the de facto standard for search engines as of today.  And they&rsquo;re good at what they do, they&rsquo;re real good.</p>

<p>However they&rsquo;re obviously not all knowledgeable or almighty.  They&rsquo;re not God.  Although I suppose that they could be a god to some.  Anyways, not everything that they do is superior.  But the fact that there is so much <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/28/fanaticism/">Fanaticism</a> about Google that you should get an indication that something is up.  And I&rsquo;m not down with that.  (Ha&hellip;ha&hellip;I guess that I still get amused by things like <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/13/up-or-down-same-difference/">Up Or Down, Same Difference</a>.)</p>

<p>Whatever the case, I know that for me they&rsquo;re taking over more and more of my Internet profile.  They have my e-mail with Gmail, they are starting to get some of my documents with Google Documents, they have a lot of my searching (although as of late I&rsquo;ve been trying to be <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/28/winning-with-blingo/">Winning With Blingo</a> instead of going directly through Google), search all over the place with Google Maps, and I use Google Reader to peruse my RSS feeds.   Update: I forgot about the obvious Google Analytics, Google AdSense, and the now Google-owned FeedBurner that I use for this blog.  That&rsquo;s a lot of Google products if you ask me.</p>

<p>But even more than the fact that Google is being used so often, they scare me for other reasons.  The fact that they are creating portions where you are required to have a Google login (such as collaborating on documents) is understandable but at the same time rather monopolistic-leaning if you ask me.  I&rsquo;d wish that they&rsquo;d allow create methods by which to create opportunities for people without having to create Google logins (easy as that may be).  People need/want/love choice.  And some people choose not to have a Google account.  Arguments that they don&rsquo;t need to use shared collaboration ignore the fact that they might need to.  And then there are even scarier things like <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/31/google-web-history/">Google Web History</a> (where they keep track of everything that you access from their site) and impinge on my personal life while also laying down the path to even scarier types of behavior.</p>

<p>I can see how as they get bigger and try to innovate, they could tread on territory that I&rsquo;d much rather they stayed far away from.  Somethings are more important than having perfectly relevant ads or a computer that can predict what you want to know.</p>

<p>Their well-known unofficial motto is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Be Evil,&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t help but get the feeling that the change of evil increases as corporations do.  And Google is getting to be the big boy on the block.  As big of a proponent as I might be for capitalism at work, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I always need to support the entities involved.  I&rsquo;m keeping my eye on you, Google.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well seeing as how there have been more ants as of late, I&rsquo;ve had a few thoughts that have crossed my mind.  Because ants do that.  They inspire me.</p>

<p>What would life be like without insects?</p>

<p>Well there&rsquo;d be less annoyance because ants wouldn&rsquo;t invade your house.  Then again, who&rsquo;s going to clean up those little bits of food that you&rsquo;ve dropped and are unaware that they&rsquo;re there?</p>

<p>Structures would be more sound because termites wouldn&rsquo;t get to the wood that holds it together.  But then how are you going to justify spending lots of money on rebuilding?</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t get stung by bees, wasps, and more.  However, honey is very good.  And good for you.  And it doesn&rsquo;t expire because of its antibacterial properties &ldquo;as a result of the low water activity causing osmosis, hydrogen peroxide effect, and high acidity&rdquo; (ref. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey">Wikipedia&rsquo;s article about honey</a>).</p>

<p>As you&rsquo;re walking, you won&rsquo;t get attacked by a swarm of gnats that endlessly annoy you.  But then you won&rsquo;t get amusing things like <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=dw-aldsbugs100507&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns">gnats helping the Indians win their game</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, even though there are lots and lots of things that I don&rsquo;t particularly care for about ants.  However, I&rsquo;ve learned from reading <a href="http://amzn.to/NOp6Lw">Foundation and Earth</a> that perhaps making worlds into what they were not intended has many unintended and distasteful consequences.  So let&rsquo;s leave everything as it was intended in its beautiful and wonderful balance.  Even if it can bug us to no end.  Sorry, I had to.  :P</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s not much more annoying in life than those small things that are seemingly insignificant but turn out to be extremely noticeable.  Wonder what the heck I&rsquo;m talking about?</p>

<p>So I burned myself while eating a few days ago.  And now it&rsquo;s a bit of a cut (or something that feels like a cut) on the tip of my tongue.  This can also be called an apical cut of the tongue.  And it&rsquo;s really annoying.</p>

<p>Everytime I move it against my teeth or eat something salty or anything at all, I&rsquo;m reminded that it&rsquo;s there.  It&rsquo;s like a little kid who keeps tapping you on the shoulder saying, &ldquo;Here I am, play with me.&rdquo;  Not that playing with little kids is bad.  So maybe it&rsquo;s more like a little kid tapping you on the shoulder saying, &ldquo;Here I am, clean up my poo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So what solution do I have for this?  Nothing.  I&rsquo;ve got nothing.  But here are some points that I&rsquo;ve thought:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s on the tongue inside of your mouth so that eliminates the usual antiseptic and bandaging for cuts to the skin.  Since the mouth is well-known to be full of germs, it is really unfortunate that they&rsquo;re nothing that can be done about this.  Maybe saliva protects it?  Maybe not.</p></li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s supposedly the strongest muscle.  How do they know this?  I have no idea.  Whether it is or is not doesn&rsquo;t matter so much as the fact that it is almost always moving.  That makes it hard for the cut to really settled down, kick back, and recover.</p></li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s necessary for eating.  We can&rsquo;t just bypass the tongue by sticking a feeding tube through our nose or veins, can we?  Okay I guess that we could.  But we won&rsquo;t because that is just unreasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>How do people that bite their tongue in their sleep deal with this?!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So you understand that a cut in the mouth must be annoying.  But you know that there are a lot of other annoying things out there such as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Cold sores.  Especially if they&rsquo;re big.  Especially if they&rsquo;re in the crack between your lip and your gum.  Especially if you&rsquo;re at a celebration banquet with lots of good food but which when put inside your mouth actually gets stuck in the cold sore and pokes it, aggravating it even more until you&rsquo;re at the point of torture.  Yeah that&rsquo;s never happened to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper cuts.  A million of these would be absolutely unbearable torture.  One of them is pretty bad, too.</p></li>
<li><p>Pinched nerves/muscle knots.  Whether you slept wrong, you exercised too much, or anything else that you did, these are so annoying as to make you think about them constantly for the day or two that they last.  You almost can&rsquo;t do anything but complain about it (whether out loud or in your head).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So after all of this, the conclusion is that either I get annoyed very easily or there are a lot of annoying things out in the world.</p>
