And I must say, it was quite nice!</p> <p>I wanted to write this down partly for myself, just so that I can remember it all.</p> <p>Starting the day before the rehearsal some of the groomsmen hung out with Daniel, the groom. It wasn’t too outrageous at all.</p> <p>Then the day of the rehearsal (the day before the actual wedding) was quite busy. Rental car, drove up ~60 miles to the church (in LA) for the rehearsal. Got there in time (even with workday traffic). Fun rehearsal! For some reason it seemed pretty amusing. (Oh and I might have tested out the sanctuary to see how my laugh would echo. And other people might have told me to not dare laugh the day of the wedding. :P) Rehearsal lunch. Food was good, and the conversation was fairly flowing. Hotel. The hotel messed up. Unhappiness. Ah oh well. Go-karts. Better at it than I thought. (I guess that even though I can rant <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/27/on-driving/">On Driving</a>, I might very well have an aggressive driver in me!) Got 2nd out of our group (thanks a lot Mike haha). Hm where is my trophy? Dinner with Daniel’s family. Late, but it worked out. Sat with some of his extended family and another groomsman. Got to hear about New Mexican food and their amazing miracle chili sauce. (I’ve never tried it, but I’d be very willing at this point!) Hotel. Get ready for sleep. Gifts from groom. Talk. Sleep.</p> <p>Up at 6:30 AM (it was a 10:30 AM wedding) to get ready. Out of the hotel by 8 AM. Do random stuff at the church and sit around looking good for a couple of hours. Walk down the aisle. Stand. Stand. Feet hurt. Stand. And done! Get out of there, help with more random stuff. Reception. Kiss kiss. See old friends from college. Nice. Good lunch. Real nice. Slideshow. Oh sweet they put me in it more than once. Drive back down to pick up my car from the groom’s place, and that’s a wrap!</p> <p>I enjoyed my time being a part of their wedding. I’m glad that I at least got to be in one! Haha I think that I’m probably good in terms of wedding experiences. That is I don’t need to be a part of another one. Except as groom. That’s one experience that I’m pretty positive that I want!</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://www.micahgilmore.com/">Micah Gilmore</a> has a <a href="http://blog.micahgilmore.com/">blog</a> with:</li> </ol> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>* [Wedding Day](http://weblog.xanga.com/micahs22action/647567516/staceydaniel.html)

</code></pre> </div> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/my-reminder-system/"> My Reminder System </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 14</span> <p>Remembering something is usually a case of you did or you didn’t. I’ve often found it amusing for things like birthdays when people will say that they remembered, but they just didn’t say anything about it. Really…well that’s hard to imagine.</p> <p>The thing is, some people have better memories than others. Everyone is different and is able to remember things in different ways. Laugh if you must, but I remember wanting a photographic memory like Cam Jansen when I was a kid. Then I could rapidly flip through books and not need to study! How wonderful that would have been! But alas, my dreams did not come true. Even now I often wish for a better memory.</p> <p>But just as remembering something is pretty binary (i.e. you did or you didn’t), those of us lacking in the memory department have to make do with what we have. Otherwise we will be mocked. Who will mock, I do not know. All I know is that mocking will occur.</p> <h4 id="memory-aids-that-i-use">3 Memory Aids That I Use:</h4> <ol> <li> <h5 id="remember-the-milk">Remember The Milk</h5> </li> </ol> <p>(RTM for short)</p> <p>Besides having a pretty amusing name, this is a website whose sole purpose is to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_%28computer_programming%29#Tags">TODO</a> lists. It’s refreshing for a website to be so singular in its purpose in this day of do-everything-until-we-take-over-your-life websites. In any case, I initially signed up for an account on the site, thought it was cool, and promptly did not hardly ever use it because visiting another site everyday wasn’t too practical.</p> <p>But then they developed a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> extension that changed that up! They developed an extension for placing an RTM pane whenever a Gmail tab is opened! It maintains the overall look and feel of gmail so you (or at least I) don’t feel like it’s out of place at all. Since I much more often have a browser tab open for Gmail, I was much more able to use the service. And I have. And it’s great!</p> <p>The concept is nothing new, you just put in due dates. But since it’s in front of my face at least once a day (since I check my e-mail once a day), it’s actually useful. And it’s on a remote server so I don’t need to worry about losing it or keeping different lists in sync.</p> <p>So there are 2 ways to use this baby:</p> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>* [Gmail for RTM extension](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/gmail/)

But that doesn’t mean that my phone is dumb! (Ha…ha…)</p> <p>But almost all phones nowadays have some sort of calendar feature. And that’s fine and dandy for checking what the date is. But there is often also the ability to schedule events. So I use my phone (a Motorola, by the way) and put in reminders for certain things that I need to get done.</p> <p>This is especially useful when I’m out and about. Often my phone is one of the few things that I’ll carry with me. I could actually text message a reminder to RTM which is cool. But I’ll be honest, I’m cheap when it comes to text messaging. And Verizon charges $.15 per message. For the amount of reminders that I put in for myself, that could get pricey. Haha laugh if you want, but the calendar reminders are free.</p> <ol> <li></li> </ol> <h5 id="google-calendar">Google Calendar</h5> <p>Calendars have been around for ages. The print versions are still quite popular and understandably so. But as computer usage becomes more and more prevalent, we are transferring much of the things that we do in tangible form to things that we can do through using the computer.</p> <p>Personally I use the Google calendar, but really there are many such applications floating around. I figure that I already have a Gmail account, so why not. (Of course, this line of reasoning sounds that in my post <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/10/22/googles-taking-over-the-worldand-i-dont-like-it/">Google’s Taking Over The World…And I Don’t Like It</a>.)</p> <p>Anyways, a nice feature of Google calendar is that I can have it e-mail me before the event occurs. I don’t use the application everyday, but awhile back I input all of my friends’ birthdays. Now it will e-mail me the day before someone’s birthday, so I’ll never egregiously forget a friend’s birthday!</p> <p>Granted, it’d be better if I just remembered. It would show that I care more. It’s not that I don’t care. It’s just that I don’t want to make a mistake! It’s my failsafe, if you will.</p> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>* [Google Calendar website](http://www.google.com/calendar)
</code></pre> </div> <p>Do you have other tips for fellow forgetful fellows (or gals)?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/yelp-like-you-love-it/"> Yelp Like You Love It </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 3</span> <p>One thing that the Internet is an amazing tool for is the ability to draw on collective knowledge. By being so easy to reach more people, we are able to better understand things. We can, as a society, collaborate and pool our individual pieces of the puzzle to form a more completely picture. I’m getting away from myself with the metaphors. Anyways, I think that one of the more useful applications of this for me is <a href="http://www.yelp.com">yelp.com</a>.</p> <p>Basically I like to eat, and yelp helps me do that well.</p> <p>So yelp isn’t at all a new website, and I kind of think that a lot of people have already heard of and/or used it before. But it doesn’t matter because you know what? I get to post whatever I want to since this is my site. :)</p> <p>I meant to post this quite some time back, but I’ve been sitting on this post for a really long time. And the only reason is because I wanted to upload a picture before I posted a link to my yelp page. How lame is that? How hard is it to get a profile picture nowadays? It took me all of 2 minutes to accomplish that strenuous task.</p> <p>Personally I’ve found this site to be pretty helpful, and I think that it’s worthwhile to me to be involved with it. The premise is that reviews will be made by people that actually go to different establishments. While I use the site mainly for food, they do have reviews of everything from shopping to entertainment to health centers.</p> <p>The most useful thing to me seems to be that you can limit your search by location and see a map of where these places are in relation to where you are. Because even though I might be looking for some amazing food, I’m not exactly willing to drive 50 miles to get said amazing food into my mouth. But 5 miles for some pretty reasonably tasty food? Yeah I could go for that. You can also further filter the results based on more specific criteria such as food ethnicity.</p> <p>Running off of a 5-star system, it’s easy to quickly see how popular a restaurant is. For more in depth (and often rather interesting) reviews, there are the user comments. These usually range from the short and not-too-helpful to the long and exceedingly useful. Many reviewers will describe their entire meal experience, and it helps you get a feel for what a restaurant is like without actually having been there. Sometimes you can find very useful menu suggestions in the comments as well. To reward reviewers, you can designate their comment as one that you thought was either cool, useful, or funny.</p> <p>There is even a social aspect to this site as you can add friends on it. I’m not sure if that’s something that I’m really going for. According to yelp, I currently have no friends. Haha let’s hope that’s only on yelp!</p> <p>My own page, with my reviews and info, is <a href="http://derekwong.yelp.com">derekwong.yelp.com</a>. Check out some places that I’ve been to, but more importantly let’s all help each other out by supporting quality establishments. You’ll be thankful that next time you’re looking for a place to go to on your hot date. Because we all know that the key to the hot date is the food. Personality? Eh. Charm? Blah. Looks? Well you can’t help that anyways.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/profanity-without-using-curse-words/"> Profanity Without Using Curse Words </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 26</span> <p>Profanity is often used in society in order to express discontent. From mild, momentary displeasure to extreme fury, humans make use of a seemingly defined set of off-limit words to express their emotions. Often these words reference things which would generally be considered better left unspoken of.</p> <p>What is profanity really? Apparently there are 5 types of swearing (according to Steven Pinker’s <a href="http://amzn.to/NcbRlH">The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature</a> which I found a reference to in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity">the Wikipedia article on profanity</a>):</p> <div style="float:right;margin-left:20px;"><img style="display:block;" alt="profanity" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2305/2292724409_12bf79702c_m.jpg"/><em style="font-size:.8em;">Photo courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/found_drama/">Found Drama</a></em></div> <ol> <li>Dysphemistic - Opposite of euphemism. Force listener to think about negative thing</li> <li>Abusive - Abuse, intimidate, or insult others</li> <li>Idiomatic - Refer to (but do not explicitly mention) something in order to arouse interest, be macho/cool, or express to peers that the setting is informal.</li> <li>Emphatic - Emphasize what is being said (pretty self-explanatory)</li> <li>Cathartic - Rid oneself of negative feelings by outwardly expressing it</li> </ol> <p>I can see how all of these are accurate descriptions for how profanity is used. It’s very interesting to study profanity and how it comes about. How it is sociological in a sense because profanity in our language is different from profanity in other languages (even taking into account translation). That’s not the issue.</p> <p>The issue is that profanity comes out of your mouth much more than you’d like to admit. I feel your pain, it comes out of mine more than I’d like to admit, too.</p> <p>In fact, I’ve told people before that I do not cuss. And I’m absolutely correct in a strict sense of the term. I don’t use those words that society has impressed upon me as being profane. In fact, I don’t feel like I need to use profanity in order to express myself. I do feel the same emotions that my cursing brothers feel. (Okay I don’t actually have blood brothers, but I mean it in the mankind term.) And yet I don’t see that it’s too necessary. Am I aghast when I hear it? Not extremely so. Well I’m not with those from whom I expect nothing better. Some people are held to a higher standard, but I digress.</p> <p>So I don’t cuss. But the thing is that I’ll cuss in spirit. I’ll use nice versions like “darn”, “crap”, and “shoot” instead of the usual fare. But does that make it any better? No, I’m beginning to think that it does not matter much at all. Even though the words are different and less offensive to the ear according to society, the usage shows that my mouth is still overflowing with what is in my heart. And I can see that all is not right in that region of my chest. I’m not as loving or as good as I profess.</p> <p>Ah if only the distance between my head and my heart weren’t so far.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/difference-between-nerd-geek-and-dork/"> Difference Between Nerd, Geek, And Dork </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 15</span> <p>The common thought is that nerds, geeks, and dorks are one and the same. However, I don’t think so. Semantics, shemantics, you say.</p> <p>Although they seem very similar, I’m gonna have to go with a “yeah I don’t think so.” Looking them up online doesn’t provide definitive results, but I am still convinced. (Looking them up online does prove amusing because apparently the first definition of <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=nerd&amp;db=*">nerd</a> is “a stupid, irritating, ineffectual, or unattractive person.” Stinks to be called unattractive in the dictionary.)</p> <p>First off, the most important thing to note with any of these terms is that they can have both negative and positive connotations. I think that it mainly depends on your self-awareness. So if someone calls you a nerd, and you think of yourself as a nerd, then it’s not so bad. However, if you think that you’re a cool guy and you get called a nerd, all is not right with the world. As in many things in life, the failing of some expectation will result in your disappointment. And sadness. And low self-esteem. You get the point.</p> <p>Alright so back to the matter at hand. (Cue “Nothin’ But A G Thang”! <del>Hm I thought there was a rap song with “back to the matter at hand,” but I can’t find the song, let alone one that I could listen to in order to verify that. So…you get a small lame comment about how I tried and failed to remember a rap song of old.</del>) Okay back to it, really now.</p> <p>Here is the breakdown of the different types (at least in my mind):</p> <ul> <li><strong>Nerd - intelligent, industrious, understands things</strong></li> </ul> <div style="float:right;margin-left:20px;"><img style="display:block;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2261/2263814806_705169093b_o.jpg" alt="computer programming"/><em style="font-size:.8em;">Courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mjryall/">Matt Ryall</a></em></div> <p>By day I’m a software engineer. (By night a superhero, but that’s another matter.) So I’m obviously a little biased if I give a good definition for a word and also remind everyone that it can describe me. But whatever, it’s what I actually think.</p> <p>Some computer programmers (but by no means all of them) generally tend to be of the sort of people that want to delve deeper into understanding issues than others would. They want to truly understand how something works rather than just settling for using the end product. In the case of computer programming, while everyone else is content with looking at websites, using applications, and generally enjoying the products of the computer programming, the programmers themselves are working to create those products. And if they’re not creating them, then they’re trying to understand them.</p> <p>Some of them might not be like that, but those are the kind that will end up not being very good at what they do. Those are the ones that do not have <a href="/professional-integrity/">Professional Integrity</a>. They’ll also end up being your boss, but more on that later.</p> <p>In a general sense, nerds can be from all different backgrounds. But I think that they can generally be described as someone who is willing to study and do the work in order to learn the stuff. I’m not quite sure that someone who is naturally gifted with intelligence but who doesn’t utilize it can be categorized as a nerd. No, I take that back. They cannot be categorized as a nerd. They’re just smart and lazy. Really, how much worse can you get? I think that most people would rather be dumb and hard-working than smart and lazy.</p> <div style="float:right;margin-left:20px;"><img style="display:block;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2042/2263025755_b6b8488e2f_o.jpg" alt="studying"/><em style="font-size:.8em;">Courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sveinhal/">Pragmagraphr</a></em></div> <p>Nerds can often be found in libraries, hunched over books, or wondering aloud about their surroundings. “Nerd” seems to be used most often in a complimentary way when describing others.</p> <p>Someone can very well be a nerd, and you wouldn’t be able to tell from the outside appearance. The stereotype of the nerd is a skinny guy with glasses and a pocket protector. But something that I learned in college is that the surfer dude can be just as much of a nerd as the stereotype. He just hides it better. Much better.</p> <p>The unfortunately sad thing about the term nerd is that it doesn’t just apply to those that work hard. They actually have to be good at whatever it is that they’re doing, whether school or work. Someone that works hard but who still is not as successful is just that, a hard worker. (Of course, a hard worker is <em>still</em> better than a smart lazy person.)</p> <p>Basically, nerds rule. They’re even better when they know that they’re nerds and are not socially inept.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Geek - Interested in things that others are not interested in, know a lot about their interests, but usually do not understand underlying principles</strong></li> </ul> <p>So I mentioned before when talking about nerds that there are computer programmers who will end up not being very good at programming. Unlike the more kindly description that I have above about nerdy computer programmers, these geek programmers fall into another category. And yeah, that category is lower.</p> <div style="float:right;margin-left:20px;"><img style="display:block;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2084/2263025783_bf718f63e3_o.jpg" alt="star trek guy"/><em style="font-size:.8em;">Courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/clausmorell/">ClausM</a></em></div> <p>In their work they will do things that they have no idea the meaning of. Unfortunately, they will sometimes correctly stab in the dark and get something right. That will only reinforce their thinking that their way is working. Stumbling, somehow they manage to get others to help them so that they eventually finish whatever it is that they’re doing.</p> <p>I generally liken geeks more to IT (Information Technology) type of people rather than computer programmers. These are the people that know how to use a computer very well, but who would not be able to program “Hello World.” They can fiddle with and modify settings and properties to no end. They love computers, but they don’t actually know how a computer works. Of course, not all IT folks are like this. In my experience, it just seems like they can more generally be described this way.</p> <p>Even beyond the IT people, geeks can be interested in a wide spectrum of topics. They will often be interested in technology-related things. I think that it’s because not everyone understands these things. Since geeks do not have skills in some areas of life, they want to have an area of expertise where others could not compare to them.</p> <p>So yes, geeks are the types of people that are not only interested in Star Trek, but who will also dress up to go to the premiere. They’ll also buy collector cards, read forums online, and read every single book about Star Trek. Obsess much? Yes they will. But you don’t know where the Klingon Galaxy is located relative to our current position in space, do you??</p> <p>Geeks come in all shapes and sizes. Of course, those are usually the odd shapes and sizes. They are generally not as hard to spot as the nerds because of their disregard for what others think of them. Their clothes don’t match, and they might occasionally offend others with their insufficient personal hygiene.</p> <p>Still, geeks have their strong points. They are dedicated to what they like. They don’t really care that much what other people think about them. And they generally rule the Internet. However, they don’t rule sports, social situations, or tangible environments. They’re awkward in situations that they’re not accustomed to (like the aforementioned) and tend to do things that give away their geekdom like go on incessantly about their favorite topic when the real topic is something entirely different.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Dork - Foolish, stupid, clumsy</strong></li> </ul> <p>There’s not really any two-ways about it, “dork” is not too good of a term. Obviously if someone is using it in an endearing fashion, it’s not too bad. And if someone says it about themselves, it’s usually in an amusing and self-deprecating way. But the term itself doesn’t have too much positive spin on it.</p> <div style="float:right;margin-left:20px;"><img style="display:block;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2374/2263963848_a332a98b72_o.jpg" alt="dork"/><em style="font-size:.8em;">Courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/crankymediaguy/">Cranky Media Guy</a></em></div> <p>Dorks are the type of people who will do silly things. That’s not to say that they’ll necessarily be the ones making grand gestures to make people laugh. But they are comfortable enough with themselves to do things like put a “dork” box on their head and laugh at themselves.</p> <p>If the dork is aware that they are a dork, then it’s funny. If they’re not aware, then it’s painful to watch such a socially uncomfortable person try to get by. Now I’m not sure whether they feel awkward or if they feel at ease with themselves in those situations. All I know is that it’s sometimes hard for me to watch.</p> <p>Once again, there are good traits in the dork. The self-aware dork is able to not take themselves too seriously. They are able to do what they want without caring about others’ opinions. And even the dork who is not self-aware is able to make others feel more comfortable simply because of their silliness.
