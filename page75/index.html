I have found that there are a whole lot of people who have no idea what RSS is. That’s a shame because I think that a lot of them would find it to be useful.</p> <p>RSS stands for <strong>R</strong>eally <strong>S</strong>imple <strong>S</strong>yndication and is a really easy way to view the content for dynamic (frequently changing) websites. Good examples of websites that change frequently are news sites, blogs, etc.</p> <p>I’m sure that you could see the icons (like <a href="http://www.feedicons.com/">this</a>) around the Internet on web pages if you really looked. To utilize this technology, you have to understand what it is. Basically an RSS “feed” is a special link to a website that allows you to quickly see the content that is being changed on the site.</p> <p>So to start off, you obviously you need a feed reader (also called an aggregator or a news aggregator) in order to view the content of your feeds. If you use Firefox you can try <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/424/">this</a> or even subscribe with Firefox itself using “Live Bookmarks”. There are also tons more that you can find online. I tried one from <a href="http://email.about.com/od/rssfeedreaders/Find_the_Best_RSS_Feed_Readers_News_Aggregators.htm">here</a> that worked just fine. Once you have your reader install, you definitely need at least one site to get a feed from. You can find the links on pages, and often times these links will be sensed by your web browser and display an icon in the address bar that makes it easy to subscribe to. An example of a link would be: <strong>http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoingTheWongWay?format=xml</strong> Once you have this link, and input this into your reader in whatever way you are supposed to, you are up and running!</p> <p>To give you even more incentive of why you should do this, it turns out that you can use this for other blogging sites that you might not have thought of. For the xanga readers, you are essentially doing this when you read “Your Subscriptions”. You can incorporate xanga sites into your new RSS feed reader using links like <a href="http://www.xanga.com/rss.aspx?user=keleka">this</a> where you just replace the “keleka” part of that address with the user that you’re subscribing to. Add a whole bunch of those links and suddenly you have an easy way to read a whole bunch of different types of “subscriptions”. Happy reading!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/new-look/"> New Look </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 9</span> <p>After seeing <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/02/09/83-beautiful-wordpress-themes-you-probably-havent-seen/">this site</a> on <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a> I realized that I wanted a new theme. So here it is courtesy of one Wolfgang Bartelme. (For now anyways until I want to try out another one!)</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-lost-library/"> The Lost Library </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 8</span> <p>I like to say that I find humor in the everyday issues that arise. It’s there, you just have to know how to handle it. Here are some that I thought especially amusing.</p> <p><strong>The Library</strong> So I’m reading <em>Main Street</em> by Sinclair Lewis (as you can read about <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-reading/main-street/">here</a>) but I’m only halfway done. Additionally I have already renewed it the maximum number of times. So I go to the <a href="http://www2.anaheim.net/article.cfm?id=118">library</a> and find the other copy to check out. Just before I get to the line to check it out, this lady comes in with her son and a BOX of books to donate or something. Additionally the other librarian is occupied with someone who has a whole bunch of questions. Thus I ended up waiting along with this other lady. We also happened to be right next to their new self-checkout machine. The lady and I discussed that we should try it. So I did. I put my library card down to scan, and then I tried to scan the book. But I used the wrong bar code. In this time an old asian guy cut in front of us and took the librarian just as she was free from the question lady. I was tempted to say something but I had pity on him because he was old. Plus we were really looking at the machine so I guess it’s slightly valid. But only slightly. Anyways, I forgot that the library has their own bar code inside the front cover rather than the general bar code on the back. When I realized this, I tried again and it worked! Happily I walked out and set off the alarm. As soon as I heard it I burst into laughter. Now anyone who has heard me laugh knows that it is slightly unbecoming a person in a public library. Haha apparently I forgot to push the spine against the edge in my self-checkout process. Suffice to say I thought it was funny, but the people reading quietly might not have.</p> <p><strong>Lost</strong> I’m sure many people watched <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index">Lost</a> last night. And there are probably loads of posts about what happened and how exciting or dull or horrible it was. But I would venture to say that none of those blog posts are the same as this one. As I was watching the episode, I saw something that triggered my memory. That beach that Sawyer and Kate were on at the end when leaving the island…<strong>I was on that beach!</strong> Now you will probably want to know why or how I know this. Well this past summer I went to Hawaii for a couple of weeks with some friends. One of my friends has a place out there because he’s going to school there so he knows of all of these local spots. One day we went to this random beach where nobody was. There might have also been a sign somewhere that said to stay off, but I can’t exactly remember. Haha anyways it was fun and the beach was very picturesque. It was in this little cove/bay with a big house on one side. We snorkeled and looked at coral and stuff. It was quite nice. As we were leaving we also heard some people on horseback walking by and talking about how Lost was filmed there. I thought that was cool but thought nothing more of it until last night. I saw that beach and I am fairly certain that was the beach that we were at. Haha I thought that was awesome and hilarious. Well the hilarious part was telling my sister about it and her being incredulous that I <em>might</em> not have supposed to have even been there. :D</p> <p>Amusing stuff, my life. Anyone’s can be, you just need to know where to look.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/superbowl/"> Superbowl </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 4</span> <p>So I’m sure that there are many entries out in the blog world about the exciting moments from the Superbowl, funny commercials, and numerous other topics. <strong>This one is more important.</strong></p> <p>Let me tell you, what stood out to me when I was watching the coverage and heard the stories about everything, was the life of Tony Dungy.</p> <p>If you are unaware of who this is, he is the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts (the winning team of the Superbowl). As I was hearing his story and reminded of the fact that this was the man who lost his 18-year old soon all too recently, I could not help but feel that this man had to be living differently. His players and peers talked about how much they respected him, how he did not cuss (where the only time that he did was when he said that he was going to be on the “Best Damn Sports Show”), and numerous other character traits. So I looked him up to see if he was a Christian. And here are some of the things that I found: <a href="http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_63714.asp">link 1</a> <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/feature/featureVideo?page=amazinggrace">link 2</a> and many others.</p> <p>Here is a man who is unafraid to live differently, who affects the lives of those around him even in a sub-culture of extreme opulence and outrageous antics. He is a man who strives to be the best, is currently there, but does not let that stand in the way of who he really is. Whether on top or on bottom, he is someone who seems to me has got it straight. And I like that.</p> <p>If I had known about this before, I would have cheered a little harder for the Colts (not that I was cheering for the Bears anyways). Nevertheless my hats off to a man can do what seems to be so difficult in the world today: he brings his Christian beliefs into his life simply be being who he is. He makes people <em>ask</em> why he is the way that he is. He fights the good fight seemingly with his head squarely on his shoulders and his feet squarely on the Rock.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/dns-confusion/"> DNS Confusion </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 2</span> <p>So last night I encountered a fairly common error. For some reason (I still don’t know why) the Internet connection at home was not working. Now this meant that I would have to renew the IP address (and thereafter update the DNS to reflect this change). I had done this at least once before so it was pretty straightforward.</p> <p>HOWEVER, after changing the host record on <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">namecheap’s</a> site, the DNS would still not redirect me to the correct IP address (my own). Bah, so I figured that there was a refresh problem and just went to sleep. (I also turned off the server as I do every night in case you might be wondering why you can’t get to it at night). I woke up this morning and checked it out to see what was up. Still no change. How could this be?! I tried updating it and checking it over and over. I finally realized something was terribly wrong. I thought that perhaps it had to do with submitting my site to google’s index so I tried removing it. I have since realized that probably has nothing to do with it. Then I came to the conclusion that namecheap might not be as optimal as previously thought. That’s too bad. But no love lost since it’s not a big deal. Thus I transferred the DNS services to <a href="http://zoneedit.com/">zoneedit</a> which has an ugly site but has good reviews. They took a little while (~30 min) to transfer the DNS as well as update the host record. Pretty good. We’ll see how it holds up.</p> <p>So in sum, we’re back online! :D</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page76">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page74">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
