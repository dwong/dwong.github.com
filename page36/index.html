You’re on the home stretch, and you’re trying to kick out the last of the run. Then all of a sudden you look back and there’s a dog weighing perhaps 75 pounds running at you and barking. You had just seen the owner go into their house to put something away and nobody was around.</p> <p>What would you do?</p> <ol> <li> <p>Try to outrun it</p> </li> <li> <p>Squat down and receive it with arms open wide, all the while oohing and ahhing at the cuteness of it all</p> </li> <li> <p>Yell like a madman for help</p> </li> <li> <p>Cover your crotch with one hand and hope for the best</p> </li> <li> <p>Cry like a baby</p> </li> <li> <p>Play with it</p> </li> <li> <p>Fight it</p> </li> </ol> <p>Yeah I can’t even think of any other possibilities. Tell me what you’d do, guess what I did, and then check out <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/05/28/neighborhood-dogs/2/">the next page</a> for a fun picture.</p> <p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3186/2530479444_e32106f489.jpg" alt="Dog Scratches"/></p> <p>Yep, covered up and hoped for the best. I think that all things considered, I came out alright.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/pleasantly-surprised-horribly-disappointed/"> Pleasantly Surprised > Horribly Disappointed </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 22</span> <p>Expectations. We have them about all kinds of things. Sometimes we base them on our experiences, but more often we seem to base them on our hopes and dreams. We can have them about things like birthdays, get-togethers, and other events. In our mind’s eye we see people being caring and loving, friendly and jolly. It’s not always so, is it?</p> <p>But besides that, we can even have expectations about much more concrete matters. When we sit in the chair, we have that dreamy expectation that the chair will hold up our weight. If that expectation isn’t met, we sure aren’t too happy! And so it goes moment by moment with all sorts of things that we encounter.</p> <p>More recently I’ve noticed how much people do this with things that they don’t understand. Or rather, I’ve noticed how this comes into play when people are dealing with those things that most of us do not fully understand. Things like televisions, computer programs, and automobiles will all sorely disappoint us when we expect them to work and they do not. But when we don’t know what to expect, and things work how happy are we?</p> <p>When we try out a shortcut key and find that some programmer has made sure that shortcut key works aren’t we pleasantly surprised? Or when we go to a website, make a guess at what to do, aren’t we glad for whoever made it work just so?</p> <p>I emphasize the computer software, but it’s obviously more.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/group-friendship/"> Group Friendship </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 15</span> <p>When I think of friendship, I initially think of a relationship between one person and another. They can be all sorts of combination of guys and girls (okay so really there are only 4 combinations if there are 2 people involved). But have you noticed how different everything is when a group is involved?</p> <p>Imagine, if you will, going into a situation where you’re trying to get in with a whole group of people. Individually you are able to interact pretty well with them. Conversation is pretty easy, common ground is found, life is good.</p> <p>But as a whole when you’re with them things are not well. You are left standing there thinking, “What am I doing here?” You don’t follow their inside jokes. And you definitely haven’t known them for as long as they have known each other.</p> <p>Why the difference? It seems strange to me to be able to be friends with them individually but have trouble with them when they are all a group. But it happens. Related to mob mentality? Who knows, you got me.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-real-better-half/"> The Real Better Half </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 7</span> <p>Have you heard people talk about their spouse as “their better half”? It’s an interesting (and kind) thing to say. Often it’s the guy talking about his wife, but not always so. It’s slightly demeaning towards the “lesser half” (often self-deprecating since that person will say it about themselves) but that’s supposed to be hidden by the elevation of the spouse.</p> <p>So my question is, how can both of them be the better half? I really don’t think that can be the case. I had a talk quite sometime back about this. We talked about different couples that we know, and sad as it was we realized that we could usually think of one person in the relationship who was a better catch. We weren’t trying to be mean (at least I don’t remember that being the intention, I think it was just a commentary on things that we saw). Still, it’s an interesting thought huh?</p> <p>Think of a couple, and I’d hazard a guess that you could think that one of them is a bit of a better catch than the other. Now why this might be will obviously change from case to case.</p> <p>Why did I write this? I don’t know, I just thought about it all of a sudden. And I thought it was an interesting thought. Don’t read into it too much or your head will hurt. And nobody likes headaches. Nobody. But do appreciate your other half for <del>what</del> who they are!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/i-dont-follow-celebrities-lives/"> I Don't Follow Celebrities' Lives </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 30</span> <p>How many people do you know who are more interested and involved in the lives of celebrities than in the lives of those around them? Too many? Yeah, me too.</p> <h4 id="who-are-they">Who Are They?</h4> <p>In the realm of entertainment, there are actors, musicians, athletes, and people who are nothing else except somehow rich. They all come together at events, walk around the same streets that we do, and have lives that occasionally defy soap operas in their outrageousness. But why are there people who don’t personally know the celebrities interested in them at all? Is it because they seem to belong to a higher social caste than we? Is it because they are prettier, richer, and more talented than us? Is it because they do things that we wouldn’t even dream of doing?</p> <h4 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h4> <p>Really I just don’t know why us common folk are interested in them. All I know is that I see people all over the place who are far more interested in celebrities (who they do not know) than in their friends and family (who they do know). Something doesn’t seem right about that does it?</p> <p>I really don’t think that celebrities are that interesting. I respect their talent, and I’m definitely not opposed to entertainment. But I don’t care what kind of a drink they ordered at Starbucks last Wednesday or who was seen schmoozing with who at the hot club in Las Vegas. Nor do I care to use any of my brain to remember any other unnecessarily small fact about them. What kind of a world do we live in where we know the favorite candy of a star and don’t even know what is really going on with the guy right next to us?</p> <p>It’s time to stop immersing ourselves in others’ lives and time to start living our own! (Or at least immerse yourself in someone’s life who knows that you exist. Who knows, something worthwhile might even come out of it.)</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page37">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page35">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
