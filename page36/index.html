  <div class="entry-content"><p>People will get proud over anything.  Even those that have nothing to be proud of will somehow find themselves becoming proud of something.  It&rsquo;s rather amazing really.  When you stop to think about it, none of us really has anything to be proud of.</p>

<p>There are a wide variety of things that pride is claimed.  I think that the most ridiculous ones are those things over which we have no control.  Here are some of my favorites:</p>

<ol>
<li><h4>Nationalism/Patriotism/Geographic devotion</h4></li>
</ol>


<p>This is rampant around the world and throughout all of time.  However, it&rsquo;s rather silly to be proud of where you come from simply because that&rsquo;s where you came from, don&rsquo;t you think?  Sure it&rsquo;s a great way to connect to people when you first meet them, but how much do you really have to be proud of if you grew up somewhere?  Usually it&rsquo;s not too much.</p>

<p>I think that perhaps the only thing that I could understand about this is if one had to grow up in a difficult environment.  It shapes a person to be able to grow up in that type of surrounding.  But for all of those people who are proud of where they grew up, what country they were born in, what their heritage is, and so on, you better rethink it.  Because you had no hand in that.</p>

<p>And to think that people get into wars over this issue all of the time is mind boggling.  You mean to tell me that you hate that guy because of where he was born?  But he had no control over that, he didn&rsquo;t choose to be born there!</p>

<ol>
<li><h4>Height</h4></li>
</ol>


<p>Have you met people who were proud of their height?  I think that might be one of the most ridiculous things ever because you absolutely have no control over your height.  You can lose or gain weight, have plastic surgery to fix your looks, and any number of things to modify your physical appearance.</p>

<p>But what can you do about your height?  Diddly squat, I do believe.  Unless you have that limb lengthening surgery.  Anyways, once again you have no control over how tall you are/will be.  You can hope for good genes, but it&rsquo;s much more impressive to just be able to deal with those that you&rsquo;ve been given.  And better yet, it&rsquo;s impressive to be able to overlook (no pun intended) it in others.</p>

<ol>
<li><h4>Discovering Music Artists/Clothing Brands</h4></li>
</ol>


<p>I mean really?  You&rsquo;re going to be proud of the fact that you found out about a band before anyone else did?  You had no hand in their success.  You&rsquo;re not playing bass or pounding those drums for them.  All you did was take a little listen.</p>

<p>Okay sure, it&rsquo;s very nice that you spend the time and try out different artists than the popular fare served up to the masses.  Maybe you even spent a little bit of money to try them out.  But when the band becomes popular, if you find yourself bringing up the fact that you listened to them for years, I&rsquo;ll have you know that I think that you&rsquo;re a lame-o.</p>

<p>Same thing goes for clothing brands (and probably a slew of other things).  You&rsquo;re not making the clothes, you&rsquo;re just buying a sweater.  $20 bucks.  You daredevil you.</p>

<ol>
<li><h4>Age</h4></li>
</ol>


<p>Whether you&rsquo;re young or old, what can you really say about your age?  It won&rsquo;t change a lick no matter what you do.  You can lie about it, you can deceive others by changing your appearance, but this is an absolute in this world that you have no control over.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s so interesting when people see their age as something to be proud of.  In the past I&rsquo;ve seen it because people think that they&rsquo;re immediately wiser for the simple fact that they&rsquo;ve lived more days.  I grant them that it&rsquo;s generally true that wisdom comes with age.  But isn&rsquo;t that usually more like decades of experience?</p>

<p>Growing up in school, I was meeting people with years or less worth more days who thought that they were somehow wiser than I.  I thought (and still do) think that is just ludicrous.  It&rsquo;s like they can&rsquo;t find anything to be proud of so they just grasp for something that nobody can change.  How about instead of doing that we go out and actually gain some of that useful wisdom by getting a life, huh?</p>

<ol>
<li><h4>Salvation</h4></li>
</ol>


<p>Well I&rsquo;m a Christian.  Maybe you knew that, maybe you didn&rsquo;t.  Now you do.  Anyways, I&rsquo;ve got a bone to pick with those people that speak of their salvation with an air of superiority, as if they did anything at all except believe.  This might stir up the pot a little bit, but there isn&rsquo;t much that separates you from that unsaved guy next to you.  I boast in Jesus Christ, too, but He did the work, not I.  I just said, &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll believe.&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know what I&rsquo;m talking about.  It&rsquo;s that feeling that you get when you do something really hard or super embarrassing.  You know, like when someone catches you dancing when you thought that you were alone or when you ask someone out or peeing in your pants in front of the entire class or saying something stupid that you immediately knew that you should not have said pr maybe you just told someone that you were master of the Earth, stood on a railing on a large ship, spread your arms, and fell overboard.</p>

<p>You know, it&rsquo;s that embarrassed, how can I live with myself, I can&rsquo;t stop saying &ldquo;oh my goodness&rdquo; feeling.  I love it.</p>

<p>I think that I&rsquo;m a late bloomer because sometimes I act like I&rsquo;m in junior high.  Haha I love it and hate it all at the same time.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m constantly stuck wondering how in the world people do all of the things that they do when I can&rsquo;t even begin.  It&rsquo;s like everyone else is lifting weights, and I&rsquo;m still stuck trying to gain admission to the gym.  So I have one question: WHERE DO YOU PAY THE DUES?!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve come to notice recently that relationships are very similar to a house of cards.</p>

<p>Alright they&rsquo;re not always like a house of cards, they very much can be in certain ways.  When one is just starting to get to know another person, there is a lot of feeling out in conversation.  Both people need to be talking and questions need to be asked.  This is some basic knowledge about relationships.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2040/2153285874_fd145e3f75_o.jpg" alt="cards" /><em>Photo courtesy of flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/privatenobby/">privatenobby</a></em></p>

<p>Almost more importantly than how to build a relationship, though, is how easy it is to destroy it.  It&rsquo;s important to know how relationships can be destroyed because that is the only way that it can be avoided.  It seems to me that I can very easily liken the building of a relationship to the creation of a house of cards.  For both creations it takes far greater time and effort to build them up than it takes to destroy them.  With the house of cards all you need is an inadvertent swipe of the hand or even an exhaled breath to cause it all to come tumbling down.  With relationships (whether friendships, romantic relationships, or otherwise) a simple outburst, a snide comment, a hurtful action, or even an ill-advised joke can undo all of the time and effort involved in developing a relationship.</p>

<p>I think that whether you&rsquo;ve been on the receiving end of a one of these relationship destroyers or whether you&rsquo;ve dished one out yourself, you know that they&rsquo;re almost never worth it.  Unfortunately I think that most of the time people don&rsquo;t even know what they&rsquo;ve done.  They can&rsquo;t see it because it&rsquo;s not visual, it&rsquo;s within the person.  Take a look around and you&rsquo;ll see cards everywhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Everyone has to perform menial tasks.  Well I guess not everyone, but those of us who actually have to clean our own house, iron our own clothes, and wash our own dishes do.  They&rsquo;re not fun.  That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re deemed menial tasks!  But for myself, I&rsquo;ve found that music is making them much more tolerable.</p>

<p>I think that I was finding that having these tasks to do (not necessarily everyday, but very often) was causing me to start doing them rather begrudgingly.  It&rsquo;s not that I hate the idea of doing work, but I just don&rsquo;t like having multiple completely lacking in fun tasks queued up for me to do.  They&rsquo;re often monotonous and sometimes even physically tiring!  Nobody considers them fun.  But there&rsquo;s hope!</p>

<blockquote><p>Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.<br/>
-Berthold Auerbach</p></blockquote>

<p>People have known for so long that music speaks to us in ways that are indescribable.  And I&rsquo;ve found that simply listening to music while performing tasks that I would not otherwise prefer to do makes them all the more bearable.  Now whether that&rsquo;s because I can dance around, hum, or bob my head, who&rsquo;s to say?  All I know is that it&rsquo;s there, and it&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>From John Mayer to DJ Maj to Al Green to Frank Sinatra to Deitrick Haddon &amp; Unity Praise to Norah Jones to Bleach, and so on and so forth, I like me some music.  No point in letting those 100s of CDs worth of music stay silenced.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don&rsquo;t you hate the feeling that you get right after you realize that you&rsquo;ve been caught doing something that you didn&rsquo;t want to do?  It&rsquo;s that feeling where your blood runs cold for a second.  Yeah, I don&rsquo;t like it either.</p>

<p>Even if it&rsquo;s something pretty innocuous and unimportant, I think that that I can definitely still get that feeling.  And that is no good at all.  But at least it teaches us that we should just not be doing whatever we&rsquo;re doing in the first place.</p>

<p>Then you go through the progression of</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am so embarrassed/ashamed.</p></li>
<li><p>I cannot believe that I did that.</p></li>
<li><p>I hate myself for doing that.</p></li>
<li><p>I am resolved to never ever do that again.</p></li>
