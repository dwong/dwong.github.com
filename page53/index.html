It includes links to every page available on my site! The purpose of this is to allow search engine ‘bots (computers that “crawl” through the Internet so that pages can be found through their search engine) to be aware of all of my pages. I’m using the <a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/redir/sitemap-home/">Google Sitemaps plugin</a> which will automatically update the sitemap every time I update or create a post. I’m also using the <a href="http://www.dicontas.co.uk/blog/google-sitemap-utw-tag-wordpress-plugin/">Google Sitemap - append Tags plugin</a> in order to add the tag pages (where you can see all of the posts with that a tag) to the sitemap.</p> <p>I think that it’s cool, although I’m looking for a better way to order it. It seems like it should be ordered based on the number of comments because that’s what I set the option for.</p> <p>Hmm I just installed the <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2005/07/27/popularity-contest-11/">Popularity Contest plugin</a> to see if I could use that in order to calculate how to order the sitemap.</p> <p>And now I just easily set it to calculate the priority based on the Popularity Contest plugin! It uses a priority that is calculated using view count, comments, pingbacks (links to), etc. I also just realized that the sitemap is just ordered by having the most recently changed posts at the top. I suppose that this makes some sense since it is for updating the index of the ‘bot that is crawling it. There is no sense in updating the index of a page that is unchanged.</p> <p>Okay so basically, now you can browse through and check out posts based on their priority. I just recently made a <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/favorite-posts/">Favorite Posts</a> page, but I’m not sure if I should still keep it. Feedback, as usual, is welcome!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/pandemic/"> Pandemic </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 11</span> <p>[pan-<strong>dem</strong>-ik]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>To be widespread or pervasive (often referring to a disease) over a very large area</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>As the world fell further into turmoil, the already pandemic fear of war grew in intensity.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>Using this word conveys much more meaning than simply using “very widespread” because it it speaks of just how extensive it is.

I enjoyed reading his, and I realize now that people might enjoy one that I did as well. I must admit that when I stopped to think, I realized that I actually had not put any pictures of myself on this blog. I am some anonymous (presumably) Asian male who writes for this blog. Well well well that’s interesting. So here we go!</p> <p>I thought that I’d post pictures marking periods of change in my life. Oh and sorry that the quality is not very good. It was partly because I don’t have a quality scanner to get those prints that are only in hard form, and it is also partly on purpose because I don’t want high quality pictures of me floating around on the Internet. You never know what incriminating things people can do to you. ;-)</p> <p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1143/537843608_d7d9d09650_m.jpg" alt="glasses"/> Ah young Derek, eagerly awaiting his birthday cake. I believe it was an ice cream pie. Those are good, indeed. Notice the obscenely large glasses. I believe the proper term for me back then was baller. :P</p> <p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1210/537843606_854ee8523d.jpg" alt="before_braces"/> This was taken right before I got braces to fix those horrendous canine teeth. <del>bicuspids. (That would be the canine teeth if you didn’t know.)</del> I had fun during that time but boy did those canine teeth <del>bicuspids</del> cut my lips!</p> <p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1061/537843610_f549cce98e_m.jpg" alt="high_school"/> A pictures of myself from high school. Thus marked the end of my strange (for the most part) days. This was taken sometime in the middle of high school. I didn’t like that time period in my life. But the pictures weren’t bad.</p> <p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1080/537843614_1c2ea46538.jpg" alt="in_china"/> Here I am in China, and it is the most recent of the bunch. As you can see, I’m a much more interesting fellow. I’d like to think that I’ve come into my own and am comfortable in my own skin. :D Also notice the advent of the digital camera. Splendid!</p> <p>So in continuing with this fun game, I’d like to tag Shelly at This Eclectic Life, Mat at matkishimoto’s blogspot, Ms. Q at qmusings, and HMTKSteve (strangely enough I don’t know if his name is actually Steve :P) at Ramblings of the Marginalized. You are by no means obliged to do this. I just thought that these would be some interesting people to see what kind of “different” pictures they could put up of themselves.</p> <p>Others who have participated include:</p> <p><strong>Gayla</strong> at Mom Gadget <strong>Char</strong> at Essential Keystrokes <strong>Paul</strong> at Reflections</p> <p><strong>Rob</strong> at 2Dolphins <strong>Zep</strong> at The In-Sect</p> <p><strong>Ingo</strong> at Stixster <strong>Stevie</strong> at Lost In Cyberspace</p> <p><strong>The Paper Bull</strong> at (oddly enough) The Paper Bull <strong>Lisa Sabin-Wilson</strong> at Just A Girl In The World <strong>Dawud Miracle</strong> at dmiracle.com</p> <p><strong>Wendy Piersall</strong> at eMoms at Home <strong>Dennis Bjørn Petersen</strong> at Petersen Inc.</p> <p><strong>Randa Clay</strong> at Randa Clay Design <strong>Drew McLellan</strong> at The Marketing Minute <strong>Becky McCray</strong> at Small Biz Survival</p> <p><strong>Phil Gerbyshak</strong> at Make it Great! <strong>Steve Woodruff</strong> at StickyFigure</p> <p><strong>Dave Olson</strong> at Live the GREAT life that you desire <strong>Greg</strong> at Become a Remote Control SEO <strong>Ariane Benefit</strong> at Neat Living Blog</p> <p><strong>Genesis</strong> at the At Home Mom Blog <strong>Armen</strong> at iFFECT.NET</p> <p><strong>Mihaela Lica</strong> at Online Public Relations <strong>Tara</strong> at Graphic Design Blog <strong>Doris Chua</strong> at Home Office Women</p> <p><strong>Edward Mills</strong> at Evolving Times <strong>Tony D.

After reading <a href="http://qmusings.com/blog/2007/05/27/are-you-afraid-of-hugs/">Are You Afraid Of Hugs</a>, I went on over to the <a href="http://www.freehugscampaign.org/">Free Hugs Campaign</a> website and discovered a very interesting story!</p> <p>A man, feeling alone and disconnected from the world, went out to a local place and offered free hugs with a sign. Now that seems pretty strange if you think about what you’d feel if you saw someone doing the same. I know that I would have thought that he was just a creepy guy trying to feel someone up. But in any case, it turns out that this guy really just wanted to spread the love. And I think that’s an excellent idea!</p> <p>The world we live in truly is disconnected from each other. We see hundreds of people everyday, and we don’t even bother to greet most of them. Even with the people that we do know and talk to, between cellular phones, e-mail, and instant messaging, our communication is distant at best. We don’t look people in the eye as often. And that is just too bad.</p> <p>Hugs are the antithesis of today’s mindset. That is why the Free Hugs Campaign was so revolutionary. It totally went against the norm.</p> <p>In short, I like hugs a lot. Why?</p> <ol> <li> <p>Receiving a hug gives you a certain feeling of being accepted for who you really are</p> </li> <li> <p>Giving a hug lets others know that you care about them in a tangible way</p> </li> <li> <p>Hugs are something that you <em>could</em> do with just about anyone</p> </li> <li> <p>Hugs are free</p> </li> </ol> <p>Give ‘em a chance. I doubt that you’ll regret it.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/i-like-those-posts/"> I Like Those Posts </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 7</span> <p>Well not that I don’t like all of my posts. Because I do. Otherwise I wouldn’t post it! But I think that an especially good idea was for me to make a static page of some of my even <em>more</em> favorite posts. Find the page at <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/favorite-posts/">Favorite Posts</a> where there is a link and a short description of the post. So go on. Visit it. Tell your friends. Tell the world. I’m sure they’re all dying to know how to go the wong way. :D</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page54">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page52">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
