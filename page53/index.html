However, have you ever met someone after you initially saw them and recognized them? Now I might be the only one, but I doubt it. I’m not strange enough to be completely alone here.</p> <p>In any case, I’ve realized something that I think that we would all do well to know. Not meeting someone initially creates an awkward environment. After you’ve already seen them and come to recognize them without having actually met them is a situation in which both of you know that the other exists, but neither of you feel comfortable talking to the other. Not having an introduction can come about in a variety of ways:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Someone didn’t do their duty when they know both of you and introduced you.</p> </li> <li> <p>You are both slightly uncomfortable with meeting strangers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Somehow you already know about the other person, but you know that they have no idea who you are. That makes you afraid to approach them.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Okay I’m sure that there are more ways that this can happen. However it came about, if it happens to you you should know that the longer you wait to talk and/or meet the other person, the more strange it will be when you actually do. So just go for it and introduce yourself. Remember that they might feel just as strange about without knowing your name while seeing you in the halls. Or in a group of people. Or around the neighborhood. Or living right next door to you.</p> <p>The only thing that you have to do after that is not forget that you met them. Because the other person likely did not forget. And then they’ll know that you didn’t care to remember your name. Or even that they met you.</p> <p>Meet ‘em early, not often.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/blase/"> Blasé </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 18</span> <p>[blah-<strong>zey</strong>, <strong>blah</strong>-zey] adjective</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>To be indifferent, unimpressed, or uncaring because frequent exposure.</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>At first the glamor and glitz of living like a movie star was enthralling and exciting, but soon she became blasé even when she would get to fly on private planes to Paris just for lunch.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>A much better word than the more often heard “blah” wouldn’t you say?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/more-favorite-posts/"> More Favorite Posts </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 16</span> <p>And now presenting…</p> <p>favorite posts in the sidebar!</p> <p>Courtesy of the plugin that I used for my sitemap (as described in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/12/a-sitemap-for-you-and-them/">A Sitemap For You And Them</a>), there are now the top (for now 10) posts listed in the sidebar. “Popularity” is a rather arbitrary thing to decide, so my popular posts are based on a calculation using the number of views and responses.

The real finals happened in the West, probably the Suns vs Spurs series. LeBron James gets a lot of attention, but Tony Parker was the one who tore it up. I said as much before the series started that Parker was going to be their downfall.</p> <p>This was one of the least interesting finals series in a long time. Instead of watching game 4 last night, I just decided to wash my truck.</p> <p>The Cavs were so over matched they couldn’t even pull out 1 game (granted, they were close a couple of times). Even the Lakers took one from the Suns! How’s that for an insult?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/ah-summer/"> Ah Summer! </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 14</span> <p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1126/548495930_e714338645_o.jpg" alt="Summer photo CC by flickr user Storm Crypt"/>I was never one for pro con lists. But maybe I’ll start. Here is one for the season that is summer. And one caveat to this post is that must know that I live in sunny southern California, so if you live in some forsaken place then you’ll just have to wish it were different for you. Or you can bask in the cons that I experience and enjoy your freezing cold. Just know this: I wouldn’t trade places with you at all.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong>The sun gives us vitamin D which is needed for, among other things, calcium to be absorbed and used. It also gives you a nice healthy looking glow. <strong>Con:</strong>The sun causes skin cancer. It also causes wrinkles.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong>Can make use of those expensive sunglasses. <strong>Con:</strong>The reflection off of objects is sometimes glaring, especially if we forget to bring those expensive sunglasses.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong>Have more sunlight to play with (or in). <strong>Con:</strong>Having nobody to play with.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong>Summer love. <strong>Con:</strong>Not having anyone to love. Or more likely, having nobody to love you back.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong>Sitting out, enjoying a nice drink on the proverbial porch. <strong>Con:</strong>The stupid bugs that will eat you alive.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong>Vacations to far off places. <strong>Con:</strong>Not having any vacation time. Or having no job and plenty of “vacation time,” but obviously having no money to vacation with.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong>Cruising in your car, looking cool. <strong>Con:</strong>Not having had any rain for a long time, so your car is dirty. Your speakers are not loud enough to make anyone glance again. Your car is laughably unimpressive. You look like a fool.</p> <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/storm-crypt/548084413/">Photo</a> courtesy of flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/storm-crypt/">Storm Crypt</a> and used according to a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.0 license.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page54">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page52">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
