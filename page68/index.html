  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something that goes along with what I touched upon in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/09/your-own-b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s/">this</a> entry is that people are trying to be more and more politically correct.  Now granted, I am all for finding out the truth and discovering what is going on.</p>

<p>However when you have the National Basketball Association going back and reviewing old tapes and determining that a foul should have been called on Kobe Bryant, you are not doing right by the spirit of the game.  I read an article similar to <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=ApY4gUOXWX0Giri7wiHAYoi8vLYF?slug=ap-nba-lakers-jackson&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns">this article</a>, and I was slightly outraged at the ridiculousness of it all.  I&rsquo;m a Los Angeles Laker fan, for better or worse.  And I think that Kobe Bryant is pretty amazing as a basketball player.  But this is not about that.  This is about how people are always trying to be exactly right, holding to the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law.  What is that doing in an entry about sports you ask?  Well people have been applying that idea more and more to sports.  There have been the sudden burst of video replays in college football that have led to some good things (like fixed calls) and some bad things (like long games and still getting the call wrong).  And then there are the extreme cases of outrage where officials such as <a href="http://www.nba.com/nba101/stu_jackson.html">Stu Jackson</a> will re-visit a game simply to find faults.  Where there might have been a regular foul called, they will turn into a suspension.  Now, that just seems like idiocy to me.  Let the officials at the game decide what the call should be.  If you&rsquo;re so willing to make a call after the fact, then how will you be able to overturn a call after the fact?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s irritating to think of the things that are starting to go on the world.  It might seem like I&rsquo;m getting worked up over a stupid game, but it has ramifications in all of the world.  Why?  Because it&rsquo;s not limited to a game, it&rsquo;s the mindset that people are starting to have more and more.  And that is even more troubling than the problems with video review in sports.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading <a href="http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/top-10-funniest-gadgets">this entry</a> a little while ago, I thought it would be appropriate to list some of my favorites.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/420716497_3166567d7c_o.jpg" alt="ipodtp_2" />
Starting off with a slightly horrendous take on this iPod-centric marketing is this piece of work. To imagine anyone in their right mind buying this is absurd. To think, you couldn&rsquo;t live without your iPod for the 5-10 minutes (okay 1 minute if you&rsquo;re <a href="http://www.xanga.com/fonghwang">this guy</a> haha) that you&rsquo;re sitting on the toilet. Take the time to enjoy your time off from your life. Relax and let it all out. And don&rsquo;t touch your iPod before washing or else people will post entries like <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/07/a-scary-thought/">this</a> about you!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/420716505_f45089498b_o.jpg" alt="harder teeth" />
See I personally think that something like this is a good idea. I mean our teeth are used in order to break down food that we eat, right? Well these bad boys will do just that. I have a couple of issues with it, however. Firstly, they need to get a model who is not about to fall asleep as she&rsquo;s wearing the teeth. Secondly, they need to remedy how extremely ugly you&rsquo;ll look when you&rsquo;re wearing them. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_%28James_Bond%29">Jaws</a>, anyone?</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/420716495_b0438c971d_o.jpg" alt="drivemoticon" />
Here is another gadget that actually seems useful. Unfortunately everyone will look at you like a fool if you so happen to actually use one. Everyone is better off when other drivers are considerate and expressive of how they actually feel. Unfortunately technology cannot make advances in all areas. It has to take a back seat some of the time (pun intended :P).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/128/420716507_6a407be63b_o.jpg" alt="fresh air machine" />
Oh man, this is awesome. Now I&rsquo;m all for having cleaner air to breathe, but there are a few issues that I have with this. First off, what kind of mad person is willing to either carry that thing around or be anchored to one spot for a long time? And more importantly, how in the world does a single plant produce that much oxygen for you to breath constantly? I suppose it might make a tiny bit of sense if you just left it to accumulate fresh air and then you took a whiff every now and again. But even that&rsquo;s a stretch.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/421254893_c86d19fdb2_o.jpg" alt="Triumph Japan 2" />
Haha only the Japanese would come up with such a ridiculous invention. (<a href="http://www.triumphjapan.com/release/unique/2006110700166.html">This</a> is why I know it&rsquo;s the Japanese who get credit for this one.) There&rsquo;s no way underwear should be used for anything other than being worn as such. Come on now, that&rsquo;s just gross.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/420716502_8fafc806f5_o.jpg" alt="360 camera" />
One of my favorite! I love the picture. I think that I might have seriously chuckled aloud. And I was by myself. To imagine this being used is actually not all too outrageous because of the high cost of doing this with a device designed for this express purpose. I just would really really like to see someone doing this. I also enjoy how they show you how to truly experience the 360 degree picture that you&rsquo;ve taken. :-p</p>

<p>And to think, I always wanted to invent something cool. Why bother when I can live vicariously through all of these other inventors with the fortitude to do something about it?

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just in time for the unveiling of a favicon for this site:
A post about favicons!  :D</p>

<p>Okay so just what is a &ldquo;favicon&rdquo;?  Well it is basically that small icon that you see next to the url when you go to a site.  There are different icons for different sites as I&rsquo;m sure most of you have noticed.  This is basically a special &ldquo;ico&rdquo; file that is a tiny picture format.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to create one.  At the very simplest you can just go to <a href="http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/">a pretty good online favicon generator</a> and submit a picture to convert.  They&rsquo;ll allow you to download the resulting file.  Then to use this file with your site, you have to upload or somehow place the file on your server, and add this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;link rel="shortcut icon"
href="http://example.com/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"&gt;
&lt;/link&gt;
</code>
to the page that your users will see (typically something like index.html) in between &ldquo;<head>&rdquo; and &ldquo;</head>&rdquo;.  Then you would replace the &ldquo;<a href="http://example.com/favicon.ico">http://example.com/favicon.ico</a>&rdquo; with the corresponding path to get to your file.  And that&rsquo;s it!</p>

<p>Of course you could do things like edit it in the excellent <a href="http://gimp.org/">gimp</a> and add some transparency, etc before you convert it.  And you can obviously use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">adobe&rsquo;s expensive product</a> to do this (although if you already ponied up for this you better know how to make favicons :P).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, you have a nice little personal touch for your website!  Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw a license plate frame this morning on the way to work that looked a little like this:</p>

<p> The Few, The Proud</p>

<p>0ZZZ000</p>

<p>  Native Californians</p>

<p>And I was just wondering who in the world was driving this car?  I <em>thought</em> that it was a woman based on the hair that she had, but who knows?  I thought that maybe she was the wife of a marine because there was a large sticker on the window of the marines.  So I was thinking that she likely would be someone who simply was born and raised on California.  However, I wondered about who truly COULD drive a car with that license plate frame.  Would it be the Mexicans (well Spaniards then I suppose)?  Would it be the native Americans (commonly known as the Indians because of one Christopher Columbus?  Can anyone who is born and raised in California proudly bear the frame on their automobile?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m definitely not a fan of someone who proclaims to be something they&rsquo;re not (imagine someone who graduates from one school driving around with an alumni frame from another school).</p>

<p>Interesting thought don&rsquo;t you think?  I&rsquo;ve never seen that license plate frame, and I&rsquo;m sure that most people wouldn&rsquo;t think much more of it than the fact that they are a proud Californian.  But there seems to be something to it, don&rsquo;t you think?  The dislike of people who proclaim to be something that they&rsquo;re not.  The truth that you find when you dig a little bit deeper.  Or you find the seeming distaste that people have for thinking further than what their next meal would be.  What a tragic life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[uh-<strong>plom</strong>, uh-<strong>pluhm</strong>]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>Poise, composure, or self-assurance.</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>Having to process 1,000 cases in 2 hours was daunting to say the least, but she handled it with aplomb.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This word is a much more interesting word to use than others, and it seems to be somewhat colloquial in its rather specific uses.  Nonetheless it is an interesting word whose simple structure does not betray its true meaning to the uninitiated (translation: you probably can&rsquo;t figure out what it means if you don&rsquo;t already know what it means).  It&rsquo;s usually used when talking about facing difficult circumstances.</p>
