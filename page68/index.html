You’re taking it easy for about 5 minutes as you release your body’s waste. Then you look over. There’s another stall next to you. You look down. Lo and behold! What do you see? A piece of dental floss! “Well that’s strange,” you think. What could dental floss possibly be doing in the bathroom. Now there are a few possibilities:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Someone was flossing while they were sitting on the toilet. After finished with it, they just dropped it on the ground.</p> </li> <li> <p>Somehow there was some dental floss in some guy’s pocket and it came out as he was dropping them to sit on the toilet. He had gone outside to take a “floss break”</p> </li> <li> <p>They were in his underwear because he keeps some dental floss there “just in case” (what that case is where he needs dental floss in his underwear is beyond the scope of this entry)</p> </li> <li> <p>He ate some dental floss and it had come out the other end. How did it get on the floor without stains? Once again, beyond the scope of this entry.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dental floss is raining from the bathroom ceiling</p> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/hello-statistics-how-are-you/"> Hello Statistics, How Are You? </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 21</span> <p>So I’ve been using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">feedburner</a> for stats on my website lately. It’s just a little bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Javascript</a> added to the templates. Pretty simple. Except it wasn’t working today! It kept showing 0 visitors when I know for SURE that there were visitors (like me!). What’s going on??</p> <p>Of course <a href="http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427">Kiki</a> noticed that my theme had changed to the default earlier this morning. I’m not sure what was going on, but it might perhaps be related to that? Anyways the change caused me to look for something else out there that could help me out. I’ve used <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com">site meter</a> before but I don’t like how there’s a little icon when you add the code to your page (although now that I think about it, I realize that I know a lot more about HTML and Javascript now compared to when I added that code to <a href="http://www.xanga.com/keleka">my xanga</a> so I could easily just remove the image and retain the functionality. But that’s a moot point now).</p> <p>So I found <strong><a href="http://www.statcounter.com">statcounter</a></strong> which seems to work very well. There’s more information gathered and available than at sitemeter and it’s more real-time than feedburner was. So I’m pretty happy with it thus far.</p> <p>To make it even better because there’s apparently <a href="http://citizenk.wordpress.com/wp-plugins/statcounter-for-wordpress/">a sitecounter for wordpress plugin</a>! That’s super! (Note: I had to download <a href="http://download.almaren.ch/view.php?file=/code/wordpress/wp-plugins/statcounter/statcounter.php">the php page</a> itself because the zip file was linked incorrectly, but the installation was the same and went smoothly)</p> <p>So I just thought you’d like to know that you’re being tracked a little bit. Not as if you didn’t expect it.</p> <p>I thought that the “blog” category needed another entry so that the “Rant” category could take a well-deserved break. :D</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/coffee-distaste/"> Coffee Distaste </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 21</span> <p>I talked to a co-worker a little bit yesterday as he was getting some coffee at the same time as I was heating up lunch in the microwave. I asked him how much coffee he drinks a day. I was amazed and kind of sickened when he said that he drinks 5-10 cups a day (where he would want to do 10 if it’s possible to get away from his desk).</p> <p>Okay so maybe I wasn’t that sickened, but when he told me that at another job where he sat near the coffee pot (which was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew">drip style</a> coffee maker) and drank 3 pots a day I was definitely grossed out! What in the world?! I, of course, asked him if he felt effects from it, and he claimed that he did not. But I don’t know if I believe him because that is just ridiculous. Plus he then proceeded to talk about how if he drinks coffee with too much sugar he’ll crash from the sugar and get very short-tempered.</p> <p>Wow, extremes like that usually seem pretty outlandish to other people, don’t they? They do to me anyways.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/even-worse/"> Even Worse </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 20</span> <p>You know, there are a lot of things that are “bad” in this world. Obviously sin is a pretty general answer. But without even having to speak on the more heinous things such as actions warranting fines and felonies, we actually see and encounter many things everyday which are not very good at all.</p> <p>Have you ever met someone who simply cares about nothing? What a waste of a life! To simply meander through life without truly being passionate or caring is such a tragedy. To be scared to love simply because one has been hurt, to be scared to take sides simply because one is afraid to be wrong, to be scared of life simply to preserve it. Well those people make me sad. Is there something worse?</p> <p>Well I’m not sure if I would say that it’s “worse,” but it’s definitely pretty high on my list of “bad things.” Now some might disagree and that’s their prerogative.</p> <p><strong>I think that having an opinion (especially a strong one) without any backing is pretty horrendous.</strong></p> <p>I’ve met people that will do this sometimes, but rarely have I truly experienced the full power of this shortcoming. Nonetheless, a glimpse of it is all I need to see that I have a distaste for it.</p> <p>Sure it’s horrible to not feel anything at all. But it seems to me that it’s equally, if not more so, horrible to be swayed this way and that to the extremes without any concrete evidence to back it up.</p> <p>What prompted me to this? Well I’ll be honest and say that sometimes I read other people’s blogs. I also enjoy reading xangas (even though my own is now just an extension of this blog). I have a whole list of “subscriptions” to people that I’ve met over the years. Some of them are friends that I still talk to, while others are not quite as near and dear to my heart anymore. While reading an entry from one of these long-ago acquaintances about <a href="http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/">300</a>, I saw that they made a comment about how stupid it was to have all of these guys dressed how they were with such obscene amounts of computer assistance in making their bodies perfect. Now, being someone who is into “knowing how things work,” I don’t even like how people can assume things about what computers can and cannot do without actually knowing about it (but that’s a topic for another entry). Back to the example. So the reason that reading this entry made me want to write this entry is because I <strong>also</strong> read about <a href="http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=35">the extensive workouts</a> that the actors, stunt doubles, and crew went through before the movie for four months to get the physique that they showed off in the movie.</p> <p>Now what’s the big deal you ask? Well it’s a big deal because it speaks of something deeper! Just like hearing someone who is usually very “good” but will blurt out an expletive in a moment of anger speaks of deeper issues about just how “good” they really are, so also does this strong opinion about the faultiness of the whole production speak of some interesting traits in the opinion-holder. I suggest people do a little research on their own before they speak of things which they have no idea about. Else you will be thought foolish and ignorant by others. And nobody wants to be a fool. And you especially don’t want to be ignorant.</p> <p>This is why I used to get irritated at people on <a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot</a> as well as why I can get irritated listening to IT people sometimes.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/nefarious/"> Nefarious </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 19</span> <p>[ni-<strong>fair</strong>-ee-uh s]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>To be extremely wicked or evil.</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>The nefarious plan to set him up to take the fall for the murder has been going on for ages!</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>I like this word because you can use it for evil!
