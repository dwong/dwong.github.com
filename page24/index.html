How much is it worth everywhere else? It’s usually trouble to dispense knowledge and wisdom to everyone around.</p> <p>People don’t like to be told what to do. Have you ever noticed that it is sometimes harder to tell those that are close to you about something compared to telling those that are not as close? Why is it that a close friend or family member can tell you something that will cause a negative knee-jerk reaction when the same opinion from a perceived detached and objective party will be received well?</p> <p>It seems to me like part of wisdom is knowing when to be quiet and give others a chance to succeed. Surprise, surprise maybe other people don’t want me to solve all of their problems, even if I could. Perhaps maybe a little more love in all things, without which I am nothing even if I am the wisest person in the world.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/maybe-ill-miss-that-pit/"> Maybe I'll Miss That Pit </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 20</span> <p>After reading <a href="http://www.boundless.org/2005/articles/a0002060.cfm">The Long Journey From Obesity</a>, I started to realize that I was like the author before she became an obese person. At times I look down on obese people because I think that it <strong>is</strong> possible for them to lose weight. And while I still do think that it is true for them in a lot of cases, I can easily lose sight of the fact that being skinny is not the most important thing.</p> <p>There are skinny gluttonous people and there are larger fit people. Size is not of the utmost importance. It would do me well to remember this.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/tough-to-say-whether-its-even-decent/"> Tough To Say Whether It's Even Decent </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 18</span> <p>I have been working on a budgeting application called <a href="http://budse.sourceforge.net/">Budse</a> (actually for quite some time now). It’s a straight forward application that allows you to create a set of accounts that have rules assigned to them, which dictate how to split up whole account deposits (e.g., a paycheck). I originally had the idea because I wanted to start budgeting using the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/199/is-the-40-30-20-10-rule-too-ideal/">40-30-20-10 rule</a>. But then I realized that I wanted to use the idea but customize it a little bit more for my needs.</p> <p>But enough about the details. On to my point.</p> <p>So I am working on Budse by myself. I started the project, and it has been a one-man show the whole time. As an individual developer working on an open source project, sometimes I dream. I start to think big about people actually using it. Big dreams, I know. Haha currently I doubt it if anyone aside from me uses it. When I was coding and especially when I was deciding on how to license it, I thought that since it fulfilled my need it would be useful to other people as well. Maybe that’s not true. Maybe it is. It remains to be seen.</p> <p>It is so easy to dream of becoming great. But maybe dreaming big isn’t such a bad thing. Maybe if I lost the ability to dream big, I would lose a little bit of who I am. So while I am currently unsatisfied with its use, I am definitely going to press forward!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/what-is-marriage/"> What Is Marriage? </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 11</span> <blockquote> <p>They’re pretty much married already. What’s the difference?</p> <p>former co-worker about an unmarried couple living together</p> </blockquote> <p>What is the difference, really? That is, I have an idea of what the difference is. To me there <strong>is</strong> a difference between marriage and just living together. In fact there is a difference between marriage and any other state that one can be in (e.g., single, friends, partners)!</p> <p>But to the rest of the world, it seems like marriage is only an extra special promise to be faithful. And legal rights and benefits. Really, that’s all it is to a large part of the world? “I do. I definitely promise not to be unfaithful to you. You have my word.”</p> <p>It seems like people wouldn’t try so hard to fight for it if that’s what it is to them.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/now-a-little-fish/"> Now A Little Fish </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 3</span> <p>I used to be<br/> One of the few.<br/> Now I am just<br/> One of thousands.
