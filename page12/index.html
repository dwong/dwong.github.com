taking them).  I played with the idea of watermarks for awhile, but I eventually settled on just including something small.  In any case, we’ll see how this goes since it seems as if the blogging has

Friendship </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 11</span> <p>I like having friends.  They usually share some connection with you and are able to share in experiences with you.  Laughter, excitement, and life all happen when friends are around.</p> <p>But something that I am continuing to learn is that friendships will change.  As in, you will change.  Or the friend(s) will change.  Or circumstances will change.  Maybe you just stopped trying.  Maybe they slighted you in some way.  All of this adds up to your friendship changing.</p> <p>So apparently I am much worse than I thought I would be at maintaining friendships.  People have come and gone in my life.  Some have left a mark (and amusingly many have not).  Many are now gone.</p> <p>Now looking back on times long gone, I realize how difficult it would have been to predict how my life would have turned out.  Even if things had been planned or more effort would have been invested, I know that it would have been quite difficult to overcome what has turned out to be the biggest reason for all of the change: <strong>life</strong>.</p> <p>Proofreading this post I have come to the conclusion that this could have been written by a lovesick high school kid secretly talking about some girl he had a crush on who just stopped talking to him even though all indications were that she liked him.  Not that I have that experience, I’m just saying.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-path-more-easily-chosen/"> The Path More Easily Chosen </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 2</span> <p>Nowadays it is all the rage to get medical help to correct our weight loss.  From the LAP-BAND to gastric bypass to diet drugs, we as a society are looking for a way to get rid of those extra pounds hanging on our bodies.  I am not sure if I am just blessed to be able to do things that others cannot or if I really am seeing with clear vision, but it seems that people could do with choosing to do things correctly (albeit with more difficulty).  That is, they should diet and exercise instead of going for the quick fix.</p> <p>It seems strange to me that the LAP-BAND will compare itself to diet and exercise by saying that diet and exercise do not work because people fail.  While I am sure that is true, that is not a particular reason why the LAP-BAND is better since that comparison is effectively saying that it is better for a person if they cannot choose to do something themselves.  On the other hand I think that people need to make that choice.  With freedom they have a responsibility to live with their choices.  I would not want another person telling me what I can and cannot do.  The most marked change is the one that comes from within when they <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/476/having-the-desire/">have the desire for change</a>.  They need to want it so badly that they actually get out and do something to enact that change.</p> <p>The part that amazes me so much (and which is the impetus for this post) is that people who do end up getting medical help take pride in that.  How can you be proud that you resorted to get surgery to get skinnier??  Absurdity of absurdities!  Can you be <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/229/proud-of-nothing/">proud of things that you have no control over</a>?  Well…apparently people are.  Still, the fact that people are will always boggle my mind.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/paying-for-software/"> Paying For Software </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 16</span> <p>I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> so it is no surprise that I use and advocate it when I can.  I would not consider myself <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/10/fanaticism/">fanatical</a> about it (i.e., I will and do use non-free software).  However, in my experience and observation I have noticed how difficult it is for people to pay for software.  How else can you explain how we can pay hundreds to thousands of dollars for a computer only to refuse to pay $20 for a particular desired application?</p> <p>It seems that people are confused about developers, especially those that create free software.  Maybe they do not think that the developers are entitled to compensation because they are releasing free software.  I guess that in part it is due to the difference between the definitions of free (as in zero cost) and free (as in liberty).  Software developers are (surprise!) real people that need to make a living as well.  In a world that contains both free (as in zero cost) and free (as in liberty) software, people need to understand both in order for them to see where the software developer is coming from.  So perhaps we can all remember that paying for software should be seen just like we should view all other purchases - if it satisfies our requirements for purchasing then we should go ahead and do that.</p> <p>All of these words when this abbreviated comic (originally <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/blog/apps">here</a>) says it perhaps even better:</p> <p><img

</div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/self-branding/"> Self Branding </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 2</span> <p>Farmers have used branding for a long time as a way to mark their property, namely their livestock.  They knew that if their livestock wandered off (as they invariably would) then they needed a way to make sure that they had a way to get their property back.  It was a wonderful idea for the farmers.  But what did the livestock think?  I am sure that the livestock were not huge fans of the process.  Having a hot metal brand pressed into their skin was probably not on their list of highlights from their lives.  But they didn’t have a choice.</p> <p><a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/179/applegeeks-coachgirls/">Apple stickers</a> on cars, Gucci emblems on purses (<a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/70/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/">real or fake</a>), and perhaps even soccer jerseys with their large corporate sponsorship logos are all things that seem to follow this idea.  It’s a strange idea really because we are paying companies so that we can advertise for them.  If I walked up to you and asked if you would pay me money in order to wear a necklace with my name on it you would think that I am crazy.  Is the idea that we would pay to display companies’ logos that far off from this example?</p> <p>Nowadays people have a choice.  And I am always surprised when people choose self-branding.  Instead of viewing it as branding, though, they want to display an affiliation, love the cachet/exclusivity, or perhaps just do it because others do it also.</p> <p>In truth, we all do it to some degree.  We buy T-shirts, computers, and cars that all have logos on them.  So I would doubt very much if anyone is exempt.  But thinking about it sure does make one think.  And it sure does give me a different perspective of “brand” names.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older"
