Of course people nowadays want there to be no judgments whatsoever. And let’s be honest, that doesn’t really make any sense at all. It makes about as much sense as getting rid of the court system, doesn’t it?</p> <p>Well I saw something today, and it is a case that definitely makes me think about some judgment passing.</p> <p>Now far be it from me to know if someone actually understands what it means to be a Christian. But I have to wonder about it when I see a sign on the street that proclaims that they should come to church in order to win a car. They direct you to their website where they have <a href="http://www.ineedarevolution.com/easter/">a page dedicated to their contest</a>.</p> <p>To me, that seems outlandish where they feel that they have a need to offer people physical prizes in order to attract them to come to their church. Some out there will say that it’s a good thing to get people into church no matter how they got there. But is that really the right attitude?</p> <p>Seems ridiculous to me, and I hope that this is not a growing trend.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-right-leader/"> The Right Leader </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 31</span> <p>While watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0325710/">The Last Samurai</a> again, I realized some interesting things. Although Tom Cruise is fairly crazy as of late, this was definitely a good movie. In this viewing anyways, I thought that it was insightful to see a leader who was willing to join in on the fight. Contrast this with the leadership style of being perfectly willing to direct form the rear.</p> <p>In that final scene where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsumoto">Katsumoto</a> (loosely based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigo_Takamori">Saigo Takamori</a>) and Nathan Algren (played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>) lead the final charge against the Imperial Army, you see the contrasting styles where Katsumoto and Algren ride their horses through the enemy while Omura (played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masato_Harada">Masato Harada</a>) stands on the hill helplessly trying to yell out orders for the gunmen to shoot their weapons. If not for the superior (albeit seemingly cheating) technology that the Imperial Army had, all of the honor rode with the samurai.</p> <p>Life has its share of similar incidents. There are those people who are willing to get down and dirty versus those who love to direct others. It’s the basic difference in thinking between those that want something done and those that will just go do it. Now this is probably a slightly unfair description of the situation because I think that I tend to be of the latter variety most of the time. And obviously <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/">I must think that I am right</a> about it. But objectively, those of the other mindset will think that people like me rush into things too quickly and act too impulsively sometimes. This is all true, but I digress. (Read <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/">this entry</a> to learn more about what I think)</p> <p>Now what does this mean?</p> <blockquote> <p>If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself</p> </blockquote> <p>That’s definitely an often heard phrase, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true.</p> <p>Lead by example, not by dictation. Try it and you will find a spirit of self-reliance that you didn’t think possible. And that is a good thing.</p> <p>On another note: after a nice reprieve from the world as I know it, I’m back rested and with a little tan. :)</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/tenable/"> Tenable </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 26</span> <p>[<strong>ten</strong>-uh-buh l]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>To be capable of being held or defended</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>That bunker over there is on higher ground, has a good vantage point of the attackers, and is thus definitely tenable.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>This word can be used both as meaning to hold an actual place, but more commonly in our day and age it can be used to describe a side of an argument.

You’re taking it easy for about 5 minutes as you release your body’s waste. Then you look over. There’s another stall next to you. You look down. Lo and behold! What do you see? A piece of dental floss! “Well that’s strange,” you think. What could dental floss possibly be doing in the bathroom. Now there are a few possibilities:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Someone was flossing while they were sitting on the toilet. After finished with it, they just dropped it on the ground.</p> </li> <li> <p>Somehow there was some dental floss in some guy’s pocket and it came out as he was dropping them to sit on the toilet. He had gone outside to take a “floss break”</p> </li> <li> <p>They were in his underwear because he keeps some dental floss there “just in case” (what that case is where he needs dental floss in his underwear is beyond the scope of this entry)</p> </li> <li> <p>He ate some dental floss and it had come out the other end. How did it get on the floor without stains? Once again, beyond the scope of this entry.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dental floss is raining from the bathroom ceiling</p> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/hello-statistics-how-are-you/"> Hello Statistics, How Are You? </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 21</span> <p>So I’ve been using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">feedburner</a> for stats on my website lately. It’s just a little bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Javascript</a> added to the templates. Pretty simple. Except it wasn’t working today! It kept showing 0 visitors when I know for SURE that there were visitors (like me!). What’s going on??</p> <p>Of course <a href="http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427">Kiki</a> noticed that my theme had changed to the default earlier this morning. I’m not sure what was going on, but it might perhaps be related to that? Anyways the change caused me to look for something else out there that could help me out. I’ve used <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com">site meter</a> before but I don’t like how there’s a little icon when you add the code to your page (although now that I think about it, I realize that I know a lot more about HTML and Javascript now compared to when I added that code to <a href="http://www.xanga.com/keleka">my xanga</a> so I could easily just remove the image and retain the functionality. But that’s a moot point now).</p> <p>So I found <strong><a href="http://www.statcounter.com">statcounter</a></strong> which seems to work very well. There’s more information gathered and available than at sitemeter and it’s more real-time than feedburner was. So I’m pretty happy with it thus far.</p> <p>To make it even better because there’s apparently <a href="http://citizenk.wordpress.com/wp-plugins/statcounter-for-wordpress/">a sitecounter for wordpress plugin</a>! That’s super! (Note: I had to download <a href="http://download.almaren.ch/view.php?file=/code/wordpress/wp-plugins/statcounter/statcounter.php">the php page</a> itself because the zip file was linked incorrectly, but the installation was the same and went smoothly)</p> <p>So I just thought you’d like to know that you’re being tracked a little bit. Not as if you didn’t expect it.</p> <p>I thought that the “blog” category needed another entry so that the “Rant” category could take a well-deserved break. :D</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page70">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page68">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
