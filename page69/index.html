Obviously sin is a pretty general answer. But without even having to speak on the more heinous things such as actions warranting fines and felonies, we actually see and encounter many things everyday which are not very good at all.</p> <p>Have you ever met someone who simply cares about nothing? What a waste of a life! To simply meander through life without truly being passionate or caring is such a tragedy. To be scared to love simply because one has been hurt, to be scared to take sides simply because one is afraid to be wrong, to be scared of life simply to preserve it. Well those people make me sad. Is there something worse?</p> <p>Well I’m not sure if I would say that it’s “worse,” but it’s definitely pretty high on my list of “bad things.” Now some might disagree and that’s their prerogative.</p> <p><strong>I think that having an opinion (especially a strong one) without any backing is pretty horrendous.</strong></p> <p>I’ve met people that will do this sometimes, but rarely have I truly experienced the full power of this shortcoming. Nonetheless, a glimpse of it is all I need to see that I have a distaste for it.</p> <p>Sure it’s horrible to not feel anything at all. But it seems to me that it’s equally, if not more so, horrible to be swayed this way and that to the extremes without any concrete evidence to back it up.</p> <p>What prompted me to this? Well I’ll be honest and say that sometimes I read other people’s blogs. I also enjoy reading xangas (even though my own is now just an extension of this blog). I have a whole list of “subscriptions” to people that I’ve met over the years. Some of them are friends that I still talk to, while others are not quite as near and dear to my heart anymore. While reading an entry from one of these long-ago acquaintances about <a href="http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/">300</a>, I saw that they made a comment about how stupid it was to have all of these guys dressed how they were with such obscene amounts of computer assistance in making their bodies perfect. Now, being someone who is into “knowing how things work,” I don’t even like how people can assume things about what computers can and cannot do without actually knowing about it (but that’s a topic for another entry). Back to the example. So the reason that reading this entry made me want to write this entry is because I <strong>also</strong> read about <a href="http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=35">the extensive workouts</a> that the actors, stunt doubles, and crew went through before the movie for four months to get the physique that they showed off in the movie.</p> <p>Now what’s the big deal you ask? Well it’s a big deal because it speaks of something deeper! Just like hearing someone who is usually very “good” but will blurt out an expletive in a moment of anger speaks of deeper issues about just how “good” they really are, so also does this strong opinion about the faultiness of the whole production speak of some interesting traits in the opinion-holder. I suggest people do a little research on their own before they speak of things which they have no idea about. Else you will be thought foolish and ignorant by others. And nobody wants to be a fool. And you especially don’t want to be ignorant.</p> <p>This is why I used to get irritated at people on <a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot</a> as well as why I can get irritated listening to IT people sometimes.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/nefarious/"> Nefarious </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 19</span> <p>[ni-<strong>fair</strong>-ee-uh s]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>To be extremely wicked or evil.</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>The nefarious plan to set him up to take the fall for the murder has been going on for ages!</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>I like this word because you can use it for evil! I mean literally. Nefarious is so much more interesting to use than “evil” don’t you think?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/amazing-feats/"> Amazing Feats! </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 19</span> <p>Are you often awed by things that you see? I am. Whether seeing little kids bending and contorting in Chinatown or watching Kobe Bryant do his thing, I try to be amazed.</p> <p>Can I first of all just say that Kobe Bryant is a pretty ridiculous basketball player? For those that don’t follow the National Basketball Association, Kobe scored 65 points on Friday night and 50 points yesterday. So that means in 2 games, Kobe has scored 115 points at the highest professional basketball level. I question whether I’ve scored that many points in games in my entire life combined! Now, if you add in all of the buckets for shooting around, I’m golden. But can you believe this guy? I can’t. Was it a good idea to build the Lakers around him rather than <a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/shaquille_oneal/">Mr. O’Neal</a> ? Well that kind of remains to be seen. But that doesn’t detract from the fact that it’s amazing to watch him make turnaround 3-pointers while double-teamed as the shot clock is winding down and the game is on the line. I had to construct a run-on sentence just to describe the whole scenario!</p> <p>A little girl bending over backwards as only those in the circus can do? Pretty amazing. I don’t understand, sometimes, how others can have a body capable of such strange things. I remember watching <a href="http://www.tv.com/guinness-world-records-primetime/show/10187/summary.html">Guinness World Records</a> and thinking that it was so amazing that there could be people out there that could fit into a tiny box (or whatever the amazing feat of the evening was).</p> <p>And after seeing these amazing things over the weekend, I think:</p> <p><em>I wonder what my most amazing feat will ever be. I wonder if it has already happened. Now that’s a sad thought.</em></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/in-your-own-world/"> In Your Own World </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 16</span> <p>There are many people in your life. Well, I hope that there are some anyways, otherwise you need to stop reading blogs and go make some friends. Anyways, I have a sinking suspicion that what is true for me is true for most people out there. I’d like to think that I’m not completely abnormal.</p> <p>I know that I act differently around different people. Now you must understand, I actually don’t really like it when people are like this. Am I a hypocrite?</p> <p>I’d like to think not, but I’ll leave that issue for another time because I’m sure that I am. No, the issue that I’m talking about is not necessarily hypocrisy so much as it is human nature. There might very well be nobody out there that will act completely the same in front of other people as they would when they’re by themselves. They won’t fart as much, they won’t scratch themselves in the same places, or whatever it may be. Additionally, there aren’t too many people that will completely act the same. They might not be as at ease so they won’t talk as much when they’re around you. I know that this is true for me when I’m around people whom I don’t really know. But this all seems fairly natural.</p> <p>The thing is, I think that it’s hilarious when you get a sneak peak into someone’s life à la <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0120382/">The Truman Show</a>. Do you ever think what your life would look like if there were cameras everywhere and watching you at every moment? That would be such a trip. Makes you re-think how you picked your nose the other day, doesn’t it? Do we resort, then, to stalker tactics? No, we definitely do not. That’s against the law, and I won’t be your friend if you start doing that. Plus, we don’t really need to. People help us out as it is.</p> <p>It’s amusing, but I’ve noticed that Computer Science people in particular are easy to spot lost in their own world. Perhaps it’s because they’re deep thinking about imaginary objects in their object-oriented programming or trying to lay out in their mind their current algorithm. Whatever the case, I’ve seen a few people (at least) who will do something gross. I remember a prime example in one of my classes at <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu">UCSD</a> where a guy would sit in class, play with his ear, and then smell it. Smell it! Now that looks disgusting, but I don’t even know if the guy knew that he was doing this! He was also at the same time seemingly intent on listening to the professor. I never knew this guy, so I actually don’t know if he was listening, but class after class, he’d do the same gross thing with his ear and smelling his fingers. I’d imagine that there was a strong smell too, otherwise why would he smell it?</p> <p>Anther thing that I’ve noticed is that the same thing happens with people in their cars. Apparently because they’re in a (fairly) small, enclosed space, they think that they’re alone. And I must admit that it is very easy to feel that way. Except, of course, there are windows all around you. So people can see whatever you’re doing, whether that be gross, weird, or funny. I like seeing people do these things. It definitely makes me laugh at them. I especially like seeing people dance. I hope that I also make people as amused if they see me. :)</p> <p>So what can we draw from these things? 1) We do not fart as much in front of other people as we do by ourselves. 2) I want to have a real Truman Show for someone, any volunteers? 3) Don’t do something in your car that you don’t mind other people seeing. 4) There are a few strange Computer Science out there. Somewhere. Not here. :D</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/separate-yourself/"> Separate Yourself </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 15</span> <p>A hint for those who are working and find themselves easily distracted. Well I guess a hint for all of us. It’s hard to focus on a single task (such as your current work project) in this multi-tasking day and age. Something that’s helped me to differentiate between the different tasks at hand has been the use of “virtual desktops”. Most people out there (especially if you’re reading this blog) have an idea of what the desktop is. Basically it’s a folder that contains some items and is what you are looking at when there are no windows open. Now most people are very comfortable with the idea of having one of these.</p> <p>But I propose that you start to think about how useful it would be to have <strong>multiple</strong> desktops.</p> <p>“Why would this be useful?” you might ask. Well in the aforementioned problem, we did not have the self-control to stop from occasionally glancing at the news or email and effectively kill our workflow. Whether that means losing your place in your spreadsheet, or forgetting what the current for loop does, or whatever it may be, it’s a hindrance to being all that you can be in the workplace. And that’s not good.</p> <p>So if you place your project on one “desktop” and your other stuff on another “desktop,” you will be able to go to your project and not be as easily distracted! Additionally, something that I have tried and will try to continue to do more of is to “box” my time. That is, I will actually write down times that I am going to be doing this (i.e. an hour for this project). And for that hour, I will try as best as I can to shut out everything else and focus. I will try to drown out the noise with <a href="http://amzn.to/S7ktz5">some cheap ear buds</a> or even put in some ear plugs.</p> <p>Now mind you, this isn’t a solution for your faults. If you still don’t have the self-control to not look at other things, then that’s your problem. And you’ll need other help.</p> <p>Well this idea is definitely on Linux, and you can easily find references to it for both <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> (which I do enjoy using) and <a href="http://kde.org/">KDE</a> (which is nice in a different way). But if you are a fan of something other than these desktop environments (as I suspect that many of my readers are), then you might want to continue reading.</p> <p>On <strong>Windows</strong>, I recently installed <a href="http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/">VirtuWin</a> which has worked out pretty nicely. It’s fairly full-featured, and I can get it pretty much how I want it. Microsoft released their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx">XP Power Toys</a> awhile back that has an application called “Virtual Desktop Manager” that does a similar thing. Unfortunately I thought that it wasn’t very good the one time that I tried it out. So I avoided it on this most recent search.</p> <p>On the <strong>Mac</strong>, you have the excellent <a href="http://virtuedesktops.info/index.php/downloads/">VirtueDesktops</a> which I have used and approve of. Unfortunately the developer for the project has decided to call it quits because the next upcoming release of Mac OS X (dubbed <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/">“Leopard”</a>) includes a feature that is similar enough to VirtueDesktops to discourage a third-party from developing. This feature might be good, it might not be. But you can try out <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/spaces.html">Spaces</a> when Leopard is released sometime this year.</p> <p>All in all, there are many things out there that will accomplish this task for you whatever your computing platform. Remember that the important issue is to become more efficient with your time and minimize interruptions to your workflow.
