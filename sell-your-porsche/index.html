<div class="entry-content"><p>Do you ever encounter during the normal happenings of the day that you see something that strikes you as a little bit odd?  Well this morning I saw just one of those things, and it got me to thinking a little bit.  A dangerous thing sometimes, I know.</p>

<p>I was driving to work this morning, and I saw a Porsche 911 Turbo.  That&#8217;s a pretty nice car, you know?  &#8220;MSRP: $122900&#8221; when I just searched for it just now.  That&#8217;s a pretty hefty amount.  In fact, that&#8217;s a stupendous amount.  It&#8217;s the classic fast, sleek, 2-passenger, mid-life-crisis-that-some-will-admit-but-some-won&#8217;t type of car.</p>

<p>Why did this cause me to think anymore than the next expensive car you might ask?</p>

<p>This one had a whole bunch of anti-Bush bumper stickers on it.</p>

<p>That seemed odd to me because frankly you don&#8217;t really see that.  Well, at least <em>I</em> don&#8217;t see that.  I see old run-down cars with enough stickers on it that you think that&#8217;s the paint job that they ordered.  I see nice cars with not a spot on them, let alone a nasty bumper sticker.  But here was this car with things like &#8220;Obama for president&#8221; and &#8221;<strong>W</strong>orst ever&#8221;.  It seems strange because it seems, based on past experience, that rich people don&#8217;t really express their views like that.  Additionally, the more affluent people (and this is a generalization obviously) tend to be more Republican in nature.  Interesting.  Now just because I don&#8217;t believe that President Bush is the worst president ever (not with the likes of Buchanan, Johnson, and Harding having already served), but that is beside the point.</p>

<p>The points are this:
1) If I wanted your political opinions or stance, I would ask.
2) Don&#8217;t ruin your nice car with gross bumper stickers.</p>

<p>The solutions are simple (corresponding solution to afore-mentioned points):
1) Everyone should put a small &#8220;Y&#8221; or &#8220;N&#8221; on their car in a specified location depending on what the current hot topic of the day is.  This can be organized by some non-profit organization in order for everyone to know what everyone feels if they really want to know.  Marvelous.
2) (directed at the man with the Porsche) Buy yourself an old car to put your bumper stickers on and use the difference to actually do something.  Your bumper stickers do nothing for the world except rile people up and give the bumper sticker manufacturers a larger profit.</p>

<p>Everything seems simple until you take every singe point of view, I guess.  Oh well.</p>
