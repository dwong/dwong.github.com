Even more important than their years (after all <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/03/26/age-its-just-a-number/">age is just a number</a>) is the maturity with which they handle things.</p> <p>So what do people do? They play games. What are games? They are things like:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Girls saying no when they actually mean yes [caption id=”” align=”alignright” width=”160” caption=”Courtesy of Flickr user <em>Karla</em>”]<a href="http://flickr.com/people/karlaklinefelter/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3107/2694426391_2cde29f697_m.jpg" alt="Courtesy of Flickr user *Karla*"/></a>[/caption]</p> </li> <li> <p>Guys not wanting to express how they actually feel because it’s not “manly”</p> </li> <li> <p>Similarly guys pretending to be completely uninterested</p> </li> <li> <p>Girls playing hard to get (when they actually <strong>do</strong> want the pursuer to “catch” them)</p> </li> <li> <p>Both reading into all kinds of actions, lack of actions, subtle tones, sly looks, the way they laugh when you’re around, and all manner of intricacies that I do not have knowledge of</p> </li> <li> <p>A girl leading a guy (or vice versa) to think that a relationship might happen at some future time</p> </li> </ul> <p>When we play these games, it’s all smoke and mirrors. And if the goal of relationships is marriage, then how is that helpful in accomplishing that goal? It’s not.</p> <p>Guys need to ask the girl out, straight up. (I had my fun being sarcastic about it <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/06/04/on-asking-a-girl-out/">On Asking A Girl Out</a> by saying what you should <strong>not</strong> be doing.) But you need to make it crystal clear to her what you want and what you’re doing. Otherwise you’re just beating around the bush and wasting everyone’s time.</p> <p>Girls need to act purposefully. You want him? Go with it if he asks you out. You don’t? Tell him the truth, brutal as it might be. Don’t sugarcoat things because that helps nobody.</p> <p>These things don’t just apply to the chase, do they? I’m not even really sure why they would apply more specifically to guy/girl relationships. All I know is that I see it there more often. However, these thoughts and their ramifications could be generalized to cover any type of relationship with anyone.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/xkcd-imposter/"> xkcd: Imposter </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 18</span> <p><a href="http://xkcd.com">xkcd</a> is a webcomic that I know and love.

And while I am not ever going to be a hyper-miler, I can at least do as well as I can. (It’s hard to get superb gas mileage when you drive a truck.)</p> <p>While I do drive a less than ideal automobile, I am still able to get 20 MPG. And that might not sound too impressive to most people, but for trucks that’s not bad. But besides that, the tips are still good. They’re by no means new, though. But I didn’t just read it on some other site and paste them here. And remember, sometimes it’s just fine to be <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/07/02/coming-up-with-it-yourself/">Coming Up With It Yourself</a>.

Some of the other tips could also be generalized to this. Why is braking bad? Well every moment of braking is a moment where energy that was expended by gas is being needlessly lost. That is, you get the most use out of your gas when you’re not braking at all because all of the energy from the gas is being used to power the vehicle. And while this is not feasible with the traffic laws that we have, it’s still a true fact.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Coast Into Red Lights</strong> - When you see a red light up ahead, don’t continue with your foot on the accelerator! Why are you in a rush to sit at a red light? Instead, take it easy on the accelerator and ride out your momentum.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cruise Control Is Your Friend</strong> - For periods of driving that are going to be stop-free, utilize that cruise control. The car will consistently apply gas to continue at the speed that the cruise control is set at. And the car will probably do it better than your attempts at keeping your foot steady.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Coast Down Hills</strong> - Gravity will accelerate your vehicle down the hill. So put your transmission into neutral (this is more normal with a manual transmission) and let gravity work its magic.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Turn Off The Car</strong> - Instead of idling, turn the car off when you know that you’re going to be sitting for awhile. While most modern cars are not built to constantly be turned on and off (like at every red light), it’s probably best to turn it off if you’re waiting for someone to run into the store.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Proper Maintenance</strong> - It’s hard to do your best when your vehicle isn’t up to snuff. So keep up with those oil changes, regularly inflate those tires, and make sure everything is as the manufacturer intended.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Slow Down</strong> - Probably one of the most important, this has numerous benefits besides gas savings including (but not limited to) overall safety.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These seem simple enough. An added bonus for doing all of this is decreased road rage. You’ll care more about what’s going on with you and your vehicle than you will about how that jerk cut you off. Save a headache, save some money.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-majority-will-discriminate/"> The Majority Will Discriminate </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 10</span> <p>Discrimination isn’t great. That much is obvious to most people.</p> <p>Isn’t it strange, then, that it seems like most people will indeed discriminate against others if they are in the majority? That is, people that might be discriminated against for whatever reason in one location will discriminate others when they’re somewhere else.</p> <p>What is within man that we do such things? Is it egocentricity? Original sin?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/coming-up-with-it-yourself/"> Coming Up With It Yourself </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 2</span> <p>Have you ever realized that there are so many things that you do <em>not</em> know? I mean, even besides the things that humanity doesn’t know (e.g. the cure to any of a whole slew of diseases, the details of all of the other planets and galaxies, where Amelia Earhart is), there are things that you just don’t know like how to program a complex program, how DNA works, how to create a bookcase from a tree, how to cook a perfect turkey for Thanksgiving, and the list goes on endlessly.</p> <p>So in life, we’re always learning. You’ve probably heard that it’s pretty good for you to learn something new everyday. And I concur, that’s a great thing. Having an open mind, being amazed, willing to be taught. It’s all swell!</p> <p>I’m interested, though, in how there are differences to learning. There is the kind that we learn because someone has taught us (i.e. in the classroom setting at school), but there is also the learning that comes out of a totally different intelligence/mind set. While the former is good, I’m apt to think that the latter is even better.</p> <p>Newton, Socrates, Einstein among a few all had to come up with things on their own. They used logic, research, and intuition to arrive at the results that we now know all about today. And while there are many things that have been figured out already, it’s still pretty good for someone to separately arrive at the correct solution without having been taught it explicitly. At least I think so.</p> <p>So do you know anyone that solved the Rubik’s cube without looking at the answer? Yeah me neither. Give the people that figure it out on their own their due.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page35">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page33">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
