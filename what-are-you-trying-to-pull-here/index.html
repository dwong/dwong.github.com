<div class="entry-content"><p>I went to Marie Callender&#8217;s in order to get a pie (<a href="http://www.mcpies.com/our_food/featured_pie.php">they&#8217;re on sale</a>) a few days ago.  Specifically I went to go get a Double Cream Blueberry.</p>

<p>As I was walking out of the house I made sure that I had enough money, and I also grabbed a handful of coins off of my bookcase because I was running low in my car.  So I get to Marie Callender&#8217;s and order my pie.  Since I had a tin (they require a 50 cent deposit on them to make sure that people bring &#8216;em back) the cost was $6.99.  I looked in my wallet, and I saw that I had one each of $20, $10, $5, and $1 bills.  Sweet!  So I grabbed the $5 and the $1 bills and started rummaging in the handful of change that I grabbed out of my car as I was getting out.  I saw that I had 3 quarters, 3 dimes, a nickel and 3 pennies.  (On another note, is it sad that I still remember all of this a few days later?)  Sweet again!  I can make over 99 cents with the coins that I had so I didn&#8217;t have to get more change.</p>

<p>The cashier starts looking at the coins (understandable since she needs to count it out), and she starts to mildly protest.  I wonder what&#8217;s up, and she asks me what &#8220;this&#8221; is?  She&#8217;s holding up one of the quarters.  And&#8230;it&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_yuan">Chinese coin</a>.  Oh my, I am slightly embarrassed.  Then I realize that I&#8217;m going to have to take <strong>all</strong> of the money back since I couldn&#8217;t make another 25 cents.  Haha I felt pretty silly having to take it back and give over the $10 bill.  Thankfully the cashier didn&#8217;t seem to mind too much.  She did make a comment that it was Japanese or something, to which I mumbled, &#8220;Er yeah something like that.&#8221;  I was too sheepish to correct her.</p>

<p>The whole time after that I was thinking that she might have thought, &#8220;What is this Asian guy pulling here?&#8221;  So Marie Callender&#8217;s cashier, if you&#8217;re reading this, it was an honest mistake.  I wasn&#8217;t trying to cheat.  It&#8217;s also kind of unrelated, but I&#8217;m really not that Asian that I usually carry around Asian currency with me.</p>
