Specifically I went to go get a Double Cream Blueberry.</p> <p>As I was walking out of the house I made sure that I had enough money, and I also grabbed a handful of coins off of my bookcase because I was running low in my car. So I get to Marie Callender’s and order my pie. Since I had a tin (they require a 50 cent deposit on them to make sure that people bring ‘em back) the cost was $6.99. I looked in my wallet, and I saw that I had one each of $20, $10, $5, and $1 bills. Sweet! So I grabbed the $5 and the $1 bills and started rummaging in the handful of change that I grabbed out of my car as I was getting out. I saw that I had 3 quarters, 3 dimes, a nickel and 3 pennies. (On another note, is it sad that I still remember all of this a few days later?) Sweet again! I can make over 99 cents with the coins that I had so I didn’t have to get more change.</p> <p>The cashier starts looking at the coins (understandable since she needs to count it out), and she starts to mildly protest. I wonder what’s up, and she asks me what “this” is? She’s holding up one of the quarters. And…it’s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_yuan">Chinese coin</a>. Oh my, I am slightly embarrassed. Then I realize that I’m going to have to take <strong>all</strong> of the money back since I couldn’t make another 25 cents. Haha I felt pretty silly having to take it back and give over the $10 bill. Thankfully the cashier didn’t seem to mind too much. She did make a comment that it was Japanese or something, to which I mumbled, “Er yeah something like that.” I was too sheepish to correct her.</p> <p>The whole time after that I was thinking that she might have thought, “What is this Asian guy pulling here?” So Marie Callender’s cashier, if you’re reading this, it was an honest mistake. I wasn’t trying to cheat. It’s also kind of unrelated, but I’m really not that Asian that I usually carry around Asian currency with me.</p> </div> <section> <h1>Comments</h1> <div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </section> <div class="related"> <h2>Related Posts</h2> <ul class="related-posts"> <li> <h3> <a href="/cry-room-culture/"> Cry Room Culture <small>May 5</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/the-bear-was-that-baby-on-the-plane/"> The Bear Was THAT Baby On The Plane <small>Apr 12</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/sickness-strikes-again/"> Sickness Strikes Again <small>Feb 19</small> </a> </h3> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/embed.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
