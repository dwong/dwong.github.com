<div class="entry-content"><p>So this past weekend, I got the privilege of being in a wedding party for the first time.  And I must say, it was quite nice!</p>

<p>I wanted to write this down partly for myself, just so that I can remember it all.</p>

<p>Starting the day before the rehearsal some of the groomsmen hung out with Daniel, the groom.  It wasn&#8217;t too outrageous at all.</p>

<p>Then the day of the rehearsal (the day before the actual wedding) was quite busy.  Rental car, drove up ~60 miles to the church (in LA) for the rehearsal.  Got there in time (even with workday traffic).  Fun rehearsal!  For some reason it seemed pretty amusing.  (Oh and I might have tested out the sanctuary to see how my laugh would echo.  And other people might have told me to not dare laugh the day of the wedding.  :P)  Rehearsal lunch.  Food was good, and the conversation was fairly flowing.  Hotel.  The hotel messed up.  Unhappiness.  Ah oh well.  Go-karts.  Better at it than I thought.  (I guess that even though I can rant <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/27/on-driving/">On Driving</a>, I might very well have an aggressive driver in me!)  Got 2nd out of our group (thanks a lot Mike haha).  Hm where is my trophy?
Dinner with Daniel&#8217;s family.  Late, but it worked out.  Sat with some of his extended family and another groomsman.  Got to hear about New Mexican food and their amazing miracle chili sauce.  (I&#8217;ve never tried it, but I&#8217;d be very willing at this point!)  Hotel.  Get ready for sleep.  Gifts from groom.  Talk.  Sleep.</p>

<p>Up at 6:30 AM (it was a 10:30 AM wedding) to get ready.  Out of the hotel by 8 AM.  Do random stuff at the church and sit around looking good for a couple of hours.  Walk down the aisle.  Stand.  Stand.  Feet hurt.  Stand.  And done!  Get out of there, help with more random stuff.  Reception.  Kiss kiss.  See old friends from college.  Nice.  Good lunch.  Real nice.  Slideshow.  Oh sweet they put me in it more than once.  Drive back down to pick up my car from the groom&#8217;s place, and that&#8217;s a wrap!</p>

<p>I enjoyed my time being a part of their wedding.  I&#8217;m glad that I at least got to be in one!  Haha I think that I&#8217;m probably good in terms of wedding experiences.  That is I don&#8217;t need to be a part of another one.  Except as groom.  That&#8217;s one experience that I&#8217;m pretty positive that I want!</p>
