<div class="entry-content"><p>So I just finished traveling for work.  It was quite an interesting experience.  First of all, I&rsquo;ve not traveled for work before.  Secondly, it was supremely interesting getting to watch this whole slew of people that I would not normally get to watch.</p>

<p>People watching was probably one of the more interesting things that I got to do.</p>

<h5>Why do we like to watch people?</h5>

<p>I&rsquo;m of the mind that we (well at least I) like to watch people because we are interested in the human experience.  Well that and because very often it&rsquo;s pretty amusing.  Or perhaps at the very heart of the matter, we like to see how we stack up against everyone else that&rsquo;s around.  Sometimes they&rsquo;re stranger, sometimes they&rsquo;re scarier, and sometimes they&rsquo;re just like us.  Alright they&rsquo;re never just like us.  We wouldn&rsquo;t ever want to admit as much anyways.</p>

<p>People are interesting.  Even the boring ones.  Because the boring ones are very interesting when they don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re being watched.</p>

<h5>Benefits of people watching</h5>

<ol>
<li><h6>Laughter</h6></li>
</ol>


<p>You gotta hand it to people, they&rsquo;ll do some ridiculously hilarious things when they&rsquo;re unaware that they&rsquo;re being watched</p>

<ol>
<li><h6>Entertainment</h6></li>
</ol>


<p>Just because you forgot your electronic device or book, you&rsquo;ll still have something to do.  Almost no matter where are (unless you live as a hermit in which case this post is not for you).</p>

<ol>
<li><h6>Learn</h6></li>
</ol>


<p>Other people have had different experiences in their lives.  Perhaps watching them will teach you lessons about how you can be a better person.</p>

<ol>
<li><h6>Smile</h6></li>
</ol>


<p>Catch those &ldquo;cute&rdquo; moments that nobody was supposed to see.  You know, that darling thing that a child did or that self-sacrificing act that someone does for another.  It&rsquo;ll brighten your day and maybe next time you&rsquo;ll be the one who puts a smile on somebody else&rsquo;s slightly-creepy-people-watching face. :)</p>

<ol>
<li><h6>Help</h6></li>
</ol>


<p>If you&rsquo;re not aware or watching, someone could need your help and you would have never known.  If you&rsquo;re people watching, you&rsquo;re (by definition) aware of your surroundings.  So that makes it easier if you see someone getting hurt or in need of your assistence because you&rsquo;ll see the need and lend a hand, won&rsquo;t you?  Let&rsquo;s hope so!</p>

<p>People watching is a great thing to do.  And it&rsquo;s even more fun to do when you are surrounded by people that you would not normally be around (as I was this past weekend for my work conference).  I didn&rsquo;t know the vast majority of them, but I still enjoyed getting to watch them.  I got to see how they interacted, I got to laugh at humorous things that I saw, and I got to amuse myself even  (hopefully nobody really noticed me doing so).</p>
