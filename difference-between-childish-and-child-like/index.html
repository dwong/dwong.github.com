<div class="entry-content"><p>I, for one, am very amused by children.  Of course, I&#8217;m also amused by a lot of other things.  So I guess simply because I&#8217;m amused by something doesn&#8217;t make it noteworthy.  And yet here I go writing about what I&#8217;m amused by.</p>

<h5>Child-Like</h5>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3077/2588771033_77f03b9201_o.jpg" alt="child-like" /><em>Courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/people/kristi-san/">Kristi-san</a></em></p>

<p>With children, I think that I can break down my amusement to the fact that they are new to the world.  They haven&#8217;t lived in society for the years and years that adults have.  (Of course, that relates to <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/06/11/oh-youre-wrong-it-manners/#comment-14747">this comment</a> on a previous post.)  So for lack of all of those years of social influence, they are new to the world.  They aren&#8217;t jaded because everything is fresh.  The ocean is huge, the mountains so tall, and everything is worthy of a question.  And in addition to that, they are much more free about doing and saying things.  That is, they aren&#8217;t inhibited because they don&#8217;t even know that they should be inhibited.  So they&#8217;ll run and have fun, pick their nose when they feel a booger, and say what they think about people.  Even when it&#8217;s inappropriate.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m amused by all of this, it&#8217;s also likely because I don&#8217;t have to deal with my own children.  Because&#8230;I don&#8217;t have any.  Yet.  Haha but really I&#8217;m positive that it can get old to parents when their kid(s) are acting up endlessly.  Oh boy I can&#8217;t even imagine!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3134/2588771103_dc3d32bf09_o.jpg" alt="childish" /><em>Courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/people/63031528@N00/">blondie478</a></em></p>

<h5>Childish</h5>

<p>And while I enjoy this child-like charm, (as the title suggests) I don&#8217;t actually like it when people are acting childish.  What&#8217;s the difference?  Well in my terms, childish usually applies to those traits of children that are very undesirable.  I think of things like throwing temper tantrums, being self-centered, not knowing when to be serious, and other such pleasant attributes.  And while children obviously do this, I think that I&#8217;m even more turned off when I see it in people that should know better: adults.</p>

<p>In them, I find it to be such a turn-off.  And I&#8217;m not just talking about in girls.  When I meet a guy that acts childish, I&#8217;m almost immediately turned off to ever wanting to be friends with him. Childishness just shows (to me) a lack of maturity that is more and more exaggerated the more I&#8217;d expect them to be mature.  They say that with age comes wisdom, but that, unfortunately, isn&#8217;t true for everyone.</p>

<p>So it all comes down to this: I want to continually be child-like and grow to never be childish!</p>
