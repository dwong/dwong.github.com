They take us to far away lands and on many adventures. They stimulate the mind and imagination to explore things that have been or things that could be. But alas they are a dying form of entertainment it seems.</p> <p>Even with the advent of the digital book reader (such as the <a href="http://amzn.to/Nxod9r">Amazon Kindle</a>), many people are moving towards more quickly gratifying forms of entertainment. We want games immediately on our iPhone (even if it gives us <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/710/iphone-attention-deficit/">ADD</a>), we don’t want to waste a moment of possible entertainment so we watch videos in our cars, and we maintain the convenient connection with people through Facebook and <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/83/tweedle-dee-twitter-dumb/">Twittter</a> rather than actually interacting with them face-to-face.</p> <p>Now it seems that lately people are progressing even further. Many people cannot even walk around without rocking some tunes. They do this when they’re by themselves, with their family, or even with their friends! While this seems to be more prevalent with teenagers, I have seen it with others as well. Is it the incessant need to be entertained? Is it the desire to shut out the world to live in one’s own fantasy? I daresay that while these might be true, it is actually because everyone simply wants to be the hero!</p> <p>Movies always have a soundtrack, and it is especially apparent during the monumental scenes. What kind of a movie would it be if there was not music playing as the hero rescues the captive while avoiding 2 dragons, 10 soldiers, and a huge boulder?! The music helps the audience experience the emotion and excitement.</p> <p>So kids these days. They should be commended. They just want to be the hero and do good in the world. Or maybe they just need a jolt of extra emotion in their lives, which is probably good because many accuse them of a lack of passion. In any case, maybe we should all just give a kid with headphones on a high five.</p> <p><em>Unless, of course, they’re playing the villain’s track.</em></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/bag-of-crap/"> Bag Of Crap </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Dec 21</span> <p>Check out my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woot#Bag_of_Crap">bandolier of carrots</a>:</p> <p><a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5169/5279014335_33ce24c054_b.jpg"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5169/5279014335_33ce24c054_z.jpg" alt=""/></a></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/crispy-is-great/"> Crispy Is Great </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Dec 6</span> <p>Crispy. Yeah that’s something that I can work with. I have started to enjoy photographing food. Possibly because I enjoy food, and I want to in some way remember the experience of good food. So while I will not ever be able to share the taste and smells of the food, I can at least share the visuals. Sometimes the food looks even better in the photos than in real life!</p> <div class="galleria"> <a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5242/5233215293_74aef6d90d_b.jpg"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5242/5233215293_74aef6d90d.jpg" data-description="I do indeed like that bacon."/></a> <a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5087/5233215271_c828aafc0a_b.jpg"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5087/5233215271_c828aafc0a.jpg"/></a> <a href="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5130/5233215229_1e6a4a846a_b.jpg"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5130/5233215229_1e6a4a846a.jpg" data-description="A Hawaiian roll with some honey with some bacon.

That is not surprising. But it is surprising when Crom is loud in the bathroom because I am of a particular opinion that most people try to be discrete there. And he can do this no matter what he is doing in the bathroom.</p> <p>He will walk in loudly as if he is in a rush. He whistles and hums.</p> <p>As he is urinating it is as if he is using all of his might to expel the liquid from his system. Oddly enough, it seems as if there is air in the line since it will go full force then halt entirely then back to full force. Even more odd is the fact that I have always thought that going full force (as he does) would result in more splash-back (if you know what I mean). After expelling the liquid, he seems to like to let out a loud sigh of relief. The sound makes me think that he is being intimate with the urinal. That is just the sound that I want to be hearing from him. Ew. Just ew. After that I sometimes <em>very</em> unfortunately do <strong>not</strong> hear the sound of the faucet. Quadruple ew.</p> <p>Now on the other hand, there are times when he poops. I mean, <a href="http://amzn.to/Rs69nc">everyone does</a>. And those times are pretty loud as well. But that’s because he pushes that stuff out of his butt with as much force as he can. At least that’s what it seems like! I can also discern that there is no toilet seat cover or toilet paper used to cover the seat. Good thing he washes his hands after using the stall.</p> <p>Welcome to the bathroom world of Crom. It is a very unpleasant place for the rest of us. He probably does not know about <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/176/on-bathroom-behavior/">some of my opinions about the bathroom</a>.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/experience-required/"> Experience Required </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Oct 16</span> <p>You might be surprised to know that I actually know that I do not know everything. People who personally interact with me sure are. Even more likely, they flat out refuse to believe it.</p> <p>But I am confident that I am not delusional. I know that I do not know everything. So yes, I am confident when I think that I know something (<a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/5/algorithm-for-your-life/">as most people are</a>), but I also have seen enough to know that there is a vast amount of things that I have no idea about.</p> <p>When I was learning how to drive, I did not give too much credit to my parents when they told me that experience matters in determining how good of a driver I was. I thought that as long as I knew and followed the correct procedures, I would be just fine. But I was wrong. Surprise, surprise; experience really does matter.</p> <p>Having the chance to actually see and try things for yourself is priceless. There is absolutely no substitute for experience. It gives you a warranted confidence that you know and can handle whatever it is that you are doing again. Experience involves getting up close and personal with tasks. You get to see (and hopefully get through) hiccups. You get to see the whole process through to the end and learn lessons from first-hand knowledge.</p> <p>So when someone is giving me <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/781/unsolicited-advice/">unsolicited advice</a> about a project or task, my immediate response is needing to know whether they have actually done it themselves. I do not want to know if they understand what to do, have seen it done by someone else, or have read manuals about it. I want to know if that adviser has actually done it. If so, they have some credibility in my mind. If not, their words might as well be “Wah wah wah.”</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page16">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page14">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
