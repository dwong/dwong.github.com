  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I am happy about the fact that I have become someone who questions a lot of what I hear, I readily admit that we all need to live using assumptions.  We do not check every fact each and every time otherwise we would go insane!  We sit on chairs without checking that the legs will support our weight (although sometimes the chair unfortunately does not support our weight).  We figure that our car engine is going to work even though we don&rsquo;t check it before turning it on everyday.  Staplers have staples, light switches will turn on lights, and our e-mail is accessible.  These assumptions are slight and imperceptible things that we do.  When the assumption does not hold, it is quickly discarded to handle the exceptional case.</p>

<p>But then there assumptions that have a more costly result.  When you and your teammate assume that the other is going to catch the fly ball, you could lose the game.  Perhaps you and another drive make an assumption that the other is going to get out of the way and an accident occurs.  At work, if no definitive statement is made about who is to carry out a task then all involved will think that the other is doing it.  Or in the tragedy of <a href="http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/scraig/gansberg.html">Kitty Genovese</a> everyone assumes that someone else will do the right thing.  Or infinitely increasing in the depth of tragedy, what happens to someone who assumes that scientists and public opinion are correct enough that Jesus is <em>not</em> the answer?</p>

<p>Let us not assume!  Especially when it comes to the important things.  Else we are complicit in the outcome, whatever that might be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While there are many advances in mobile technology, there is none more prominent (nowadays anyways) than the Apple iPhone.  Subsequent to its release in June 2007, it has made a definite mark on society.  It has created huge lines, buzz in media, envy in people&rsquo;s eyes, and a huge increase in revenue for the companies involved.  Despite <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/165/why-hype-up-the-iphone/">much hype</a> and doubt, it has been a game-changing device for the smartphone world.</p>

<p>It has a user interface that is the standard to which all others are (now) compared, it is sleek, it is expensive enough to stay out of the hands of the less privileged (like <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/179/applegeeks-coachgirls/">Coach purses for girls</a>), and it has an entire <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/10/fanaticism/">fanatical subculture</a> to support it. There are some people who use it for its useful features, others who just want it so that they can be hip with the times, and others who will probably say that it’s an essential part of their life.</p>

<p>The thing is, I think that we need to help these people. Their iPhones are taking over their lives. Here we thought that Attention-Deficit Disorder (although this has been replaced by Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in psychology as of DSM-IV, but I could not apply the hyperactivity to iPhone users) was something that we could treat. Unfortunately it seems like we are inducing it in people. And while I am talking specifically about the iPhone, the general principle still stands that people are getting worse at maintaining their concentration on tasks at hand. They have instant messaging that they’re always connected to, text messages that encourage deplorable grammar, and the ever annoying Twitter (<a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/83/tweedle-dee-twitter-dumb/">dumb as far back as 2007</a>), which combines all of these things at one time.</p>

<p>Most people with iPhones seem to have an incessant need to check them. People need to stop this. They need to start living lives that do not involve the Internet. Let us move onward from our digital slavery!</p>

<p>I am slightly amused that I am writing such a thing for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hello this is a blog, which is an entirely digital medium.</li>
<li>I am in front of a computer at least 8 hours a day as a <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/about/">software engineer</a>.  Usually more like 10, including off hours personal time.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nobody likes to pay for health services.  And health services are not perfect at all.  They (medical professionals) charge more than what seems reasonable, and they do not seem to have to answer to anybody except for the health insurance companies because they only listen to the money.  It would be nice to have personal doctors and nurses to tend to your every whim.  And it would be nice if you did not have to pay anything for it.</p>

<p>But this is not how the world works.  For one, medical professionals are people as well.  I am talking about doctors, not the rank and file like staff and assistants.  These are individuals who have gone to school, invested hours and nights to their profession.  (Well at least I hope that they have.  The ones that have not are not ones that I would ever want to go to.)  Their work is indeed important, and it is at times worth the cost.</p>

<p>People sometimes claim that a single entity watching over the entire operation here in the United States will be more efficient.  More efficient?  Since when did a government project ever win awards for efficiency??  Yeah that&rsquo;s a pretty crazy <a href="http://docs.house.gov/gopleader/House-Democrats-Health-Plan.pdf">health plan chart</a>, isn&rsquo;t it?  It is only a guess at what the new health government would look like, but it sure is a scary one.</p>

<p>If everyone has access to all of the doctors, people are going to take as much as they can.  Do you think that you will get to pay the best doctor what he/she is charging?  Well when everything costs the same for everyone it just logically follows that the best doctors are going to be as busy as people can schedule appointments.  People dismiss the supposed &ldquo;death panels&rdquo; that will decide on life and death decisions for everyone, but if there is a shortage of supply (doctors) compared to the increase in demand (patients) then some of those patients will have to be left out.  There is just no possible other way for that outcome to be different.</p>
