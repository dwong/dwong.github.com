And now I’m even less of a fan since it’s blatently against the law (whereas before it was just selfish to put others at risk). They definitely don’t drive as well, and that is a problem if I am driving near them.</p> <p>What if I see a police officer talking on their cell phone? Yeah, that’s another layer on top of that! They’re supposed to be working, and I am fairly confident in my ability to say that they’re not talking about work on their cell phone. They are also not doing their job as well. And that affects me just as much as it affects you.</p> <p>Nobody thinks that police are perfect. In fact they do all types of blatent things. They speed (even when not purposefully chasing someone), they are sympathetic, patronizing, power hungry, and on occasion corrupt.</p> <p>Well these are happy thoughts! I should have taken a picture of the officer and put her on blast. Hm on second thought, people with guns and power aren’t people that I want to annoy too much.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/diy-camera-bag/"> DIY Camera Bag </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 15</span> <p>So I recently purchased a Canon 40D. And there is a whole world of accessories out there. For the first couple of weeks I was keeping my camera in a FedEx bag because it is:</p> <ol> <li>inconspicuous</li> <li>cheap</li> <li>slightly padded</li> <li>water resistant</li> </ol> <p>That seems like a pretty good list to me! But alas I knew that it could not last. Unfortunately, bags (from companies that market them as camera bags) are fairly overpriced. Okay they’re not terribly expensive compared to the actual camera, but I rather enjoyed some of the unique aspects of my FedEx bag. I wanted to keep most of its positive attributes without having to bear the shame of actually holding a FedEx bag all of the time. Here is my bag.</p> <p>First I got:</p> <ol> <li>a canvas bag from my local Army/Navy military surplus store, which was a lot less rugged than I would have imagined</li> <li>craft foam and ripstop nylon fabric from JoAnn Fabric and Crafts (the higher quality foam that I wanted to buy online had an unfortunately prohibitive shipping cost that was higher than the foam itself)</li> <li>cardboard from a shipping box that I already had</li> <li>my sewing machine (which isn’t actually mine and which I had never used before this project)</li> <li>velcro with adhesive backing (I already had this)</li> </ol> <p><img width="500" title="Raw goods after purchase" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2637/3722068453_2f366f6cb5.jpg"/></p> <p>My idea was to create my own padded inserts to put into the canvas bag. I was going to use the craft foam as the filler, cardboard to stiffen the insert, and the nylon to wrap the whole deal. I made a number of inserts, and each of them had a similar method of creation.</p> <p>I guess that I didn’t take any pictures of my initial steps, but all I did was measure and cut the desired size of foam, cardboard, and nylon. I cut enough nylon to wrap the foam and cardboard like a present.</p> <p>Next I pinned the fabric according to how tight I wanted it to be around the foam. I generally was going for pretty tight because I thought that it would give it a more professional appearance. For the most part I think that was correct because I saw other examples of loosely wrapped inserts that people made online that did not look as nice.</p> <p><img width="500" title="Pinned fabric ready to be sewn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3419/3722886662_1141e0ac2c.jpg"/></p> <p>I inserted the foam and cardboard into the sewn nylon. This was actually one of the most difficult steps because the nylon was getting sewn with the intent of there being a tight fit. And a tight fit it was! I was able to eventually get all of them into their nylon sleeves, but some of them were quite difficult.</p> <p><img width="500" title="Foam going into the nylon" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3722072177_0c660c2227.jpg"/></p> <p>I then closed up the nylon and pinned it so that I could hand stitch it.</p> <p><img width="500" title="Pinned nylon ready for hand stitching" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3482/3722071175_766ef3f6af.jpg"/></p> <p>I used (or tried to use) a hidden stitch when I was hand stitching.</p> <p><img width="500" title="Hand sewn and completed foam insert" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2547/3722884054_56a8d4374e.jpg"/></p> <p>So I repeated that process a number of times so that I could have the appropriate number of bag inserts.</p> <p><img width="500" title="All of the completed inserts" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2583/3722887336_b66e28ace6.jpg"/></p> <p>My final step was to attach some velcro so that the pieces would hold their form. I’m still working on this step, though, because I have since found that the adhesive on the velcro is insufficient to keep the velcro on the nylon. I am pretty sure that using some kind of glue (maybe even fabric or super) will do the trick.</p> <p><img width="500" title="All of the materials completed!" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3472/3722888066_c450201797.jpg"/></p> <p><img width="500" title="Here's my camera bag" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3722257961_dcabf8cafd.jpg"/></p> <p>It’s fairly inconspicuous, modestly priced (total for everything is under $50 compared to over $100 for the bags that I wanted, and I have leftover material), padded, and now I have skills that I didn’t have before!</p> <p>Of course, if after reading this you decide that it’s still not worth it to sew all of the inserts yourself then you could just buy a commercial camera bag insert like <a href="http://amzn.to/P6vRtH">this one</a>, and put it into whatever bag you want.</p> <p>Inspiration came from: - <a href="http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Make_a_Stealth_Camera_Bag">Wired - How To Make A Stealth Camera Bag</a> - <a href="http://www.the3dstudio.com/blog_detail.aspx?id=640">Make Your Own Customized Camera Bag</a></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/barefoot-running/"> Barefoot Running </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 10</span> <p>That title probably gets your attention. As is common knowledge, we need shoes in order to run. Running barefoot is impossible to comprehend. Except…it’s not. There are so many reasons that I have found that compel me to run barefoot. And I figured that now would be a good time to post them here.</p> <p>I have been running barefoot for over 9 months now. I started off running a few blocks, and I have progressed to now run a few miles a couple of times each week. Yes, it will sometimes be briefly uncomfortable when I step on a pebble, but it is usually gone in the next step. However for most people the thought of pain is enough to prevent them from ever trying to run barefoot. On the other hand, just because I run on the street does not mean that everyone has to. <img style="float:right;" width="240" title="Yep, they're mine" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2554/3706453438_b247aaa513_m.jpg"/> Running on sand or grass would definitely be more comfortable, but it’s really not that bad running on the pavement (in my opinion). I believe that running barefoot is better, and I want my behavior to be in accordance with my beliefs.</p> <ul> <li>I was <strong>not born</strong> with shoes. (Of course I also wasn’t born with clothes, but clothes don’t injure me. If they did, I wouldn’t wear those either.)</li> <li><strong>Injuries increase with the price</strong> of the shoes according to surveys from runners.</li> <li>It’s recommended (by pediatricians) that <strong>young children be allowed to walk around barefoot</strong> so that they can develop their feet. There must be something there, right?</li> <li>By the laws of <strong>physics</strong> the force of each step when running has to be translated and absorved somewhere. Running sure isn’t hurting your feet. Where does that leave? Perhaps the knees and hips?</li> <li>Tough and hardened feet are much more <strong>useful</strong> than soft tender feet. Soft feet are nice to the touch, but they can’t nearly do what used feet can do. If you had to run away from danger, you can’t exactly stop to put on your shoes.</li> <li>Without the artificial support of shoes, your feet need to balance and adapt. That is, the <strong>muscles and tendons in your feet will get stronger</strong>. It’s similar to why it’s excellent to do exercises without artificial support. You need to balance while also performing the task at hand. And that will make you stronger and strengthen the entire structure.</li> <li>There sure are a lot of people from <strong>other countries</strong> that are awesome runners without the need for shoes. Have you ever thought about that? Not only are they awesome, but they have lower incidence of injury. Just because I wasn’t born in a culture like that does not mean that I cannot become like that!</li> <li>I stand for <strong>freedom</strong>!. I always have, I always will. But it is a different kind of freedom that I feel when I’m running barefoot. It kind of makes me feel like a little kid, and I love that.</li> <li>The arch is one of the strongest structures known to man. We use it for bridges to hold up amazing amounts of weight. Have you ever seen an arched bridge have something filling the entire arch? No. That’s because the <strong>arch is strongest when there is nothing filling that gap</strong>. Surprise, surprise guess where we have an arch.</li> <li>One of the most important reason to consider running barefoot is that it makes you more <strong>conscious of your running form</strong>. So while your form might suffer when you’re running with shod feet, you won’t modify your behavior because it doesn’t manifest itself until years of running have beaten your body down. However you will definitely notice the difference with bare feet. You will not strike your heel. You will land on the balls of your feet. You will be careful of where you go. You could learn how to run with better form from someone teaching you. But that doesn’t mean that you’re necessarily going to change. Pain is a much better way to modify your behavior than mere information. It’s a reminder every step that you need to run correctly.</li> </ul> <p>I run barefoot.

It is looking very likely that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE55T7E120090630">California will have to issue IOUs</a> as the new fiscal year rolls around. How did we get into this pickle? The recession! The decreased revenue from falling property taxes and lack of state income taxes from those who are not working has left the Golden State in a huge predicament. $24.3 BILLION?? That is ridiculous.</p> <p>In the special election on May 19, 2009, the people of this state voted against the increased taxes that were proposed. I am a fairly modest supporter of our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Governator</a> as he is standing against the tide. I agree with his observation that the people of California are sick and tired of living in the most taxed state of the United States of America! Even though he has not always been my favorite politician (really who is?), I am glad that he is attempting to stand for what he thinks that the people want.</p> <p>Democratic state politicians on the other hard are, inexplicably, ridiculous. While they, too, are trying to stand for what they think that the people want, they are doing it in a way that is illogical. From trying to find loopholes to pass the budget with a simple majority (since they can’t pass what they want without Republican support) to trying to pass tax increases along with budget cuts, they are not making the process extremely difficult. They are still trying to get theirs while seeming to not understand what basic tasks they need to do in order to get the state’s finances in order.</p> <p>Let us put it simply: California <strong>needs</strong> to cut its costs. It doesn’t have the money and at this point it is not reasonable to increase the taxes that it imposes on its population. At some point people are going to get tired of paying so much for the privilege of wonderful weather (and horrible smog). I wonder if the politicians know this. Maybe good old Mr. Olympia himself knows.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/pay-me-in-silence/"> Pay Me In Silence </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 25</span> <p>Silence is golden at the movies. How much is it worth everywhere else? It’s usually trouble to dispense knowledge and wisdom to everyone around.</p> <p>People don’t like to be told what to do. Have you ever noticed that it is sometimes harder to tell those that are close to you about something compared to telling those that are not as close? Why is it that a close friend or family member can tell you something that will cause a negative knee-jerk reaction when the same opinion from a perceived detached and objective party will be received well?</p> <p>It seems to me like part of wisdom is knowing when to be quiet and give others a chance to succeed. Surprise, surprise maybe other people don’t want me to solve all of their problems, even if I could. Perhaps maybe a little more love in all things, without which I am nothing even if I am the wisest person in the world.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page23">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page21">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
