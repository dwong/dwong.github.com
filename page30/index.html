What’s the secret to finding out what they’re really like?</p> <p>A box. Yes, put them into a box. Of course, most of us don’t want to be put into a box because we feel that it inhibits who we are. We don’t want others to define us. And that makes sense.</p> <p>But I’m talking about a metal box. In fact it’s a metal box that rolls around. And when you put someone inside you get to see their rage, impatience, and overall self-centered nature. It’s like releasing The Incredible Hulk, without all of that gamma mess. It really is pretty shocking.</p> <p>When you use the box, you will get to see how people love to do things for themselves. In particular, they like to cut in line. Can you imagine if they did that to you while waiting in line at the bank? Perhaps when the teller says, “Next,” they will jump the line and just go up. What kind of an uproar would that cause? I’m pretty sure they’d meet with some fairly vocal outrage. But in the metal box? It all comes out.</p> <p>I <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/">love</a> <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/27/on-driving/">writing</a> about this. That’s what happens when you see it everyday!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/dance-circles/"> Dance Circles </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Dec 3</span> <p>When you’re out and about, you might happen upon people that are moving to sound. Yes yes, in life you might see dancing. Whether in the club or at an organized school dance or at a wedding or in your house, dancing has a way of getting to people. Some more than others.</p> <p>Is it just me or does it always seem like people like to develop into circles when they’re dancing in groups? And where there is a circle, there will eventually be someone in the mush pot. It also seems like there is a particular type of person that always ends up in the middle. Maybe they like the attention. Maybe they’re trying to impress a special someone. Or maybe they just love a little space while they’re busting their moves. Everyone who’s not in the circle? I think that they like the circles because they can be entertained without having to actually dance.</p> <p>Me? I say no to circles! Fun for all!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/yellow-mellow/"> Yellow Mellow </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Nov 26</span> <p>Aren’t bathrooms full of such interesting happenings?</p> <p>In the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290002/">Meet the Fockers</a> as Bernie Focker is giving everyone a tour of their house, he eventually gets to the bathroom. When he’s there, he tells them the rule of the house is</p> <blockquote> <p>If it’s yellow let it mellow, if it’s brown flush it down. -Bernie Focker</p> </blockquote> <p>I think that I’m working with someone who has taken that to heart.</p> <p>No, scratch that. Some of them don’t even flush it down. Decency people, decency!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/wedding-daze/"> Wedding Daze </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Nov 24</span> <p>Man oh man. In the last 2 and a half years since I’ve finished college, there have been all kinds of weddings going on. Just the ones that I’ve been to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Johann Wendy</p> </li> <li> <p>Van Melissa</p> </li> <li> <p>Matthew Kristen</p> </li> <li> <p>Peter Kelly</p> </li> <li> <p>David Lusye</p> </li> <li> <p>Ben Noelle</p> </li> <li> <p>Daniel Stacey</p> </li> <li> <p>Jeremy Serena</p> </li> <li> <p>Daniel Jenn</p> </li> <li> <p>Dustin Valene</p> </li> <li> <p>Mike Judy</p> </li> <li> <p>Micah ChristiE</p> </li> <li> <p>Garron Cynthia</p> </li> <li> <p>Andy Robin</p> </li> <li> <p>A relative wedding, neither of whom I would recognize</p> </li> </ul> <p>And besides that there have been other weddings of people that I know. Too much marriage. :P</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/doing-it-on-my-own/"> Doing It On My Own </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Nov 12</span> <p>Nobody is born with the ability to do everything. Somehow we have to learn things. Even when we are talented at something, we still need to actually learn it before our talent can manifest itself.</p> <p>When I was learning how to drive a manual transmission, I got to go out with other people as I learned the basics of how it worked. But trying things out every couple of weeks could only get me so far. It was only when I got my own vehicle and had the chance to go out by myself that I started to work things out. Sure I failed. Sometimes miserably so. I can still remember some of those violent stalls where it felt as if the automobile body was going to separate from the wheels. But eventually it came together.</p> <p>I’ve learned that while it’s easy to dictate (or be dictated to), it’s much better to give people the opportunity to shine. In other words, teaching a man to fish means sometimes the man doesn’t catch a thing. But he will.</p> <p>Or…he’ll starve. In which case, I don’t know because the illustration doesn’t really cover that scenario.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page31">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page29">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
