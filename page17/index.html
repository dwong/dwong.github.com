      <span class="post-date">Dec 22</span>

      <p>Growing up, I heard the children’s rhyme:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was assumed that this saying would protect us from other people’s mean words.  And when you’re a young child, it is easy to trick yourself into believing it.</p>

<p>But then you get older and you realize the truth.  Words are, in fact, more powerful than physical pain.  Physical pain definitely has its place.  Broken bones, strained joints, diseases, and so on are all painful and uncomfortable (to say the least) to go through.  But all of that pales in comparison to the effect that words and emotional trauma can have.</p>

<p>While it’s rather debatable what can hurt a person more, it is pretty easy to see how emotional trauma can scar people for life.  The life of a child who has verbally abusive parents can be negatively impacted for good even with counseling.  While I do not want to undermine the damage that physical pain can have, the emotional pain is the one that I have seen with my own eyes because it happens all of the time.  One can toil for great lengths of time over something, and sometimes it seems like it takes only a single word to make all of that labor futile.  Words get at us even through our armor and shields.  They needle their way through kinks and prick us to death.  And the worst part of all is that it is the words of those closest to us that hurt the most.  Well maybe even worse than that is the fact that we are all so horrible in regards to how we use our words.</p>

<p>The tongue: so mighty and so horrible.  No one can tame it, but we must try, eh?</p>

          The Government Union
	</a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">Dec 12</span>

      <p>I have frequently heard people advocating government jobs.  That is, the people that I know will talk about how good it is to be a government employee.  They talk about the pension, benefits, and job security, to name a few.  All of these things are true.  But just as the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/519/unions-will-get-you-for-sure/">unions</a> will get you in the private sector, so also will the unions affect the public sector.  Sometimes the unions in the government are organized, but one could make a case for the entire federal government being one gigantic union that stands against their employer (aka the American people).</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-12-10-federal-pay-salaries_N.htm">USA Today article</a>, we find out that things are in fact not too good.  People are being paid quite a bit nowadays, don’t you think?  It is especially interesting that there has been such a boom in government increases during the same time as the private sector losing so many jobs.  And by interesting I mean awfully disturbing.  The government is becoming a behemoth that is going to continue growing until it collapses and knocks down the support columns that hold up this house.</p>

<p>The thing that I do not understand in the least is how people in government positions can work without the fear of being fired!  Whether incompetent or able, they will keep their job (unless perhaps they are grossly ill-performing where even then it will take quite some effort to make a move on them).  So when people are presented with the option to try their best or do as little as possible with both seeming to result in the same outcome, what would people do?  Exactly, they would do the least possible.  There is no incentive for people in government jobs to continue to do their best.  Now you see what I am saying about the government employees being similar to a union.</p>

<p>Just as the unions have been able to cripple portions of the private sector (such as the American automakers), it is going to be the government employees that are going to bring down the government.  If you have not read what unions can do to the world, I suggest that you read the ever popular <em><a href="http://amzn.to/PuUYqb">Atlas Shrugged</a></em> by Ayn Rand.</p>

<p>All of the signs are there.  <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/675/health-care-reform/">Health care reform</a> that will dictate much more than we need or want it to, a growing government influence in our lives, a government that dictates what companies will do (since it owns them), perhaps even the degradation of freedoms to which we are rightly entitled to under the Constitution.  This is something that concerns all of us, and we all need to care about it.  Because we sure are going to have the live with the consequences together.  And disregarding warning is a terribly foolhardy thing to do.</p>

          Clueless Spokesmen
	</a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">Dec  3</span>

      <p>When there is a disaster happening, the affected agencies always seem to appoint a spokesman.  And that spokesman always seems to have no idea what is going on.  Is it really that hard to have a spokesman with a little bit of knowledge?</p>

<p>I am rather tired of hearing the endless stream of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I do not have that information”</li>
  <li>“We are not aware of that at this time”</li>
  <li>“I cannot say whether that is true or not”</li>
  <li>“I do not know the answer to that”</li>
  <li>“We have not heard of that rumor”</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not understand any of the people that are involved in putting these spokesmen out there!</p>

<p>If you are the agency or group that is being spoken for, I would think that you want to seem competent.  You want to put out someone who is excellent because they are going to be the face of your group.  You do not get that if you present someone who cannot even answer the questions that they field.</p>

<p>If you are the person who is to be the spokesman, I would also think that you would want to be knowledgeable of everything that you are supposed to know.  Otherwise, as so often happens, you will get roasted by the questions that the audience has.  They are going to ask you about what they have heard and apparently their sources are better than yours.  So you will sound clueless and lost.  Who wants that to be them?</p>

<p>And me?  Yeah I just want someone who will give some answers.  I can get tired real quickly of hearing people avoid the questions that they just don’t know the answers to.  No, lame answers are not better than no answers.</p>

<p>On another note, salesmen are just specialized spokesmen that are trying to get your money.  Time to get those salesmen up to speed on what they’re selling, huh?</p>
