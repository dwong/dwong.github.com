<div class="entry-content"><p>So I recently purchased a Canon 40D. And there is a whole world of accessories out there. For the first couple of weeks I was keeping my camera in a FedEx bag because it is:</p>

<ol>
<li>inconspicuous</li>
<li>cheap</li>
<li>slightly padded</li>
<li>water resistant</li>
</ol>


<p>That seems like a pretty good list to me! But alas I knew that it could not last. Unfortunately, bags (from companies that market them as camera bags) are fairly overpriced. Okay they&rsquo;re not terribly expensive compared to the actual camera, but I rather enjoyed some of the unique aspects of my FedEx bag. I wanted to keep most of its positive attributes without having to bear the shame of actually holding a FedEx bag all of the time. Here is my bag.</p>

<p>First I got:</p>

<ol>
<li>a canvas bag from my local Army/Navy military surplus store, which was a lot less rugged than I would have imagined</li>
<li>craft foam and ripstop nylon fabric from JoAnn Fabric and Crafts (the higher quality foam that I wanted to buy online had an unfortunately prohibitive shipping cost that was higher than the foam itself)</li>
<li>cardboard from a shipping box that I already had</li>
<li>my sewing machine (which isn&rsquo;t actually mine and which I had never used before this project)</li>
<li>velcro with adhesive backing (I already had this)</li>
</ol>


<p><img width="500" title="Raw goods after purchase" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2637/3722068453_2f366f6cb5.jpg"/></p>

<p>My idea was to create my own padded inserts to put into the canvas bag. I was going to use the craft foam as the filler, cardboard to stiffen the insert, and the nylon to wrap the whole deal. I made a number of inserts, and each of them had a similar method of creation.</p>

<p>I guess that I didn&rsquo;t take any pictures of my initial steps, but all I did was measure and cut the desired size of foam, cardboard, and nylon. I cut enough nylon to wrap the foam and cardboard like a present.</p>

<p>Next I pinned the fabric according to how tight I wanted it to be around the foam. I generally was going for pretty tight because I thought that it would give it a more professional appearance. For the most part I think that was correct because I saw other examples of loosely wrapped inserts that people made online that did not look as nice.</p>

<p><img width="500" title="Pinned fabric ready to be sewn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3419/3722886662_1141e0ac2c.jpg" /></p>

<p>I inserted the foam and cardboard into the sewn nylon. This was actually one of the most difficult steps because the nylon was getting sewn with the intent of there being a tight fit. And a tight fit it was! I was able to eventually get all of them into their nylon sleeves, but some of them were quite difficult.</p>

<p><img width="500" title="Foam going into the nylon" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3722072177_0c660c2227.jpg" /></p>

<p>I then closed up the nylon and pinned it so that I could hand stitch it.</p>

<p><img width="500" title="Pinned nylon ready for hand stitching" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3482/3722071175_766ef3f6af.jpg" /></p>

<p>I used (or tried to use) a hidden stitch when I was hand stitching.</p>

<p><img width="500" title="Hand sewn and completed foam insert" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2547/3722884054_56a8d4374e.jpg" /></p>

<p>So I repeated that process a number of times so that I could have the appropriate number of bag inserts.</p>

<p><img width="500" title="All of the completed inserts" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2583/3722887336_b66e28ace6.jpg" /></p>

<p>My final step was to attach some velcro so that the pieces would hold their form. I&rsquo;m still working on this step, though, because I have since found that the adhesive on the velcro is insufficient to keep the velcro on the nylon. I am pretty sure that using some kind of glue (maybe even fabric or super) will do the trick.</p>

<p><img width="500" title="All of the materials completed!" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3472/3722888066_c450201797.jpg" /></p>

<p><img width="500" title="Here's my camera bag" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3722257961_dcabf8cafd.jpg" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fairly inconspicuous, modestly priced (total for everything is under $50 compared to over $100 for the bags that I wanted, and I have leftover material), padded, and now I have skills that I didn&rsquo;t have before!</p>

<p>Of course, if after reading this you decide that it&rsquo;s still not worth it to sew all of the inserts yourself then you could just buy a commercial camera bag insert like <a href="http://amzn.to/P6vRtH">this one</a>, and put it into whatever bag you want.</p>

<p>Inspiration came from:
