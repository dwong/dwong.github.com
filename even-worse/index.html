<div class="entry-content"><p>You know, there are a lot of things that are &#8220;bad&#8221; in this world.  Obviously sin is a pretty general answer.  But without even having to speak on the more heinous things such as actions warranting fines and felonies, we actually see and encounter many things everyday which are not very good at all.</p>

<p>Have you ever met someone who simply cares about nothing?  What a waste of a life!  To simply meander through life without truly being passionate or caring is such a tragedy.  To be scared to love simply because one has been hurt, to be scared to take sides simply because one is afraid to be wrong, to be scared of life simply to preserve it.  Well those people make me sad.  Is there something worse?</p>

<p>Well I&#8217;m not sure if I would say that it&#8217;s &#8220;worse,&#8221; but it&#8217;s definitely pretty high on my list of &#8220;bad things.&#8221;  Now some might disagree and that&#8217;s their prerogative.</p>

<p><strong>I think that having an opinion (especially a strong one) without any backing is pretty horrendous.</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve met people that will do this sometimes, but rarely have I truly experienced the full power of this shortcoming.  Nonetheless, a glimpse of it is all I need to see that I have a distaste for it.</p>

<p>Sure it&#8217;s horrible to not feel anything at all.  But it seems to me that it&#8217;s equally, if not more so, horrible to be swayed this way and that to the extremes without any concrete evidence to back it up.</p>

<p>What prompted me to this?  Well I&#8217;ll be honest and say that sometimes I read other people&#8217;s blogs.  I also enjoy reading xangas (even though my own is now just an extension of this blog).  I have a whole list of &#8220;subscriptions&#8221; to people that I&#8217;ve met over the years.  Some of them are friends that I still talk to, while others are not quite as near and dear to my heart anymore.  While reading an entry from one of these long-ago acquaintances about <a href="http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/">300</a>, I saw that they made a comment about how stupid it was to have all of these guys dressed how they were with such obscene amounts of computer assistance in making their bodies perfect.  Now, being someone who is into &#8220;knowing how things work,&#8221; I don&#8217;t even like how people can assume things about what computers can and cannot do without actually knowing about it (but that&#8217;s a topic for another entry).  Back to the example.  So the reason that reading this entry made me want to write this entry is because I <strong>also</strong> read about <a href="http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=35">the extensive workouts</a> that the actors, stunt doubles, and crew went through before the movie for four months to get the physique that they showed off in the movie.</p>

<p>Now what&#8217;s the big deal you ask?  Well it&#8217;s a big deal because it speaks of something deeper!  Just like hearing someone who is usually very &#8220;good&#8221; but will blurt out an expletive in a moment of anger speaks of deeper issues about just how &#8220;good&#8221; they really are, so also does this strong opinion about the faultiness of the whole production speak of some interesting traits in the opinion-holder.  I suggest people do a little research on their own before they speak of things which they have no idea about.  Else you will be thought foolish and ignorant by others.  And nobody wants to be a fool.  And you especially don&#8217;t want to be ignorant.</p>

<p>This is why I used to get irritated at people on <a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot</a> as well as why I can get irritated listening to IT people sometimes.</p>
