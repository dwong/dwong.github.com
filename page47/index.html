That’s the easy stuff. The wrappers, the broken toys, the school work that is no longer pertinent.</p> <p>Then there is the the items that hold significance but are not really too useful. Those are the cherished toys and so on that at one time were loved, but are no longer. These often will get kept for sentimental reason or donated so that another could love it.</p> <p>Along the same vein, there are those items that were very amusing but for a much briefer amount of time than the previous category. In my mind I see the gag gifts, the awards, and the other one-time items that were cherished but for a moment but are now essentially trash.</p> <p>Contrast this with those items that were dearly beloved before but are now regarded with a bit of distaste. Perhaps these are gifts given by an old flame or a long-lost friend. In that moment and for some time afterwards the item was important, but as a result of happenings in your relationship with the other person(s) involved it has changed its meaning.</p> <p>So what is more worthwhile, a piece of (essentially) junk that holds memories of a grand time or an item that is actually useful but holds more bitter memories?</p> <p>I am not one to pack like a rat, but I like to keep special things. I actually think that I would opt to save the latter over the former even though I would enjoy the former more often. The hard things make us who we are, and I like to remember where I came from. The journey is important. What say you?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/first-and-foremost-when-i-blog/"> First And Foremost When I Blog </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 30</span> <p>Web logging. Weblogging. We blogging. Oh yeah we’re blogging!</p> <p>Why do we do it? Why do I do it? It’s such an interesting phenomenon. People have been writing in journals and diaries for years and years. But those always seemed to be meant to be secret. Along come computers and the Internet and all of a sudden there are people who have a desire to write things in a completely public forum. What is the attraction? I know that I have met people who have asked just these questions.</p> <p>So why <em>do</em> I do it? Well I think that a large attraction for me is to be able to freely express myself in whatever way I want. I can say something and not be graded or judged (okay I guess that you could judge me in some ways) based on it. I am able to say what I want when I want. I can rant about the guy that bugs me or I could talk about the small pleasures of life. Some people have their radio shows, others have their newspaper columns. But for the average Joe, what public forum is available to express the joys and outrages of life? Aren’t our opinions as worthy (if not as well voiced) as those more famous opinion expressers?</p> <p>Rory over at <a href="http://cleancutblog.com/">Clean Cut Blog</a> has a <a href="http://cleancutblog.com/group-writing-project-what-is-your-first-rule-of-writing/">Group Writing Project</a> that is intended to allow many people to write about what their absolute first rule of writing is. I was reminded of it after reading Shelly’s post <a href="http://thiseclecticlife.com/2007/07/27/fishing-for-an-audience/">Fishing For An Audience</a>.</p> <p>So after thinking about my reasons for even having a blog, I realize that I’ll only do it when <strong>it is interesting to me</strong>. That seems rather obvious, but it very accurately describes what I do with this blog and why I do what I do. That is why this blog is not like others. Hopefully that is <em>not</em> why it’s not the most popular blog on the Internet. I mean, I’d like to think that what I am interested in has some appeal to other people.</p> <p>Anyways, although there are many many good blogs out there and the popular opinion is that they should focus on a particular area, I think that I like to keep this blog a place where I can show people how I go my own way. You know, the wong way. And each time I write a post, that is what I keep in mind.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/a-37-tv-would-do-quite-nicely-right-here/"> A 37" TV Would Do Quite Nicely Right Here </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 28</span> <p>I definitely enjoy entering contests. I always figure that you only have a chance if you try, right? Well there’s a pretty sweet contest where <a href="http://www.5minutesformom.com/2032/insignia-37inch-flat-panel-lcd-hdtv-contest/">5 Minutes For Mom is giving away a 37” TV</a> (hooked up by <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8274672&amp;type=product&amp;id=1171058029049">Best Buy</a>, thank you very much). All you have to do is leave a comment and create a blog post linking to them. Pretty sweet deal for the person that wins, and it’s a pretty smart move for them in order to get tons of link backs. Everyone wins. Well except for everyone who enters and actually doesn’t get the TV. So actually not too many people “win.” Oh well, I’m just hoping that I’m the one that actually does win!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/nastiness-in-your-mouth/"> Nastiness In Your Mouth </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 25</span> <p>As part of Harry Potter-mania, Jelly Belly held a special promotion of Bertie Bott’s Jelly Beans. My co-worker brought some a couple of bags of them in to work recently and we got the special privilege of getting to try them.</p> <p>These are a special release and as such they have special flavors. Everything from grass to pickle to black pepper and booger. However, none of that can compare to a couple of the ones that I tried.</p> <p>I’d like to think that I’m willing to try many things. I have no desire to try everything once, mind you. I have no desire to try things that might necessarily place my life/freedom/health in jeopardy. But I still fancy myself a bit adventurous, and I’d like to think that I’m willing to try many things.</p> <p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1391/896714327_fc561b0d3c_o.jpg" alt="bertie_botts_flavor_guide"/>So I tried some especially fun flavors such as vomit and sardine. However, by and far the worst flavor that I tried was rotten egg. <strong>Rotten egg</strong>. Who thinks of such things?</p> <p>So my co-workers and I were trying different flavors in the mindset of doing them together. Nobody likes to things alone, and just as I wrote in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/12/im-willing-if-you-are/">I’m Willing If You Are</a> doing things side by side with another peson is an effective psychological tool. So after taking turns at trying different flavors and meeting with relative disgust, we decided to all try the rotten egg flavored jelly bean at once. We each picked out jelly beans according to the guide, but when we tried it we all discovered that we had in fact chosen the much better lemon drop flavor. Then I decided that I only live an earthly life once, so I still tried it even while my co-workers tried other things. And as I slowly chewed and let the saliva transmit the flavor to my taste buds, I began to become quite disgusted. The flavor and the stench conspired to cause me to gag. I coughed a few times, and I must say that I really felt a couple of moments of almost wanting to puke. It was so gross. It’s amusing that it was in fact grosser than the vomit taste itself.</p> <p>Other thoughts:</p> <ul> <li> <p>In any case, I’ve tried it and I don’t intend on trying it ever again. But please, I would be more than happy to have you try it. It’s not as if you have been there and done it. :)</p> </li> <li> <p>I’m really really really really really glad they did not choose to make a jelly bean that was flavored as sour milk. I think that would have guaranteed puking from many adventurous souls.</p> </li> <li> <p>I think that flavor tester for these nasty Bertie Bott’s Jelly Beans has got to be on the list of the worst jobs. Imagine tasting vomit every single day at work. And not just everyday, but constantly. Oh man.</p> </li> <li> <p>That morning of trying nasty tastes was filled with hilarity. Paramount was when an unsuspecting co-worker believed another who said that a jelly bean was an innocuous fruit flavor when it was in fact vomit-flavored.</p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/applegeeks-coachgirls/"> Apple:Geeks :: Coach:Girls </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 22</span> <p>Well first off, it’s not totally all-inclusive and definitive to say that only geeks want Apple computers or that all girls want coach purses. But you know what, for now that will be the title.</p> <p>Secondly I took this idea from those old SAT analogy questions. Sick as it may be, I rather enjoyed the SAT. It was challenging without being impossible. Plus every time I took it (I only took it once “for real”), it was different. Whether that meant different passages to read and answer from or different math questions, I enjoyed that it was a new challenge that I hadn’t exactly encountered yet.</p> <p>Anyways, those were definitely unimportant asides. I really want to just say that I think that Apple is keeping their prices artificially high in order to appeal to a certain part of the market. They want to be the ultimate that everyone desires. They want to be what Coach purses are to girls. Okay okay you can choose any of the myriad of popular expensive brands of purses, but I just needed an example. And that seems to be a popular one nowadays.</p> <p>Coach is a company that produces leather goods and sells them on a very high profit margin. Economists have hypothesized that they are selling “affordable luxury” that is both recognizable as a luxury product while also being reasonably within the budget of many people. That is to say that it’s thought to be “nice” and it’s also well-known to everyone.</p> <p>Apple is the same thing to geeks (and artists and movie makers and perhaps even all computer users).</p> <p>Despite your opinions, I’d say that you must admit that Apple has a well thought-out business model. They customize software (including the operating system) to work very well on their devices. I’m mainly speaking about their computer here rather than their other devices, but I suppose that it holds for those as well. So they are determined to do something and do it well. They will sell very few product lines, and they are not determined to be able to support everything under the sun like Microsoft is with their Windows product. Have you ever thought about how much easier that makes their job? They know exactly what they must do while Microsoft has to build a product that is so good that it can conquer “the unknown.” If Apple were unable to get something to work just right with their goal, they could just say “forget it” and be done with it.</p> <p>And upon this business model, Apple has kept their prices high. They sell good products, but they charge a premium for them as well. And seeing as how they have increased their market share from 3.2% to 7.6% in 3 years (<a href="http://www.macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/apple_mac_grabs_76_home_computer_market_share_iphone_to_sell_100m_per_year/">reference</a>), something is working for them.</p> <p>Personally, I’ve been keeping an eye on the Macbook Pro for the entire time that it’s been out (and probably even as soon as rumors started circulating that it was going to be produced). I was eager to see what Apple was going to do with that platform. I knew that there would be problems with such new technology (and I was proved correct with the plethora of reports from the first few generations but I digress). I do intend to still buy one. But just for curiosity’s sake I recently priced laptops from both Dell and Lenovo. I was able to get hardware that was as good (or better) and at cheaper prices. It was fairly dramatic to say the least.</p> <p>What does that mean? It means that Apple laptops are also “affordable luxury.” It means that you don’t need one. You could get a very usable functioning laptop for thousands less. Or similarly you could use the same amount of money and get a laptop with more cutting edge components. But because Apple keeps their prices high, people will always hold them on a pedestal. They will be the ideal instead of just a choice. And that works out just fine for Apple. But just like I don’t understand the whole deal with buying fancy purses (saying “it’s quality” just doesn’t cut it all of the time), I’m not sure if I’m totally comfortable with Apple all of the time. I think that on a case by case basis I would advise people to honestly figure out what they need. And i think that many times that will lead to the conclusion that Apple is not the place for them. Yeah, if I were a girl I might just be that one with the homemade bag on her shoulder.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page48">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page46">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
