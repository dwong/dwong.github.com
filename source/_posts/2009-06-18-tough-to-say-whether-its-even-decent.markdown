I have been working on a budgeting application called [Budse](http://budse.sourceforge.net/) (actually for quite some time now).  It's a straight forward application that allows you to create a set of accounts that have rules assigned to them, which dictate how to split up whole account deposits (e.g., a paycheck).  I originally had the idea because I wanted to start budgeting using the [40-30-20-10 rule](http://www.goingthewongway.com/199/is-the-40-30-20-10-rule-too-ideal/).  But then I realized that I wanted to use the idea but customize it a little bit more for my needs.

But enough about the details.  On to my point.

So I am working on Budse by myself.  I started the project, and it has been a one-man show the whole time.  As an individual developer working on an open source project, sometimes I dream.  I start to think big about people actually using it.  Big dreams, I know.  Haha currently I doubt it if anyone aside from me uses it.  When I was coding and especially when I was deciding on how to license it, I thought that since it fulfilled my need it would be useful to other people as well.  Maybe that's not true.  Maybe it is.  It remains to be seen.

It is so easy to dream of becoming great.  But maybe dreaming big isn't such a bad thing.  Maybe if I lost the ability to dream big, I would lose a little bit of who I am.  So while I am currently unsatisfied with its use, I am definitely going to press forward!
