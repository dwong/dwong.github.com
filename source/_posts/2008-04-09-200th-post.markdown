So over a year after starting, I'm at 200 posts.  It didn't take too long I guess.  Oh well at least it's not 50 days after starting!

I've gone from posting things that I really wanted to put out there to posting everyday about stupid stuff that I found online to posting once a week some things that I see in life.  And sometimes I even post things that will be useful to someone else.

But one thing is constant, this is **my** blog, and I get to do whatever I want with it!  And I love that!  :D

Still, the fact that I've written that many entries is pretty amazing to me.  Let's not think about how much time was spent writing those things.  Rather, let's enjoy the fact that I have an outlet by which to release my thoughts.  Priceless, I'm sure.
