The truth about the cheaters is that they will get theirs.  And everyone around them will be glad to see it.

Yesterday I read [a blog entry](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html) that got me to thinking.  In summary, that blog entry was about programmers who cannot program to save their life.  They go to interview for a position, but they can't even write a simple program from scratch.  Now having gone through a Computer Science program recently, I can verify that this is something that is likely true.  However, I'm not sure if only 0.5% of the "programmers" out there could write the simple program.  Nevertheless it's true that it I'm outraged at the fact that there are many out there who are not all that they claim to be.  Specifically, someone who has graduated from the same university as me with the same degree is no different on paper.  However I know for a fact that there are many out there who could not program without a book or resources readily at hand.  It's unfortunate that we live in a world such as this.

Truth be told, this affects many things besides the programming world.  Anyone who has ever encountered a cheater has essentially stumbled upon the same idea.  Those who are out to claim that they are something without actually doing something to back it up are far worse than those who claim to have no knowledge.  I don't know if embellishing a resume or trying to save face are necessarily things which will condemn you, but I know that a person who does those things has some character issues that are deep and rooted.  And I don't want to be that person's friend.  Maybe that's motivation, maybe it's not.  Likely it's not.  Whatever the case, I don't like you because your lack of integrity affects us all.  [ Dave Williams](http://www.knx1070.com/pages/3323.php?contentType=4&contentId=94560) sure thought so this morning, and I agree.
