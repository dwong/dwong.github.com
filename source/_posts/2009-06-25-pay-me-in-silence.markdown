Silence is golden at the movies.  How much is it worth everywhere else?  It's usually trouble to dispense knowledge and wisdom to everyone around.

People don't like to be told what to do.  Have you ever noticed that it is sometimes harder to tell those that are close to you about something compared to telling those that are not as close?  Why is it that a close friend or family member can tell you something that will cause a negative knee-jerk reaction when the same opinion from a perceived detached and objective party will be received well?

It seems to me like part of wisdom is knowing when to be quiet and give others a chance to succeed.  Surprise, surprise maybe other people don't want me to solve all of their problems, even if I could.  Perhaps maybe a little more love in all things, without which I am nothing even if I am the wisest person in the world.
