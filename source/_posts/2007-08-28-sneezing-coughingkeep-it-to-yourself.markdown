This past weekend was quite an ordeal.  I saw many instances of disgusting behavior that even more solidified my belief that people are just gross.  Is it because I live in a fastidious society that elevates cleanliness to godliness?  Perhaps it is.  But it doesn't matter because I am still grossed out by others no matter what the reason.

Sneezing is a naturally occurring action.  Our body responds like that because it is trying to rid itself of something that does not belong.  Perhaps it is because we are sick and it's trying to expel some germ-infested mucus.  Or more than likely it is because there is some dust or other foreign particle caught inside of our body.  So the body is doing a great thing when it reacts with a sneeze.  However, there is no need to be at a swap meet and turn to the side to sneeze.  The reason that there is no need for that is because there might be other people standing near there.  And those people might not appreciate your nasty disgusting expelled mucus even close to them.  Thanks.

Coughing is a similarly outstanding action that the body uses to save itself from harm.  It can happen in order to keep the windpipe clear so that we can breathe.  Well I guess it can also happen in order to signal someone about something.  But that is not what I'm thinking of.  I'm thinking of that hacking repeated cough that some are so inclined to do.  You know where you don't do that?  At a buffet.  A place where everyone essentially shares the same food.  You don't cough on your hand.  You know why?  It's because you are going to use that same hand to get your food.  That is sick.  You also do not sneeze all over food.  It doesn't matter if you don't like it.  It doesn't matter what you're doing.  You can feel it (it doesn't sneak up on you) so please just put anything in your hand down so that you can cover up.  That is even more sick!  I hope that you don't know what you are doing and what germs are because if you knew and still did it, you should be so ashamed.

I do not appreciate when people are inconsiderate.  Have you ever noticed how easy it is for us (in general as people) to truly only care about ourselves?  It's our natural carnal tendency, whether you'd like to admit it or not.  Some acknowledge this and try their darnedest to fight it.  Some have been changed.  And some just don't care.  I'd hope that I'm not the latter ranting and raving against my own.  

So next time you cough, sneeze, or in some other way do something that can affect others, think about what you'd want others to do.  And put some hand sanitizer on that mess.
