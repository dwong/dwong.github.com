You know what I'm talking about.  It's that feeling that you get when you do something really hard or super embarrassing.  You know, like when someone catches you dancing when you thought that you were alone or when you ask someone out or peeing in your pants in front of the entire class or saying something stupid that you immediately knew that you should not have said pr maybe you just told someone that you were master of the Earth, stood on a railing on a large ship, spread your arms, and fell overboard.  

You know, it's that embarrassed, how can I live with myself, I can't stop saying "oh my goodness" feeling.  I love it.

I think that I'm a late bloomer because sometimes I act like I'm in junior high.  Haha I love it and hate it all at the same time.

And I'm constantly stuck wondering how in the world people do all of the things that they do when I can't even begin.  It's like everyone else is lifting weights, and I'm still stuck trying to gain admission to the gym.  So I have one question: WHERE DO YOU PAY THE DUES?!
