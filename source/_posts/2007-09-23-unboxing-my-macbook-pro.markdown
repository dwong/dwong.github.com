After following the MacBook Pro's progress from before it even came out to the first edition with its problems aplenty to the future iterations that got better and better, here is the culmination.

I initially started to get interested in the MBP once I realized that Mac OS X was much more than I had thought. It had pieces of BSD (a Unix foundation) and that seemed to me to be worthwhile. I wanted to see what it was like, and the MBP just became more and more attractive as I looked at it more.

Hopefully my waiting will pay off and my MBP will be trouble-free. Now by this time these kinds of things will not be very exciting to most people. there have been countless people who have done such posts and have tread this ground. But that is all by design because I don't want to be one of the first (and almost by definition get all of the problems). In any case, here are the pictures. They're not too interesting, but rest assured that I have some future related posts that may be more so.

It looks so normal!

I'm glad that they make it as shock-resistant as possible.

Goodies, goodies.
