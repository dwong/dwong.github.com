of my own domain.  (where domain is my actual web domain that I just established)

So after much deliberation I have chosen to register my domain (goingthewongway.com) at [namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com).

Benfits of namecheap vs others:




  * include dynamic dns ability even without paying for hosting (vs dyndns charging $25/per for using your own domain)

  * can use paypal

  * pretty cheap (only $7.99 for a year with a coupon)

  * easy to use



The only downside I can see is that they are not accredited with [ICANN](http://www.icann.org) but their parent registrar is.  I have only read good things about them online, and I have found in my brief experience that it is true that they are just dandy.

Other news: updating wordpress is super easy.  Those wordpress people are pretty awesome.  I like their software.

Anyways, I will be creating sub domains in the future for my other applications.  Stay tuned.  Same wong place, same wong channel, blah blah blah.  :D
