Crispy. Yeah that's something that I can work with. I have started to enjoy photographing food. Possibly because I enjoy food, and I want to in some way remember the experience of good food. So while I will not ever be able to share the taste and smells of the food, I can at least share the visuals. Sometimes the food looks even better in the photos than in real life!

I do indeed like that bacon.

Grilled cheese sandwiches are making a comeback. Here it comes back with bacon mixed in.
