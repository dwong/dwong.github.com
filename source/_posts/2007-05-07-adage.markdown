[**ad**-ij]


#### Definition:


Proverb, saying learned by experience



#### Example of usage:


At work when the boss wasn't in, we were all a little less productive.  I guess it's just like the old adage goes, "When the cat is away, the mice will play."



#### Comments:


For some reason whenever I think of this word, I think that the word "old" should be prepended to it.  It's just another way to say "proverb."  Of course that is good because if you're using this word then you probably know some proverb.  And that would mean that you're wise.
