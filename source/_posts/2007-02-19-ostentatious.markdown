[os-ten-**tey**-sh_uh_ s]


#### Definition:


Characterized by intending to impress others with obvious and conspicuous show.



#### Example of usage:


The engagement ring is a significant symbol to people but the 4 carat diamond that she keeps flaunting is simply ostentatious.



#### Comments:


This word is a synonym of "showy" and can be incorporated to more aptly describe someone's behavior rather than saying that they are "showing-off", as is more commonly done.
