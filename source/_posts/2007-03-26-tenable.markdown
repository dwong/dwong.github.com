[**ten**-uh-buh l]


#### Definition:


To be capable of being held or defended



#### Example of usage:


That bunker over there is on higher ground, has a good vantage point of the attackers, and is thus definitely tenable.



#### Comments:


This word can be used both as meaning to hold an actual place, but more commonly in our day and age it can be used to describe a side of an argument.  When someone has a better position in such an argument, their position could be described as tenable.  If you use it, people might nod and agree, but they'll likely have no idea what you're talking about.  Then you'll feel like an all-star.  Unless of course they already know what it means, in which case you better make sure that you're using it in the right context.

Haha I can't believe that I just made up a quote and then quoted myself.  :P
