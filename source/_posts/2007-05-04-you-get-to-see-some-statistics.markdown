So just to let you know, I made a statistics page available for readers to peruse.  It lists general information such as how many posts and how many comments.  The most interesting statistic (in my opinion) is the list of the commentors and how many comments they have left.  However, I must admit that the commenting seems to be fairly unevenly weighted.  Does that make you want to do anything on my posts?  ;-)

In any case, check out the "Statistics" page in the navbar.
