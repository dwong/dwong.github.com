Another year, another jury duty completed.  This time I actually got as far as a courtroom.  I was originally summoned in 2008, but I postponed it so that I could do something for work.  Today it was time to pay the piper.

Jury duty sure seems to happen to me [often](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/24/lovely-civic-duty/) (especially considering you're only allowed to serve once a year)!  Last time I realized that [jury duty is probably a good thing](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/25/jury-duty-is-good/).  And this time?  Well this time I just want to write down and remember that in the future:





  * Don't wear sandals.  I was torn whether to do it today, and I'm glad that I did not because nobody else had them.


  * Bring a jacket, you'll be glad.


  * The juror orientation doesn't start on time.  But don't be that late.  Today I was 30 minutes late, and I got there _just_ before they started.


  * You can bring food, there's even a microwave that can be used.
