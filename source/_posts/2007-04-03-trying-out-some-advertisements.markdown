Now I don't want to be a sneaky bugger (even though some might say that about me anyways), so I will tell you upfront that I'm trying out Google AdSense.

Additionally I have added a site search at the top that will allow you to not only search the web, but it will also allow you to search only my site!  I think that's a fairly useful feature if you were so inclined to wonder about what whether I've written about a certain topic.

Now why would I add these features?  Well I'll also be honest with you about something else.  I actually don't hardly ever click on ads (even the nice text ads that aren't obnoxious).  But I also have realized that they're not too bad to click on.  It doesn't hurt me to look at an advertisement site (especially when it actually **is** related to what I'm looking at).  Anyways so if nothing ever comes of it, then that's fine.  But I figured that I should stop wondering if I could make enough money blogging, and I should just try it out.  Google ads are generally pretty good about finding out about content and delivering meaningful ads.  I can tentatively vouch for that.

Additionally, I have also added a bunch of support buttons to my site.  I think that although they generally detract from the main purpose of the site (which is to post content from my mind), they warrant their place.  Each of these components are either important to the support of this blog or to my personal usage.  They are simply a sign of things that I approve of.  These are totally unrelated to the advertisements that I'm trying out, and all are freely available for you to use.

Feedback on these topics as well as on any other topic on this site is always welcome.
