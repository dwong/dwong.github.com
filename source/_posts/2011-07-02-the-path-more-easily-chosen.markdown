Nowadays it is all the rage to get medical help to correct our weight loss.  From the LAP-BAND to gastric bypass to diet drugs, we as a society are looking for a way to get rid of those extra pounds hanging on our bodies.  I am not sure if I am just blessed to be able to do things that others cannot or if I really am seeing with clear vision, but it seems that people could do with choosing to do things correctly (albeit with more difficulty).  That is, they should diet and exercise instead of going for the quick fix.

It seems strange to me that the LAP-BAND will compare itself to diet and exercise by saying that diet and exercise do not work because people fail.  While I am sure that is true, that is not a particular reason why the LAP-BAND is better since that comparison is effectively saying that it is better for a person if they cannot choose to do something themselves.  On the other hand I think that people need to make that choice.  With freedom they have a responsibility to live with their choices.  I would not want another person telling me what I can and cannot do.  The most marked change is the one that comes from within when they [have the desire for change](http://www.goingthewongway.com/476/having-the-desire/).  They need to want it so badly that they actually get out and do something to enact that change.

The part that amazes me so much (and which is the impetus for this post) is that people who do end up getting medical help take pride in that.  How can you be proud that you resorted to get surgery to get skinnier??  Absurdity of absurdities!  Can you be [proud of things that you have no control over](http://www.goingthewongway.com/229/proud-of-nothing/)?  Well...apparently people are.  Still, the fact that people are will always boggle my mind.
