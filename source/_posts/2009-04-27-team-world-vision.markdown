Finishing a [marathon](http://www.goingthewongway.com/513/marathon/) is pretty good right?  Well what about finishing it and getting to help a worthy cause?  That is even better!  I was talking with a friend today, and she suggested that it would be a good idea to raise money for a charity since I have been doing all of this training already.  After I thought about it, I realized that it made a lot of sense.  People seem to be willing to help out since they can see that it is something that I would care about.

I looked at a number of very worthy charities before I decided that I wanted to be a part of [Team World Vision](http://www.worldvision.org/content.nsf/getinvolved/teamwv).  

From their website:


> World Vision is a Christian humanitarian charity organization dedicated to working with children, families, and their communities worldwide to reach their full potential by tackling the causes of poverty and injustice.



If you are interested in joining with me to donate to a worthy cause, please visit my fundraising page:
