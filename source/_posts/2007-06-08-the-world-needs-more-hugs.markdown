I am a big fan of hugs.  After reading [Are You Afraid Of Hugs](http://qmusings.com/blog/2007/05/27/are-you-afraid-of-hugs/), I went on over to the [Free Hugs Campaign](http://www.freehugscampaign.org/) website and discovered a very interesting story!

A man, feeling alone and disconnected from the world, went out to a local place and offered free hugs with a sign.  Now that seems pretty strange if you think about what you'd feel if you saw someone doing the same.  I know that I would have thought that he was just a creepy guy trying to feel someone up.  But in any case, it turns out that this guy really just wanted to spread the love.  And I think that's an excellent idea!

The world we live in truly is disconnected from each other.  We see hundreds of people everyday, and we don't even bother to greet most of them.  Even with the people that we do know and talk to, between cellular phones, e-mail, and instant messaging, our communication is distant at best.  We don't look people in the eye as often.  And that is just too bad.

Hugs are the antithesis of today's mindset.  That is why the Free Hugs Campaign was so revolutionary.  It totally went against the norm.

In short, I like hugs a lot.  Why?




  1. Receiving a hug gives you a certain feeling of being accepted for who you really are


  2. Giving a hug lets others know that you care about them in a tangible way


  3. Hugs are something that you _could_ do with just about anyone


  4. Hugs are free



Give 'em a chance.  I doubt that you'll regret it.
