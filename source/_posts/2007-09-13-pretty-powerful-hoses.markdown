Firefighters use some pretty powerful hoses.  I know this.  You know this.  But this video that I just saw confirms it.  Firehoses come in different sizes, and I would assume that they're using numerous "Blitz line" (2 1/2 inch) or maybe even 3 inch hoses in order to do this.  10 of 'em work the magic.
