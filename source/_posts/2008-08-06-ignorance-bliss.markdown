People sure seem to like to talk about themselves being ignorant.  But just go and call someone ignorant and see what happens.

I've heard it said that being called ignorant is tops for bad things to be called.  Now whether that is a true statement remains to be seen.  Still it makes me wonder.  Is the saying true?  Is ignorance bliss?

When people talk about ignorance as a blissful state, they are usually talking about the fact that they are unaware of something.  Perhaps it's because they've been caught doing something that they're not supposed to be doing (e.g., breaking the law because they didn't know the law).  Or perhaps it's because it's their last resort reasoning for why they aren't caught up on the facts (e.g., people not up on things like politics).

But it doesn't seem altogether like I have to buy ignorance as an excuse.  Do I really care if someone didn't know that it was illegal to yield to me at a signal when they've just caused an accident?  No, frankly ignorance as an excuse is useless.  Facts are facts.

So is it bliss?  Maybe.  But it sure is an extraordinarily weak argument/excuse/cop-out no matter why you're saying it.
