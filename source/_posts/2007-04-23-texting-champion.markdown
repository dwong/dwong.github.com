I'm not sure how many people text a whole lot.  I'm assuming that there are many of them out there.  Now personally I am not a big fan of it.  Not because it's inconvenient or useless but rather because I don't appreciate getting "nickeled and dimed" (in this case literally).  You might say that's cheap, but that's just the truth.  I don't appreciate paying for the cell phone plan and on top of that getting charged the lousy 10 cents to both send _and_ receive a text message (of course this is more specific to [Verizon](http://www.verizonwireless.com/) than it is to all cellular phone carriers in the United States.  Anyways, enough about my personal feelings about texting.  The real reason that I thought about texting today was because I read about Miss Morga Pozgar who is now the reigning texting champion!

I read about this last night in [an Engadget article](http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/22/morgan-pozgar-wins-texting-championship-for-cheaters/), and I could hardly believe that they even have this competition!  I think that the world is ridiculous because they sponsor such things.  They give money to the person who is the quickest to type out long words.  How can there be many people who would try for such a thing (okay granted I think that if I had known about it then I would try for it and see if I could win $25,000 for doing essentially nothing).  But it's amazing to see the kinds of things that go on in the world out of my eyes.  Utterly amazing.
