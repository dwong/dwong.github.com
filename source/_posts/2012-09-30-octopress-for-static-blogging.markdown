Thank you, [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org).  You were fantastic to me for over 5 years, but I'm moving on to something new.  In efforts to keep things fresh, learn something new, and improve the performance of this blog, I am starting to blog with [Octopress](http://octopress.org), which is a blogging platform built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

The advantages of this system include (but are not limited to):
*It serves static web pages so it's _fast_.
*[GitHub](https://github.com) offers built-in support so my blog is now in proper source control and hosted for free!
*The completed website is generated on my machine and pushed to a webserver so I could easily move webhosts at any time.

Octopress included a pretty decent stylesheet, which made it easy to get set up and writing.  However, I ended up customizing it that my blog would not look like all of the other Octopress-powered websites out there.  Some of the things that I added on top of Octopress were:
*[Sitemap](#sitemap)
*[Atom Feed](#atom)
*[Retaining sidebar collapsed state](#sidebar_state)

<a id="sitemap"></a>Sitemap

<a id="atom"></a>Atom Feed

<a id="sidebar_state"></a>Retaining Sidebar Collapsed State
