When I think of basic rights, there are certain things that come to mind.  There is life, which is the right to not be killed without a just reason.  There is liberty, which allows us to have the freedom to do whatever we want to.  And there is the pursuit of happiness, which allows us the freedom to find the ever elusive happiness (granted of course that this doesn't interfere with others' rights).

In this day and age apparently people's perceptions of human rights are changing.  We are entitled to a good job (even if we do not deserve or cannot do the work), keeping our house (even when we cannot afford it), health care (even though it's an optional service since our right to life is not an entitlement to a set number of years), and [high speed internet](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/10/broadband-access-a-legal-right-in-finland.html).  So while all of these things really deserve their own respective thoughts, I just have to say this: really, high speed internet?  What an entitled and distorted society we live in.
