I saw [this post](http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/30/the-steampunk-mouse-and-the-mouse-mouse/) on [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/), and I thought it suitably disturbing to write a post about it.

Check out the original article that Engadget is just reposting [over here](http://www.instructables.com/id/EM1O9XJF0YPF7M5/) at [Instructables.com](http://www.instructables.com/) (which is a super site with lots of things for those of the DIY variety). There is an instruction video that will let you perform the same modification. However, I think that more people will just be interested in seeing what I'm talking about. So without further ado, here are some pictures!

A glimpse of the parts beforehand. That's nasty.

Here is the finished product after inserting the (computer) mouse into the (real) mouse. Oh yum.

And here it is being used by someone's hand. Who knows who that is. All I know is that I don't want that to be my hand. And I don't want to shake their hand either.


So there have some of the interesting pictures that I saw over at Instructables. That is disgusting, but I think that is still fairly cool. Why is that cool? Well just imagine how much _more_ disgusted everyone else would be if they saw you use it. I could see how this could be the source of many many practical jokes. Find it gross, find it humorous, or find it useful. Whatever the case, it has to evoke some feelings in you.
