I don't like when people use English words or phrases without knowing how to use them.  I started compiling a list after reading some blogs and noticing errors in their English.  And these were not blogs started in foreign countries.  These were supposedly English language based blogs!  In any case, peruse the list and see if you're guilty of any of these mistakes:




  1. **maybe/may be** - _"Maybe" means perhaps while "may be" means could be.  Okay okay I know that using "be" in the definition is not good.  Nevertheless, there is a definite difference between the phrases.  Examples: "Maybe I'll go tonight" vs "She may be going tonight"_


  2. **they're/their/there** - _This difference between words is pretty well-known, and yet it is still often misused.  The first is a contraction of "they are" so you have to be able to substitute "they are everywhere you use "they're."  "Their" is possessive.  "There" indicates location.  Examples: "They're going to eat food" vs "I'm going to eat their food" vs "We are going to eat food there"_


  3. **its/it's** - _This happens so often it's sickening.  Haha I just used "it's."  Anyways "its" is a possessive of a previously mentioned inanimate object while "it's" is a contraction of "it is."  Examples: "Don't judge a book by its cover" vs "Look around the city in the fall and see how it's all changing"_


  4. **site/sight** - _The difference between these words is that "site" means location and "sight" means something that is seen.  Examples: "Why don't we go to the construction site to see how things are going" vs "Boy those fireworks over the water sure are a sight to see."_


  5. **buy/by/bye** - _"Buy" means "to purchase", "by" is a preposition that has a number of meanings including "of or near to" or "through a particular medium", "bye" is either a shortening of the common greeting "goodbye" or the opportunity for a team to not have to play another team in a  sports tournament._



In any case that list is not, by an means, exhaustive.  I think that I actually don't mind it when people know that they are not experts at English.  However, I think that I have the most problem with people when they make it seem as if they have a complete idea of what they're saying.  Such is life, huh?  So try to learn what you can.  Oh and stop by the [Word of the Week](http://www.goingthewongway.com/learn-something/word-of-the-week/) to learn some good vocabulary.
