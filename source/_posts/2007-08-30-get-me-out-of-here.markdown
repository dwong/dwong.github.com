Alright alright, that was a lame title considering what it's about.  This is just to note that I just hacked a couple of my plugins so that they don't display me or my information anymore.  

For example, in the recent comments in the sidebar, it was showing my comments, but I have removed that so that now it will only show comments by people other than me.  

And then for the Stats page that is displayed, I have decided to only let it show information that is unrelated to me.  Hopefully that will give some better statistics for you to see on what is actually popular with other people rather than just with me!
