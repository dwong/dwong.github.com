[pan-**dem**-ik]


#### Definition:


To be widespread or pervasive (often referring to a disease) over a very large area



#### Example of usage:


As the world fell further into turmoil, the already pandemic fear of war grew in intensity.



#### Comments:


Using this word conveys much more meaning than simply using "very widespread" because it it speaks of just how extensive it is.  Often it is used in reference to the entire world because the Greek prefix "pan" actually means "all."
