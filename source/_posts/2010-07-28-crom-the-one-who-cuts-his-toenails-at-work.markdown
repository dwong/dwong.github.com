Snip, snip, snip.  The familiar sound can be heard at my workplace.  Imagine the surprise of myself and my coworkers as we were chatting when we heard it.  The sound is rather unmistakable and usually reserved for the bathroom in one's home.  However, we were actually at work on a weekday.

It came as little surprise to us that Crom would do this.  He is a man of little social reservation.  He is the first to (eagerly) get his food.  He is the first to go back to work so that he can leave earlier (without helping to clean up of course).  He talks (sometimes loudly I might add) on the phone with his girlfriend (as I understand it, it's a long term kind of thing).  Truthfully, I would not be awfully surprised if he picks his nose and eats whatever treasure he finds.

Once you hear your co-worker cutting his toenails at work, all bets are off.
