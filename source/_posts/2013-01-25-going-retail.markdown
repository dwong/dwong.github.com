This blog has not been getting the lovin' that it's due.  It's calling me to utilize it.  It wants it, it needs it!

But that's another story.

This post is about my new job.  It's been a few months now, but I mention it here to keep things on the up and up.  Based on my pattern, I'm good for a few years until I yearn for new things.  Then again, I have a relatively small sample size.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my previous job.  The work was fine, and I had some friends amongst my workers (note: Crom wasn't one of them).  But I'm off to new things.  

I now work for a retail website (in fashion no less).  Suffice to say it's been a bit of a different experience since now it's less about the software and more about selling products.

Oh don't worry, I have some Crom posts backed up that I need to finish.  So stay tuned for those, but fear not for I have already encountered numerous other characters in my new workplace!  I suspect that this blog won't ever die simply because I need an outlet to tell the stories that make up my life.  You should be so glad.
