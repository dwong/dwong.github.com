I talked to a co-worker a little bit yesterday as he was getting some coffee at the same time as I was heating up lunch in the microwave.  I asked him how much coffee he drinks a day.  I was amazed and kind of sickened when he said that he drinks 5-10 cups a day (where he would want to do 10 if it's possible to get away from his desk).  

Okay so maybe I wasn't that sickened, but when he told me that at another job where he sat near the coffee pot (which was a [drip style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew) coffee maker) and drank 3 pots a day I was definitely grossed out!  What in the world?!  I, of course, asked him if he felt effects from it, and he claimed that he did not.  But I don't know if I believe him because that is just ridiculous.  Plus he then proceeded to talk about how if he drinks coffee with too much sugar he'll crash from the sugar and get very short-tempered.  

Wow, extremes like that usually seem pretty outlandish to other people, don't they?  They do to me anyways.
