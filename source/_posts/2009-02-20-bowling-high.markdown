Late breaking news, this just in.  I got my highest score ever in bowling recently.  While playing a game in the midst of bowling all I could for $5, I accomplished a feat that I thought not possible.  The bowling alley was old school, and we had to score our own games (it's amazing how few people know how to score bowling without a computer).  Still I think that the picture speaks for itself:

Lest you think that I am amazing at bowling, the score that I got the previous game was 98 thank you very much.  I must also say, though, that I didn't bowl my own third frame.  If I did, who knows what great and earth-shattering things might have happened!  

Also, I got sore from bowling that much.
