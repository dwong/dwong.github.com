I went to go get gasoline yesterday on the way home from work.  Of course I dreaded it.  At least it's on the way down right now.  But when I got out of my automobile to start pumping the liquid into my vehicle and my money into the machine, I saw something that took me aback.  There, above the very machine that was essentially taking my money was a television!  It was complete with sound and a fairly sharp display!

Technology is amazing.  They are able to put a television in a gas station!

But then I thought for another second and realized that they must have used some of my money in order to install all of these televisions!  Sure it's nice to watch the television for about 2 minutes, but I'd much rather have the money that they used back!  Just goes to show you that those gas station owners sure aren't on hard times.
