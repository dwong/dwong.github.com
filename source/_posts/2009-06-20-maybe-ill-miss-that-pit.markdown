After reading [The Long Journey From Obesity](http://www.boundless.org/2005/articles/a0002060.cfm), I started to realize that I was like the author before she became an obese person.  At times I look down on obese people because I think that it **is** possible for them to lose weight.  And while I still do think that it is true for them in a lot of cases, I can easily lose sight of the fact that being skinny is not the most important thing.

There are skinny gluttonous people and there are larger fit people.  Size is not of the utmost importance.  It would do me well to remember this.
