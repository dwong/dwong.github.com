I used to be
One of the few.
Now I am just
One of thousands.  Whew!

A big company means big things
Like long processes here and there.
They also block Gmail
Which doesn't seem smart, but I'm sure that they don't care.

Other things are great,
Company activities abound.
Is it somewhere that I'll stay for a long time?
Who knows if that's what I've found.

Changes are sometimes good
And it's already happened (June first).
So now I'm off and going
For better or for worse!
