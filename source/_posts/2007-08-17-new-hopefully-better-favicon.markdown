So I finally replaced the favicon for my website.  I suppose that it's been on my TODO list but at a low priority.  So low that I didn't even remember it.  Someone bringing it up will definitely bump that baby up.

So I decided to replace the favicon that was either




  1. A piece of poo


  2. A faucet


  3. A faucet of poo


  4. The letter P


  5. The road representing the path that the wong way is



Obviously everyone thought it was the last choice.  In any case, I went for a little different approach.  Now even though I'm no pro at creating images, I was still able to make one and put it up (as I said in [Favicons](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/13/favicons/)).  

This time I went for a couple of arrows.  At first I was going to put multiple arrows going one way and a single arrow going the other.  However, it looked pretty junky when I converted it to a tiny picture.  So I decided that enough with the nasty favicons, I'm just going with something simple.  So there you have it, take it how you will.  At least it doesn't look like a piece of poo anymore.
