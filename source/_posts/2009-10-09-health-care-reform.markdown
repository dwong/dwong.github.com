Nobody likes to pay for health services.  And health services are not perfect at all.  They (medical professionals) charge more than what seems reasonable, and they do not seem to have to answer to anybody except for the health insurance companies because they only listen to the money.  It would be nice to have personal doctors and nurses to tend to your every whim.  And it would be nice if you did not have to pay anything for it.

But this is not how the world works.  For one, medical professionals are people as well.  I am talking about doctors, not the rank and file like [medical coding](http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org) staff and assistants.  These are individuals who have gone to school, invested hours and nights to their profession.  (Well at least I hope that they have.  The ones that have not are not ones that I would ever want to go to.)  Their work is indeed important, and it is at times worth the cost.

People sometimes claim that a single entity watching over the entire operation here in the United States will be more efficient.  More efficient?  Since when did a government project ever win awards for efficiency??  Yeah that's a pretty crazy [health plan chart](http://docs.house.gov/gopleader/House-Democrats-Health-Plan.pdf), isn't it?  It is only a guess at what the new health government would look like, but it sure is a scary one.

If everyone has access to all of the doctors, people are going to take as much as they can.  Do you think that you will get to pay the best doctor what he/she is charging?  Well when everything costs the same for everyone it just logically follows that the best doctors are going to be as busy as people can schedule appointments.  People dismiss the supposed "death panels" that will decide on life and death decisions for everyone, but if there is a shortage of supply (doctors) compared to the increase in demand (patients) then some of those patients will have to be left out.  There is just no possible other way for that outcome to be different.

It is pretty debatable whether or not other countries have succeeded at this or not.  That is not really the question.  The question is: do I really want to cede more control over my life to the federal government?  To that I say no, I am still a huge fan of the [10th amendment](http://www.goingthewongway.com/512/10th-amendment/).
