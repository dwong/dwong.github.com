People want their private space.  People **need** their private space.  Some people have even been known to go crazy without it!

Unfortunately there are people who do not seem to really understand the whole personal space thing.  My co-worker, Crom, is exactly one of those people.  I don't know if I would go so far as to say that he enjoys getting all up in people's business (and by business I mean personal space), but he definitely does it the majority of the time.

It's even worse for the short ones!  He is pretty tall (over 6') and has a bit of a portly stomach, which I would imagine would make shorter people feel like he is intruding into his space even more if his stomach is near their face!  Thankfully I am not at that height.  Interestingly enough [his girlfriend](http://www.goingthewongway.com/914/crom-the-one-with-the-girlfriend/) **is** pretty short at (I'm estimating) 5'2".

The best part is getting to watch Crom do this to other people.  Unbeknownst to him, I observe him and amuse myself  with all of it.  What can you learn from all of this?  Beware of the watchful ones since they are probably analyzing and making fun of you in their head.
