Have you heard people talk about their spouse as "their better half"?  It's an interesting (and kind) thing to say.  Often it's the guy talking about his wife, but not always so.  It's slightly demeaning towards the "lesser half" (often self-deprecating since that person will say it about themselves) but that's supposed to be hidden by the elevation of the spouse.

So my question is, how can both of them be the better half?  I really don't think that can be the case.  I had a talk quite sometime back about this.  We talked about different couples that we know, and sad as it was we realized that we could usually think of one person in the relationship who was a better catch.  We weren't trying to be mean (at least I don't remember that being the intention, I think it was just a commentary on things that we saw).  Still, it's an interesting thought huh?  

Think of a couple, and I'd hazard a guess that you could think that one of them is a bit of a better catch than the other.  Now why this might be will obviously change from case to case.

Why did I write this?  I don't know, I just thought about it all of a sudden.  And I thought it was an interesting thought.  Don't read into it too much or your head will hurt.  And nobody likes headaches.  Nobody.  But do appreciate your other half for <del>what</del> who they are!
