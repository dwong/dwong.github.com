[**en**-mi-tee]


#### Definition:


Hatred, hostile feelings, extremely strong dislike



#### Example of usage:


I thought that my sarcastic comments only made them feel slightly embarrassed, but in truth their feelings had turned into deep-seated enmity.



#### Comments:


This is not in any way a long or strange word to most people.  However, I still think that it is not an often used word, especially when it can be used so much more colorfully than the favorite word "hatred."
