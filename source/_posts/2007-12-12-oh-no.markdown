Don't you hate the feeling that you get right after you realize that you've been caught doing something that you didn't want to do?  It's that feeling where your blood runs cold for a second.  Yeah, I don't like it either.

Even if it's something pretty innocuous and unimportant, I think that that I can definitely still get that feeling.  And that is no good at all.  But at least it teaches us that we should just not be doing whatever we're doing in the first place.

Then you go through the progression of




  1. I am so embarrassed/ashamed.


  2. I cannot believe that I did that.


  3. I hate myself for doing that.


  4. I am resolved to never ever do that again.
