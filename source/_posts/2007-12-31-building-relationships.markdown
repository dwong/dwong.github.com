I've come to notice recently that relationships are very similar to a house of cards.

Alright they're not always like a house of cards, they very much can be in certain ways.  When one is just starting to get to know another person, there is a lot of feeling out in conversation.  Both people need to be talking and questions need to be asked.  This is some basic knowledge about relationships.

Almost more importantly than how to build a relationship, though, is how easy it is to destroy it.  It's important to know how relationships can be destroyed because that is the only way that it can be avoided.  It seems to me that I can very easily liken the building of a relationship to the creation of a house of cards.  For both creations it takes far greater time and effort to build them up than it takes to destroy them.  With the house of cards all you need is an inadvertent swipe of the hand or even an exhaled breath to cause it all to come tumbling down.  With relationships (whether friendships, romantic relationships, or otherwise) a simple outburst, a snide comment, a hurtful action, or even an ill-advised joke can undo all of the time and effort involved in developing a relationship.

I think that whether you've been on the receiving end of a one of these relationship destroyers or whether you've dished one out yourself, you know that they're almost never worth it.  Unfortunately I think that most of the time people don't even know what they've done.  They can't see it because it's not visual, it's within the person.  Take a look around and you'll see cards everywhere.
