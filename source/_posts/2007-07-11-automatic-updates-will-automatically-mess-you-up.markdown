As if users did not make enough errors on their own, Microsoft is making life even more troublesome.  I'd like to know whose bright idea it is/was to automatically restart your computer after the automatic updates!  Oh sure, they give you a random pop-up message that essentially says "push this button or we'll blow up your computer."  And it will appear for about 1 minute.  So don't you get up thinking that you'd like to go to the bathroom or anything like that.  Nix the coffee breaks or the fresh air that you might like.

Somehow they assume that you are not doing anything important.  They don't save the status of anything nor do they give you the option to opt out completely from automatic restarts.  There's a fine line between doing things for the benefit of the user and annoying them to no end such that they want you to just quit what you're doing.  

It annoyed me before, and it continues to do so.  You'd think that someone at Microsoft would get annoyed with it and change it, huh?  I guess they don't get annoyed.  They're too busy being litigious.
