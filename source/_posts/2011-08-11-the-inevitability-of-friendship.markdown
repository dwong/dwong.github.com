I like having friends.  They usually share some connection with you and are able to share in experiences with you.  Laughter, excitement, and life all happen when friends are around.

But something that I am continuing to learn is that friendships will change.  As in, you will change.  Or the friend(s) will change.  Or circumstances will change.  Maybe you just stopped trying.  Maybe they slighted you in some way.  All of this adds up to your friendship changing.

So apparently I am much worse than I thought I would be at maintaining friendships.  People have come and gone in my life.  Some have left a mark (and amusingly many have not).  Many are now gone.

Now looking back on times long gone, I realize how difficult it would have been to predict how my life would have turned out.  Even if things had been planned or more effort would have been invested, I know that it would have been quite difficult to overcome what has turned out to be the biggest reason for all of the change: **life**.

Proofreading this post I have come to the conclusion that this could have been written by a lovesick high school kid secretly talking about some girl he had a crush on who just stopped talking to him even though all indications were that she liked him.  Not that I have that experience, I'm just saying.
