Have you ever realized that there are so many things that you do _not_ know?  I mean, even besides the things that humanity doesn't know (e.g. the cure to any of a whole slew of diseases, the details of all of the other planets and galaxies, where Amelia Earhart is), there are things that you just don't know like how to program a complex program, how DNA works, how to create a bookcase from a tree, how to cook a perfect turkey for Thanksgiving, and the list goes on endlessly.

So in life, we're always learning.  You've probably heard that it's pretty good for you to learn something new everyday.  And I concur, that's a great thing.  Having an open mind, being amazed, willing to be taught.  It's all swell!

I'm interested, though, in how there are differences to learning.  There is the kind that we learn because someone has taught us (i.e. in the classroom setting at school), but there is also the learning that comes out of a totally different intelligence/mind set.  While the former is good, I'm apt to think that the latter is even better.

Newton, Socrates, Einstein among a few all had to come up with things on their own.  They used logic, research, and intuition to arrive at the results that we now know all about today.  And while there are many things that have been figured out already, it's still pretty good for someone to separately arrive at the correct solution without having been taught it explicitly.  At least I think so.

So do you know anyone that solved the Rubik's cube without looking at the answer?  Yeah me neither.  Give the people that figure it out on their own their due.
