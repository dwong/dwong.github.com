Check out the [Silver Surfer Contest page](http://www.riseofthesilversurfer.com/searchforsilver/).

There are 3 contests including one that you can enter in every 24 hours.  

There is a contest for a home screening of the movie with 100 of your friends.  Hopefully you have 100 friends.  If not, who cares, you will after you win this contest.

There is a contest to fly you and 3 of your friends to London for the screening.  Hopefully you have 3 friends who are willing to accept free stuff.  Else I am very sad for you.  Or your friends do not know a fun time when it hits them in the noggin'.

The last contest is an instant win game with assorted prizes.  It takes 2 minutes each day.  I know that you have 2 minutes to spare, else you would not be reading blogs.  :P

Why wouldn't you check it out?
