Do you ever think that so much of the time, conversations with other people consist of talking about what you do?  Whether that means talking about what is going on in school, your current job situation, events that you've gone to, and so on, it's always rather based on past experience.

And do people read into it and see who you really are?  Well probably sometimes they do.  Nevertheless, it's very likely that only your closer friends can actually talk about other things.

When you talk to someone and you have to tell them what you do for a living, you know it's not going to be a mind-blowing conversation.  Especially if it's because you broached the subject after running out of other things to say.  It's even worse if you have to talk about the weather.
