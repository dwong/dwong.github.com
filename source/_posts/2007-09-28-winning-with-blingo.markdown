If you don't know, [Blingo](http://www.blingo.com/) is a website search engine.  You ask, "But there are tons of them out there, least of which Google, Yahoo!, etc."  Well this search engine is different because they give out prizes just for searching!  A hoax you say?  Well follow me as I take you on a picture tour of actually winning something!




![blingo_won_page](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1140/1454878422_156b25aee7.jpg)_This is the page that I came upon while doing a normal search._







![blingo_prize](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1018/1454010355_c9106a06b6.jpg)_Here you see the page of instructions that I got in an e-mail from Blingo after submitting my information._







![amazon_applied](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1170/1454878338_d13077b81a.jpg)_I conveniently had an open, not-yet-shipped Amazon order that I could apply this gift certificate to.  It works!_

So want to know more about it than just what it looks like to win?  Well I'm here to explain it to you (as I understand it from reading Blingo's website anyways).





  1. Blingo takes your search query and performs and equivalent search on Google


  2. Blingo receives results from Google and displays them to you


  3. Blingo also displays sponsored results like Google does


  4. Blingo makes money on said sponsored results


  5. Blingo buys some prizes with some of the money


  6. At specified times, whoever performs a search closest to the time they will be presented with the page that I was presented with.  You have won!


  7. Blingo doesn't use all of the money on prizes, I'm sure.  So they will make money, and you _might_ win something



That's basically how Blingo works.  So let me just tell you that I think that it's very reasonable to participate with them.  The way to approach it, though, is to:


  * Think that you would have searched Google anyways for whatever it is that you wanted.


  * Don't expect to win because the odds of actually winning are minimal.


  * However, if you do win, then super!


  * Don't perform extra searches for extra entries because you'd likely be wasting unnecessary time.


 
So you can see why I would think that it's worthwhile to try!  And now that I won, it has solidified my use of it.  They also have a neat affiliate program where you can sign up your friends.  If someone that signed up through you wins, then you get the same exact prize.  The winner's prize is **not** diminished, but the original winner and whoever referred them will get **exactly the same prize**.  If you'd like to sign up, then just click the button below.  (I thought it looked like a man with a rifle.  And I thought that was hilarious.  Let's name him Bob.)  What that means is that if you win, I'll just get a copy of what you win.  So we'll both win.  Let's win together!
