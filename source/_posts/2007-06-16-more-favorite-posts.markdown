And now presenting...

favorite posts in the sidebar!


Courtesy of the plugin that I used for my sitemap (as described in [A Sitemap For You And Them](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/12/a-sitemap-for-you-and-them/)), there are now the top (for now 10) posts listed in the sidebar.  "Popularity" is a rather arbitrary thing to decide, so my popular posts are based on a calculation using the number of views and responses.  Sometimes this means that the most viewed is popular and sometimes this means that the most commented is the most popular.  Is this useful to you?
