There are a lot of things that people do well.  Well, at least it seems like they do a lot of things well.  Maybe in hundreds of years people will think back upon our times and scoff at how poorly we existed.  That's kind of how we look back on other time periods isn't it?  Using a port-a-potty is bad enough, but a bedpan or an outhouse?  No way!  Using candles instead of having electricity?  Completely necessary!  But I digress (as usual).  Something that makes me angry is that people _are_ too good at things.  They are good at wanting as much money as possible.  They are good at looking out for #1.  They are good at being sneaky.  They are good at marketing.

What brings on this rant?  Well the gas stations!  You might think, "how in the world do gas stations market?"  Well I have some beef with gas stations.  Okay so maybe I also just have a problem with how gas is very expensive (and going up).  Nevertheless have you ever noticed the prices for gas?  Sure sure, we all know that they are currently low to mid $3 per gallon.  But have you ever noticed that it's always something like $3.199?  Do you realize that's essentially $3.20?!  If you think that I'm being stupid, then that's your prerogative, but I think that's slightly outrageous.  Do they really need to get that last 0.9 ¢??  And we are silly and oblige because we have to.  How unfortunate to be bound to something (gasoline) so tightly!

Too bad ranting and raving will do nothing to stop this practice.  It's absolutely worthless.  I wonder who is getting rich from the 0.9 ¢ extra from every single gallon pumped.  They sure must be rich.
