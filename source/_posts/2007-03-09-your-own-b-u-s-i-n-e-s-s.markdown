After reading a Los Angeles Times article similar in content to [this](http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2007/03/08/News/Facebook.Group.Lands.Usc.Football.Player.In.Hot.Water-2764591.shtml?reffeature=recentlycommentedstoriestab) article, I knew that I just had to make some comments about it.  In this politically correct country where everyone has their say and is entitled to their rights, there are many people who think that it's all very outlandish and ridiculous.  And not in the funny or amusing way.  I am one of those people.

Granted, I don't think that creating a facebook about the "Arian [sic] nation" is necessarily something great.  But it's obviously a joke and to make such a big deal about it is absurd.  They were printed in the LA Times, for crying out loud!  Ridiculous.

I'll be honest with you.  I can't stand people that blow things out of proportion like that.  They get hung up on the smallest things, but they have no idea that they are missing the big picture.  How did this politically correct trend begin?  Was it women's suffrage, or black rights, or what?  I have no idea because I'm no history buff or even well-versed in politics, but all I know is that it's irritatingly everywhere.

I propose that these people just quit acting like their feelings were hurt and get a sense of humor.  I've read that one (of two) of the worst things to hear is that you are humorless and cannot take a joke.  Well that is what I'm saying to this Stefanie Gopaul.  Live a little and quit living your life by riding off the lives of those around you.

Great, another rant.

*Edit*
Haha I can't believe that I messed up the HTML so badly that the link wasn't showing!  People must think that I sounded crazy talking about an article that they couldn't even read.  How lame of me.
