[**as**-_uh_-nahyn]


#### Definition:


Completely idiotic, stupid or silly; of or like an ass



#### Example of usage:


In school he was intelligent and knowledgeable, but in front of his peers (especially females) he would make the most asinine comments.



#### Comments:


You know that you like to call people stupid.  Well I'm sure that many people do anyways.  They must, otherwise why would I get called it so often?  :P  In any case this word is definitely an amusing version of stupid.  However, use it wisely because it is definitely harsher than "stupid" can be.  While "stupid" can be used in a joking manner, the word "asinine" isn't often used as such.  You have been warned.
