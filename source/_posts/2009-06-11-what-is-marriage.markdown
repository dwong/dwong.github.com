{% blockquote former co-worker about an unmarried couple living together %}
They're pretty much married already.  What's the difference?
{% endblockquote %}

What is the difference, really?  That is, I have an idea of what the difference is.  To me there **is** a difference between marriage and just living together.  In fact there is a difference between marriage and any other state that one can be in (e.g., single, friends, partners)!

But to the rest of the world, it seems like marriage is only an extra special promise to be faithful.  And legal rights and benefits.  Really, that's all it is to a large part of the world?  "I do.  I definitely promise not to be unfaithful to you.  You have my word."

It seems like people wouldn't try so hard to fight for it if that's what it is to them.
