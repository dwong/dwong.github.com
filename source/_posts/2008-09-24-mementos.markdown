In the journey of life, we have our ups and we have our downs.  How insightful of me to say, huh?  But along the way we each have the chance to collect little mementos that remind us of the stops along the way.[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="240" caption="Photo courtesy of Flickr user Cindy47452"][![Photo courtesy of Flickr user Cindy47452](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3168/2884620650_831cfeb7b8_m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/cindy47452/1021782142/)[/caption]

While some people don't have a care in the world for things that remind them of the past, others like to keep them for those occasional times when they'd like to wax nostalgic.  Some like to show them off to everyone, and others enjoy the opportunity to pull out ugly pictures, sappy love notes, and the like in order to have a chuckle or two even if it's just by themselves.

I bet you can guess which I like to do.  Because oh do I do enjoy it.

Anyways whatever the reason, I like to tell people to at least keep a box of the good stuff.  Even for those that want to clean up everything, the chance to look back on the path that you've traveled is a chance that you don't want to miss.  Trust me, it's fun.
