[ni-**fair**-ee-uh s]


#### Definition:


To be extremely wicked or evil.



#### Example of usage:


The nefarious plan to set him up to take the fall for the murder has been going on for ages!



#### Comments:


I like this word because you can use it for evil!  I mean literally.  Nefarious is so much more interesting to use than "evil" don't you think?
