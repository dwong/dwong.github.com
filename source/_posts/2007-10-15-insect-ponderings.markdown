Well seeing as how there have been more ants as of late, I've had a few thoughts that have crossed my mind.  Because ants do that.  They inspire me.

What would life be like without insects?

Well there'd be less annoyance because ants wouldn't invade your house.  Then again, who's going to clean up those little bits of food that you've dropped and are unaware that they're there?

Structures would be more sound because termites wouldn't get to the wood that holds it together.  But then how are you going to justify spending lots of money on rebuilding?

You won't get stung by bees, wasps, and more.  However, honey is very good.  And good for you.  And it doesn't expire because of its antibacterial properties "as a result of the low water activity causing osmosis, hydrogen peroxide effect, and high acidity" (ref. [Wikipedia's article about honey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey)).

As you're walking, you won't get attacked by a swarm of gnats that endlessly annoy you.  But then you won't get amusing things like [gnats helping the Indians win their game](http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=dw-aldsbugs100507&prov=yhoo&type=lgns).

All in all, even though there are lots and lots of things that I don't particularly care for about ants.  However, I've learned from reading [Foundation and Earth](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553587579?ie=UTF8&tag=gtww-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0553587579) that perhaps making worlds into what they were not intended has many unintended and distasteful consequences.  So let's leave everything as it was intended in its beautiful and wonderful balance.  Even if it can bug us to no end.  Sorry, I had to.  :P
