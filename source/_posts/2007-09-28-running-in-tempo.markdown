In Runner's World Magazine, I recently read [an article about tempo running](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-267--11909-0,00.html) that made me want to get back into the groove of running.  Tempo running (also known as lactate-threshold or threshold running)

Until college, I always despised any running that I did.  Whether for P.E. or for sports, it was always a chore that was done with little enjoyment.  A necessary evil that we a prerequisite for the fun of something else.

And then in college something changed.  My fitness level was probably about the same so that wasn't it.  My location and life were obviously different.  Whatever the reason was, though, I started to realize that running allowed me to:




  1. Stay fit


  2. Get some fresh air


  3. Explore the area on foot rather than in a car


  4. Spend some time alone in my thoughts



I would run the loop around campus on a fairly regular basis.  I even started to enter into a few races.  What a turnaround from only a year or two before!  In any case by the time that I left college I was fairly comfortable going out for runs for recreation and fitness purposes.  In fact, I was even going out with other people occasionally for a little bit of socializing (in addition to the fitness benefit)!

So enough about the history of me and running.  I started to recently run a little bit (only once or twice a week, mind you).  However, after reading the article I was for some strange reason under an incorrect impression about tempo runs.  I thought that they were run faster than they really are.  I mean, "an 8 on a 1-to-10 scale" sounds pretty fast to me!  But reading the rest of the article as well as [another article on tempo runs](http://runningtimes.com/rt/articles/?id=5615&page=2&c=85) made me realize that it's simply more of a steady consistent pace, albeit a pace faster than one might normally jog.

What I have been doing is running at a consistent pace but for only much shorter intervals.  This week I ran 4 sets of 3:30 runs at probably about an 8 minutes/mile pace with a 60 second jog between sets.  Let me tell you that it's not easy!  But I rather enjoy the challenge and am once again starting to enjoy the time alone, outside, and not in front of a computer (now that I'm in front of one the entire day for work).

I'm not sure whether I'm going to continue this regime of running at a fairly brisk pace (but definitely NOT sprinting) for longer periods of time or whether I'm actually going to try a tempo run for 20 minutes.  Whatever the case, I will continue the running as it is affording me benefits that I value.

Running is even more than just exercise, though.  Have you thought of that?  You can learn a lot about life from running.  You can learn about yourself: are you persevering, are you stronger in mind than in body, are you even in shape?  You can teach yourself to be independent and strong in mind.  Running a race has been used as an analogy to life, and that's because it is so true.  How better to understand the analogy (and correspondingly life) than by running yourself?

So go.  Do it.  Just do it.  (Does anyone remember Nike's once ubiquitous slogan?  Whatever happened to that?  They went from simple to complex marketing in my opinion.)
