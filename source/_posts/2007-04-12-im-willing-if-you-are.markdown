As many of you know, it is difficult to persuade other people to do things.  Whenever you want someone to do something for you (or for anyone for that matter), it can easily be seen that there is some opposition (small as it may be).  It doesn't even really matter what it is.  It's merely the fact that they're being asked to do more than they expected.  

I've discovered a solution of sorts in the last few years.  So perhaps it's not exactly a solution so much as it's a [tip for life](http://www.goingthewongway.com/tag/tip-for-life).  Basically I have found that people are much more willing to do what you're asking of them if you're also willing to do a part.  If you want someone to drive you somewhere, they'd be much more willing if you drove to their place and offered money for gas (which is getting ridiculously expensive, in my honest opinion).  If you want someone to clean, you are going to have to get down and dirty as well.  If you want someone to run an errand for you, they'd be more amicable if you're someone who has done errands for you.  The examples go on and on, but you get the idea.

Now this obviously will not work with everyone in the world.  But it is something that I think some people could learn from.  Nobody wants to be bossed about as if they mean nothing.  So you can't expect people to go 100% while you go 0%.  Think about it, and see if it works for you.  

Start to do things for yourself and thus **become the better person** simply because it pays off in a lifetime of independence and rewards.
