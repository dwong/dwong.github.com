[fuh-**see**-shuhs]  



#### Definition:


Not to be taken seriously or literally.



#### Example of usage:


You're right, he did say that his room was as big as an elephant.  However, you really need to lighten up because he was being facetious.



#### Comments:


This word is amusingly difficult for some people to say (namely [Kiki Honda](http://www.xanga.com/godschild1427)), but it's a word that you could use quite often.  Essentially it is an equivalent of saying "just kidding" after you say something that was not meant to be taken seriously.  However, one is usually intentionally facetious whereas "just kidding" has been known to just be appended after any type of statement.  Facetious is only a word to describe what you are probably already doing.  So now you know what to call it (hopefully anyways)!
