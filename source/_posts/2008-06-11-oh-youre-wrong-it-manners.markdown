Ever eat or hang out with someone who has bad manners?  Ever even notice?

I have, and I'm sure that I will.  But really I wonder about myself sometimes.  That is, I will often wonder whether I am that person.  Am I the one eating too much?  Am I the one who acts like a slob?  Am I the one doing something that everyone else talks about behind my back?

Yes manners are a social construct that simply ensures that there are people who can look down on others that don't know the rules.  As if life is a big game where someone always has to win.  So on the one hand I don't want to mind them because there is no absolute reality to it.

But on the other hand, while I am a part of society, society is also a part of me.  I've seen people without manners, and let me tell you, it isn't a pretty sight.  

So I'll do what I can and hope that I am not ever _that guy_.
