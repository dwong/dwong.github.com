If I could have your attention, I would rather like to quickly rant about something that I see all of the time.





  1. People pay for their own domain name


  2. Those same people want to get e-mail


  3. Those people proceed to register an e-mail address with some free webmail (e.g., Yahoo!, Google, etc)



Why does require a rant?  Because they paid for their own domain!  Instead of having to register SomeOrganizationSomeGroup@gmail.com, they could very well just decide that they want to get SomeGroup@TheirDomain.com.  Doesn't that seem more appealing?  Isn't that more professional and more enjoyable?  Yes, yes I think that we can all agree to that.  

The only argument that I can think of is that people want to be able to use the webmail clients to access their e-mail.  I hear ya.  But maybe more importantly, Google hears ya.  I don't want to be a Google salesman, but their [standard edition of Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html) is pretty free.  And that will pretty much take care of you.

Together, we can combat annoying-to-remember e-mail addresses.  We can do it!
