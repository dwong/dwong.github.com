Take this list and write it down.  Believe in it.  Win it.  Done and done, happily ever after.

  1. **Wing It** - This is especially important early on.  Everyone likes a man who can improvise.  It's probably just better to ask her what she wants to do when you pick her up.  Since you know, she might be very particular about the food she eats, the activities that she does, and so on and so forth.  So don't plan anything specific because it will just be a waste of your time.
  2. **Split The Bill** - This is the modern age.  Women are the equal of men.  And you know what that means!  She wants you to treat her like an equal.  Plus you know, it might not work out.  Either way you get to save more of your hard-earned money in the process.
  3. **Have Her Drive** - She probably likes driving anyway.  This will let her practice since girls aren't as good at driving.  Oh and you're going to do whatever she wants anyway.  So really, everyone wins.
  4. **Avoid Talking As Much As Possible** - Just stare.  She's beautiful, huh?  Talking isn't necessary.  She'll be won over by your style, charisma, and wonderful cologne.
  5. **Talk About Yourself** - When you do have to talk (e.g., she asks you a question) then just make sure to keep the topic of conversation on something that you know.  And what do you know better than yourself and your favorite things?
  6. **Come On Strong** - Only the serious-minded know that the secret to winning the girl is to either go laid back cool or full-court press.  So if you are going to the latter route then you better go all of the way.  5 course candle-lit dinner, sunset walk on the beach, hired Mariachi band,  horse-drawn carriage.  Go big or go home, buddy.  Everything that you see in those romantic comedies is fair game.  Failing those things, _at the very least_ contact her early and often after the date.  Show her how much you want more.  She'll reciprocate I'm sure.
