I don't like how it's impossible to get every last bit of semi-liquid type substances out of their container.  Even more than that, though, it disappoints me that this slight irritation happens so often!

So as you probably know (or at least can guess from my blog's name) that I'm Chinese.  The stereotype is that Chinese people specifically (and Asian people in general) are a little bit stingy.  Now, there are quite a lot of times that I can heartily agree that this stereotype has roots in reality.  Maybe it's because in China everyone has to fight for their own rights and properties since there are so many people vying for the limited resources.  Ah communism at its best.

But another thing that you should know is that I'm, in general, not very Chinese.  Now what does that mean?  Well I don't even speak the language, let alone act out the whole stereotype.  I am, for all intents and purposes, completely American.  Nevertheless, I do have a frugal side to me.  (I mean, I did share [3 Little Tips To Save](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/18/3-little-tips-to-save/) before.)  And that frugal Chinese side of me doesn't like that products are placed into packages that don't allow me to utilize all that I've paid for!

There are just so many of these items that we use!  Don't know what I'm talking about?  Well what about:




  * yogurt


  * mayonnaise


  * toothpaste


  * shampoo


  * lotion



And that's just to name a few!  There are obviously many other things that could fall into this category.  One would think that after so many years of production and perfecting the whole process, a better solution would have been reached.  But no.  All we get are cheap gadgets like the toothpaste clip that will ensure that as much paste as possible is pushed towards the opening.  Ah!

What's a society to do?  It's time for a change.  It's time for a revolution.
