So I just finished traveling for work.  It was quite an interesting experience.  First of all, I've not traveled for work before.  Secondly, it was supremely interesting getting to watch this whole slew of people that I would not normally get to watch.

People watching was probably one of the more interesting things that I got to do.



##### Why do we like to watch people?


I'm of the mind that we (well at least I) like to watch people because we are interested in the human experience.  Well that and because very often it's pretty amusing.  Or perhaps at the very heart of the matter, we like to see how we stack up against everyone else that's around.  Sometimes they're stranger, sometimes they're scarier, and sometimes they're just like us.  Alright they're never just like us.  We wouldn't ever want to admit as much anyways.

People are interesting.  Even the boring ones.  Because the boring ones are very interesting when they don't know that they're being watched.



##### Benefits of people watching






  1. ###### Laughter


You gotta hand it to people, they'll do some ridiculously hilarious things when they're unaware that they're being watched


  2. ###### Entertainment


Just because you forgot your electronic device or book, you'll still have something to do.  Almost no matter where are (unless you live as a hermit in which case this post is not for you).


  3. ###### Learn


Other people have had different experiences in their lives.  Perhaps watching them will teach you lessons about how you can be a better person.


  4. ###### Smile


Catch those "cute" moments that nobody was supposed to see.  You know, that darling thing that a child did or that self-sacrificing act that someone does for another.  It'll brighten your day and maybe next time you'll be the one who puts a smile on somebody else's slightly-creepy-people-watching face. :)


  5. ###### Help


If you're not aware or watching, someone could need your help and you would have never known.  If you're people watching, you're (by definition) aware of your surroundings.  So that makes it easier if you see someone getting hurt or in need of your assistence because you'll see the need and lend a hand, won't you?  Let's hope so!



People watching is a great thing to do.  And it's even more fun to do when you are surrounded by people that you would not normally be around (as I was this past weekend for my work conference).  I didn't know the vast majority of them, but I still enjoyed getting to watch them.  I got to see how they interacted, I got to laugh at humorous things that I saw, and I got to amuse myself even  (hopefully nobody really noticed me doing so).
