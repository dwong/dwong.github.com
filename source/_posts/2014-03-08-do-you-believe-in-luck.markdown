Luck is a strange thing.  People believe that it's out there helping or hurting them.  They believe that it is a force to be reckoned with.  With countless other things in the world people take to rationalism.  They deny spirituality, mysticism, and definitely things like Christianity.  But all around us people have ideas ingrained in their minds about luck.  Some examples:

 * You dare not shave your [playoff beard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_beard)
 * Saying "good luck" to someone before they go on stage for a performance
 * Don't do anything to annoy or bother evil spirits
 * If you win a game doing a certain routine, don't change that routine as long as you continue winning

The list goes on and on.  Superstitions, old wives' tales, and folklore.  By any of its names, luck abounds in all cultures.

I got to thinking about this because Chinese New Year happened a little while ago and brought [red envelopes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) with it.  It's interesting to be a Christian and Chinese at this time of year.  I shouldn't believe in luck, and yet I still accept these gifts which are filled with ideas of luck and prosperity.  (I've come to accept it as a gift but heartily do not believe that it wards off evil spirits or brings me good luck.)

Luck, and all of its spawn, are everywhere.  It will take some effort to avoid allowing it to take hold in my life, that's for sure!
