A touch
And...ah relief
But where did the precious item go?
It's probably at my feet

It's not there
I heard a tinkle, a sound of hard items contacting
But it's not there
Not where I'd expect it

I'm on my knees
Begging, hoping, almost praying
When will I know?

Now I'm searching far and wide
In the depths of despair
Amidst the trash and the disgusting
Nobody should need to look at this stuff, let alone touch it
But it's worth it

Who will accept it?
When will I be satisfied?
When will I know the secrets that I want to know?
Ah this is so much trouble
I want to rest
I give up

Oh.
There it is right under my nose!
Well, not quite _right_ under
More like a little to the right...
