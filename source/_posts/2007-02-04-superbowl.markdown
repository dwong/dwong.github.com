So I'm sure that there are many entries out in the blog world about the exciting moments from the Superbowl, funny commercials, and numerous other topics.  **This one is more important.**

Let me tell you, what stood out to me when I was watching the coverage and heard the stories about everything, was the life of Tony Dungy.

If you are unaware of who this is, he is the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts (the winning team of the Superbowl).  As I was hearing his story and reminded of the fact that this was the man who lost his 18-year old soon all too recently, I could not help but feel that this man had to be living differently.  His players and peers talked about how much they respected him, how he did not cuss (where the only time that he did was when he said that he was going to be on the "Best Damn Sports Show"), and numerous other character traits.  So I looked him up to see if he was a Christian.  And here are some of the things that I found: [link 1](http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_63714.asp) [link 2](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/feature/featureVideo?page=amazinggrace) and many others.

Here is a man who is unafraid to live differently, who affects the lives of those around him even in a sub-culture of extreme opulence and outrageous antics.  He is a man who strives to be the best, is currently there, but does not let that stand in the way of who he really is.  Whether on top or on bottom, he is someone who seems to me has got it straight.  And I like that.

If I had known about this before, I would have cheered a little harder for the Colts (not that I was cheering for the Bears anyways).  Nevertheless my hats off to a man can do what seems to be so difficult in the world today: he brings his Christian beliefs into his life simply be being who he is.  He makes people _ask_ why he is the way that he is.  He fights the good fight seemingly with his head squarely on his shoulders and his feet squarely on the Rock.
