I often figure that when I am in a large crowd, I will be much less noticed than when I am alone.  This often turns out to be true, and I often enjoy blending in with the crowd.  It provides a measure of anonymity that is sometimes desirable.

Weddings can be small or large affairs where each individual guest is merely a single person in a larger group.  So it can stand to reason that each guest will think that they do not stand out too much.

While we (my wife and I) made a conscious effort to be thankful for everything that was given to us, I have an insider's tip for everyone that has not gone through a wedding yet: the bride and groom notice a lot more than you think.  That means that your thoughtful, generous, cheap, or even missing gifts are noticed.  This directly correlates with how close to the married couple you are.  Do not be fooled into thinking that of 10's, 100's, or even 1000's of gifts yours will not be noticed.  While the day of the wedding might be a blur, the aftermath of finding out what people decided to gift you with is a much longer process that allows for more consideration.

The purpose of weddings is **definitely** not gifts, but I figured that this tip might be useful to a lot of people who had not discovered it for themselves already.  Either that, or we are the only ones, and we might have noticed you (for good or for bad).  Remember that sometimes it's the thought that counts and sometimes the thought only gets you so much.  And then you have to at least give a well thought out card!
