I think that commenting is one of the most interesting and enticing things about an online blog.  It allows one to share their thoughts, but it also allows others to give feedback on those thoughts!  I like to comment on other blogs, but I also like to respond to comments on my own blog.

So after participating a bit at [One Man's Blog](http://onemansblog.com) (who is also having a great [contest for becoming a "member"](http://onemansblog.com/2007/09/06/ombs-new-member-of-the-month-contest/) of his site right now where he gives away something to the winner of a random drawing), and enjoying it very much I decided that I would do something similar to what he does.  

Instead of [removing the nofollow](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/10/no-nofollow/) on each and every commentator's link, he instead creates a refreshed list of the top 10 commentators and provides them with a link back that way.  I think that after seeing how I can sometimes be getting the single comments just to get a link, I think that this is a more prudent decision to minimize single-line "spammy" comments.  

So therefore I am going to go for installing the [Show Top Commentators](http://www.pfadvice.com/wordpress-plugins/show-top-commentators/) plugin.

The way to get onto the list is as follows:




  1. Use the same information (name, e-mail, website) when leaving comments.  It might be easiest to simply register (which I have opened up) on my website.  You'll be able to log in and not have to enter your information each time you leave a comment.


  2. Leave comments!  It's fun anyways, I think to get to give feedback to the author (and be assured that authors do enjoy feedback, especially this author).


  3. The plugin will gather its data from the last 60 days, so be active else you fall and cease being the king of the mountain.  Hm I always enjoyed that game (king of the mountain, not falling).



Oh an don't worry, it will start immediately and retroactively use the comments that you've left.  So we actually don't start off with a clean slate, but I wouldn't think that would be fair anyways to those that have graced me with their participation.

I'm going to remove myself from any sort of communities for adding dofollow.  I don't really get too much traffic from them, and the traffic that I do get is usually people just leaving a single comment to get the link back to their site.  I like the idea of adding dofollow, I just don't like how it's worked out for me thus far.

Comments might not make the world go 'round, but they sure are more pleasant than the alternative.
