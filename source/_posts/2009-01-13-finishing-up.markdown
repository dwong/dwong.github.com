Not everyone watches television.  And even more than that, not everyone watches the commercials.  But recently there has been a commercial that contains the quote:


> I finish things.  That's what I do.

-Clint Eastwood (from the movie [Gran Torino](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1205489/))



While I initially started this post last week, I unfortunately didn't finish it before Gran Torino actually released nation wide on 1/12/09.  (How apropos!)  The quote is still interesting, and Clint Eastwood is still going strong as he nears the cusp of 80 years.

I see it all of the time: a carton of milk with a little bit left, a football player getting his arms on a runner but unsuccessfully bringing him down, books on reading lists that never get crossed off, leftover food that eventually rots, a job abandoned before its time.  All of these things are a task unfinished.

Everyday we perform tasks, and everyday we make choices.  The finish line was made not only to be reached for, it was made to be crossed.  Do I sprint, walk, or limp at the end?  Or worse yet, do I not even get to see the end?

Not that I'm there, but oh that I would live so that when I look back I can see that I made choices for completion in the form of empty plates, finished projects, read books, and tackled runners.  Especially tackled runners.
