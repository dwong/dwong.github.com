Man oh man.  In the last 2 and a half years since I've finished college, there have been all kinds of weddings going on.  Just the ones that I've been to:





  * Johann Wendy


  * Van Melissa


  * Matthew Kristen


  * Peter Kelly


  * David Lusye


  * Ben Noelle


  * Daniel Stacey


  * Jeremy Serena


  * Daniel Jenn


  * Dustin Valene


  * Mike Judy


  * Micah ChristiE


  * Garron Cynthia


  * Andy Robin


  * A relative wedding, neither of whom I would recognize



And besides that there have been other weddings of people that I know.  Too much marriage.  :P
