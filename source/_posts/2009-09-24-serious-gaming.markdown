I enjoy a board (or sometimes card or tile) game just as much as anyone else.  They are good clean fun that often test particular skills and attributes.  There are games like scrabble and speed scrabble, which test your vocabulary and literacy; chess, which tests your planning capabilities; and Nertz, which tests speed and awareness.

While I enjoy the games, I do not always enjoy the people that play the games.  I mean what is up with people that take games too seriously?  Games are fun, and I will play as hard as I can.  But it is never appealing when things get out of hand.

In particular there are some games that I cannot stand playing with other people because they tend to get much too involved in them.  [Settlers of Catan](http://www.catan.com/) is one of those games.  Since so much of the game is the relationships between the players in the game, it is extremely susceptible to antagonism, back-stabbing, and bitterness.  All lovely attributes.  It is an excellent game if you want to see the ugly in people, that's for sure.  People cannot help but reveal themselves a little bit when it gets competitive.

I will always remember a friend that I knew who was willing to give up a game (in that case basketball) because he was enticed to behave badly while playing.  He thought that there were more important things in the world, namely his Christianity, so he gave it up.  Admirable and encountered far too little nowadays.
