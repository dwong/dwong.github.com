Commenting is a fun part of going around to different blogs.  One thing that I've found is that it's easy to respond to comments left on my own blog because I have a central place to access them from (namely my WordPress administration panel).  It allows me to easily have conversations with people that stop by and leave comments.



##### Leaving Comments On Other Blogs


However I've found that it's not quite as to do with comments that I've left on other blogs.  The reason for that is because I don't have that central place to access to see all of my comments!  I'm not very well going to remember the URL of every post that I leave a comment on.  That would frankly be ridiculous.

I've found a key to this problem.  I'm sure that there are others out there, but I think that this one works decently enough.  Check out [co.mments.com](http://co.mments.com) if you want to see what I mean.  In fact, you can even let other people see what you're commenting on so that they can check it out and see if they're interested in the same posts!  Here is [my public co.mments.com page](http://co.mments.com/people/goingthewongway).
