I saw a license plate frame this morning on the way to work that looked a little like this:

 The Few, The Proud

  Native Californians


And I was just wondering who in the world was driving this car?  I _thought_ that it was a woman based on the hair that she had, but who knows?  I thought that maybe she was the wife of a marine because there was a large sticker on the window of the marines.  So I was thinking that she likely would be someone who simply was born and raised on California.  However, I wondered about who truly COULD drive a car with that license plate frame.  Would it be the Mexicans (well Spaniards then I suppose)?  Would it be the native Americans (commonly known as the Indians because of one Christopher Columbus?  Can anyone who is born and raised in California proudly bear the frame on their automobile?  

I'm definitely not a fan of someone who proclaims to be something they're not (imagine someone who graduates from one school driving around with an alumni frame from another school).  

Interesting thought don't you think?  I've never seen that license plate frame, and I'm sure that most people wouldn't think much more of it than the fact that they are a proud Californian.  But there seems to be something to it, don't you think?  The dislike of people who proclaim to be something that they're not.  The truth that you find when you dig a little bit deeper.  Or you find the seeming distaste that people have for thinking further than what their next meal would be.  What a tragic life.
