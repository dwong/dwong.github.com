Books are great.  They take us to far away lands and on many adventures.  They stimulate the mind and imagination to explore things that have been or things that could be.  But alas they are a dying form of entertainment it seems.  

Even with the advent of the digital book reader (such as the [Amazon Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-3G-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B002FQJT3Q/?tag=gtww-20)), many people are moving towards more quickly gratifying forms of entertainment.  We want games immediately on our iPhone (even if it gives us [ADD](http://www.goingthewongway.com/710/iphone-attention-deficit/)), we don't want to waste a moment of possible entertainment so we watch videos in our cars, and we maintain the convenient connection with people through Facebook and [Twittter](http://www.goingthewongway.com/83/tweedle-dee-twitter-dumb/) rather than actually interacting with them face-to-face.

Now it seems that lately people are progressing even further.  Many people cannot even walk around without rocking some tunes.  They do this when they're by themselves, with their family, or even with their friends!  While this seems to be more prevalent with teenagers, I have seen it with others as well.  Is it the incessant need to be entertained?  Is it the desire to shut out the world to live in one's own fantasy?  I daresay that while these might be true, it is actually because everyone simply wants to be the hero!  

Movies always have a soundtrack, and it is especially apparent during the monumental scenes.  What kind of a movie would it be if there was not music playing as the hero rescues the captive while avoiding 2 dragons, 10 soldiers, and a huge boulder?!  The music helps the audience experience the emotion and excitement.  

So kids these days.  They should be commended.  They just want to be the hero and do good in the world.  Or maybe they just need a jolt of extra emotion in their lives, which is probably good because many accuse them of a lack of passion.  In any case, maybe we should all just give a kid with headphones on a high five.

_Unless, of course, they're playing the villain's track._
