Well not that I don't like all of my posts.  Because I do.  Otherwise I wouldn't post it!  But I think that an especially good idea was for me to make a static page of some of my even _more_ favorite posts.  Find the page at [Favorite Posts](http://www.goingthewongway.com/favorite-posts/) where there is a link and a short description of the post.  So go on.  Visit it.  Tell your friends.  Tell the world.  I'm sure they're all dying to know how to go the wong way.  :D
