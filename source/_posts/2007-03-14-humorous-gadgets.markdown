After reading [this entry](http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/top-10-funniest-gadgets) a little while ago, I thought it would be appropriate to list some of my favorites.

Starting off with a slightly horrendous take on this iPod-centric marketing is this piece of work. To imagine anyone in their right mind buying this is absurd. To think, you couldn't live without your iPod for the 5-10 minutes (okay 1 minute if you're [this guy](http://www.xanga.com/fonghwang) haha) that you're sitting on the toilet. Take the time to enjoy your time off from your life. Relax and let it all out. And don't touch your iPod before washing or else people will post entries like [this](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/07/a-scary-thought/) about you!



![harder teeth](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/420716505_f45089498b_o.jpg)
See I personally think that something like this is a good idea. I mean our teeth are used in order to break down food that we eat, right? Well these bad boys will do just that. I have a couple of issues with it, however. Firstly, they need to get a model who is not about to fall asleep as she's wearing the teeth. Secondly, they need to remedy how extremely ugly you'll look when you're wearing them. [Jaws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_%28James_Bond%29), anyone?

Here is another gadget that actually seems useful. Unfortunately everyone will look at you like a fool if you so happen to actually use one. Everyone is better off when other drivers are considerate and expressive of how they actually feel. Unfortunately technology cannot make advances in all areas. It has to take a back seat some of the time (pun intended :P).



![fresh air machine](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/128/420716507_6a407be63b_o.jpg)
Oh man, this is awesome. Now I'm all for having cleaner air to breathe, but there are a few issues that I have with this. First off, what kind of mad person is willing to either carry that thing around or be anchored to one spot for a long time? And more importantly, how in the world does a single plant produce that much oxygen for you to breath constantly? I suppose it might make a tiny bit of sense if you just left it to accumulate fresh air and then you took a whiff every now and again. But even that's a stretch.



![Triumph Japan 2](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/421254893_c86d19fdb2_o.jpg)
Haha only the Japanese would come up with such a ridiculous invention. ([This](http://www.triumphjapan.com/release/unique/2006110700166.html) is why I know it's the Japanese who get credit for this one.) There's no way underwear should be used for anything other than being worn as such. Come on now, that's just gross.



![360 camera](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/420716502_8fafc806f5_o.jpg)
One of my favorite! I love the picture. I think that I might have seriously chuckled aloud. And I was by myself. To imagine this being used is actually not all too outrageous because of the high cost of doing this with a device designed for this express purpose. I just would really really like to see someone doing this. I also enjoy how they show you how to truly experience the 360 degree picture that you've taken. :-p



And to think, I always wanted to invent something cool. Why bother when I can live vicariously through all of these other inventors with the fortitude to do something about it?
:grin:
