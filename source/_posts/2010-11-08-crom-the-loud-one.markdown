There are plenty of loud people in the world.  That is not surprising.  But it is surprising when Crom is loud in the bathroom because I am of a particular opinion that most people try to be discrete there.  And he can do this no matter what he is doing in the bathroom.

He will walk in loudly as if he is in a rush.  He whistles and hums.

As he is urinating it is as if he is using all of his might to expel the liquid from his system.  Oddly enough, it seems as if there is air in the line since it will go full force then halt entirely then back to full force.  Even more odd is the fact that I have always thought that going full force (as he does) would result in more splash-back (if you know what I mean).  After expelling the liquid, he seems to like to let out a loud sigh of relief.  The sound makes me think that he is being intimate with the urinal.  That is just the sound that I want to be hearing from him.  Ew.  Just ew.  After that I sometimes _very_ unfortunately do __not__ hear the sound of the faucet.  Quadruple ew.

Now on the other hand, there are times when he poops.  I mean, [everyone does](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/192913214X?tag=gtww-20).  And those times are pretty loud as well.  But that's because he pushes that stuff out of his butt with as much force as he can.  At least that's what it seems like!  I can also discern that there is no toilet seat cover or toilet paper used to cover the seat.  Good thing he washes his hands after using the stall.

Welcome to the bathroom world of Crom.  It is a very unpleasant place for the rest of us.  He probably does not know about [some of my opinions about the bathroom](http://www.goingthewongway.com/176/on-bathroom-behavior/).
