This past weekend I completed the [Long Beach half marathon](http://runlongbeach.com/site5.aspx).  While it's probably no big deal to some people, it was my first so it was a big deal to me.  

Someday I want to run a marathon (some might say that it's on my "bucket list").  I figured that a half marathon would be a good place to start off at since the most that I'd run previous to my training was a 10K.

So it's done, now I just need to figure out when I want to spend $100 to run 26.2 miles.  Oh how I relish the opportunity.
