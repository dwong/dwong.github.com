There is a [Big Mac enthusiast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Gorske) and then there is a [big Mac enthusiast](http://theappleblog.com/2007/01/30/interview-with-jeremy-mehrle-uber-mac-collector/).

[Super Size Me](http://www.supersizeme.com) is so interesting because you see how crazy the whole culture behind McDonald's is.

Fans of Apple are interesting because they are such [fanatics](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/28/fanaticism/).  And so much media follows their every move.
