In the extras for the movie [Spanglish](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371246/), there is a deleted scene in which the mother prays with the daughter before they come to the U.S and says


> Please God, only let the bad things change me



Interesting thought, isn't it?  You probably have to think about that for a little to even understand it.  Well I did anyways.  I definitely thought it was interesting when I first saw it.

And then this morning I thought it was even more interesting as I was perusing the newspaper with [my breakfast](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/06/break-the-fast-twice/).  I saw an article about Lindsey Lohan's outrageous behavior.  Now granted, I do not know what Miss Lohan was like before she became famous, but I do know that it seems like more often than not, people are corrupted by success.  If you don't know about this particular case, she was basically caught driving drunk as well as with a substance, possibly cocaine.

In any case whether it be a star athlete getting a big head or a rock star falling into drugs or anything else, it's fairly safe to say that power and success can definitely corrupt.

I am not a big believer on following the lives of other people (especially "stars").  Still, one can't help but see that very often their world will get turned upside down and become less and less likable as their "star power" increases.  It's a shame that it's so.

I guess Spanglish has content that's deeper than you'd think.  Maybe it'd be wise to heed the advice.
