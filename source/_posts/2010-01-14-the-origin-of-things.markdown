Given enough time, we rather forget about the origin of things.  That reminds me of [Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy](http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-reading/the-foundation-trilogy-by-isaac-asimov/) where the novels are set thousands of years in the future, and the things that we know about now have by then become so far removed so as to be thought myth.  They could not fathom the planet that we live on, and they could barely remember that they had originated from Earth.

Even when we are not so far removed from the origin of things we begin to see disagreements about the facts.  As time moves on, opinions diverge.  Sometimes no opinion even leads to the truth.  Sometimes people become [fanatical](http://www.goingthewongway.com/10/fanaticism/) about their opinions.  In any case, we can see this phenomenon here and now.

Give a new idea a couple of years, and it will be as if they had always existed.  Nicknames just need time before they become the preferred way of referencing things (case in point: not too many people could tell you that "blog" is actually just a chopped up version of "web log").  Games are invented and taught to others with no regards as to why certain things are the way that they are.  It is amazing, really, to think of how much information we pass on without even stopping to think about where that information comes from.

It seems to me that the _most_ important aspect would be the origin of information.  I know that I want to know if I can trust the source of information before I willingly pass it on.

Oh by the way, [Lean On Me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_on_Me_%28song%29) is a song by Bill Withers.  You cannot use it for worship.
