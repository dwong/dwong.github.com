Jos at [NoDirectOn](http://nodirecton.blogspot.com) (that's 'no direct on', not 'no direction') thought that I should do this.  It's a real short one in which you describe yourself using a template of 7 words that start with the letter 'P'.  All you do is fill it out, link back to whoever tagged you and then tag others.  I don't do these things all that often, but it's nice to be thought of so I'll give it a go.

Passion - God, family, friends, fun
Purpose - Much more than the average joe
Pursuit - A life that is in line with what I believe
Position - Sitting.  Always sitting.
Pummeling - Rude drivers.  Pummeling is a funny word to use here.
Progress - Doing alright, doing alright.  Not doing so well on not repeating myself, though
Personality - Honest, realistic, slightly sarcastic

Usually you're supposed to tag people, but I think that I'm just going to leave this open-ended.  If you want to do it, go for it and let me know!  I can add you later and we can pretend like I tagged you in the first place.
