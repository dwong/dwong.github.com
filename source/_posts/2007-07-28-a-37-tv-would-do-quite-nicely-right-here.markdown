I definitely enjoy entering contests.  I always figure that you only have a chance if you try, right?  Well there's a pretty sweet contest where [5 Minutes For Mom is giving away a 37" TV](http://www.5minutesformom.com/2032/insignia-37inch-flat-panel-lcd-hdtv-contest/) (hooked up by [Best Buy](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=8274672&type=product&id=1171058029049), thank you very much).  All you have to do is leave a comment and create a blog post linking to them.  Pretty sweet deal for the person that wins, and it's a pretty smart move for them in order to get tons of link backs.  Everyone wins.  Well except for everyone who enters and actually doesn't get the TV.  So actually not too many people "win."  Oh well, I'm just hoping that I'm the one that actually does win!
