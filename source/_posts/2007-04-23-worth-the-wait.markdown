I want to wait
But I don't know if I can stay strong.
If something comes along,
I don't know if I want to wait that long.

You seem so far
I am so tempted by near things.
In my head,
A definite doubt rings.

"You need to give in"
And "It's not worth the wait".
Right there,
Those are some thoughts that I hate.

I want it to be right
I want to choose in a wise fashion.
Instead of waiting
To do the dashin'.

I wonder if I'm just strange,
Everyone else seems alright.
They're all satisfied
They don't lay awake and suffer in the night.

Longing for that 
Which is not yet here.
Won't you come
And be with me, dear.

What am I saying?
Do you have even a clue?
Well dear friends
I'm being dumb, that's true.

I just wrote a poem
And the meaning is not
Exactly what you thought.
You won't think it's hot.

Sometimes I need,
To really go.
Sometimes I am
My own worst foe.

The relief that comes
After releasing the stress.
Sometimes I think
That is the best.

The bathroom is sometimes where
I wish to be at.
At that time,
I don't want to chat.

I wonder if you can
Guess the other thought.
If you do then great,
On here you should jot!
