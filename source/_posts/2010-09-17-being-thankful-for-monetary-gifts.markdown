Growing up (maybe just because it was growing up in the United States of America), I have become accustomed to getting gifts.  There are presents for birthdays, graduations, Christmas, and other events that society deems worthy.  There are all kinds of gifts, too.  There are handmade gifts, clothes, toys, service coupons (e.g., breakfast in bed), simple cards, gift cards, and even the classic dollar bill(s).

As a child I used to enjoy getting money as much (and probably more than) any other type of gift.  It is of the utmost in practicality since it can be used for anything that the receiver desires.  It is also much easier on the giver since it removes all of the effort involved in finding and purchasing a gift.  

But I think, as a receiver of gifts, therein lies the reason why my embrace of money has declined as I have aged.  There is no work on the part of the giver.  Actually I should take that back because they do have to work at a job in order to actually receive that money.  But a giver of money does **not** need to wonder about the recipient's desires or tastes.  They do not need to go out searching for an appropriate gift that will delight.  I appreciate the work that is involved in all of that.  (Even if, sometimes, the gift turns out to be awful.  If that is the case, I indeed would probably prefer money, but I can still try to appreciate the work and attempt that the giver made.)

Which leads me to my method of dealing with monetary gifts.  I can happily receive such a gift, but I also try my best to set aside that money and use it on something pleasant.  In that way, I can tangibly interact with the gift that has been given to me.  I find that it makes me much more thankful to have, say, a room fan rather than $50 in my pocket that will be spent over time on miscellaneous soon-forgotten expenses (e.g., parking meter).  The fan can cool me on a summer night.  The $50?  Not nearly as well.

In any case, can it really hurt any of us to be more thankful people?
