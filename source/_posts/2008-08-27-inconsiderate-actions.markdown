Does anyone else wish that people thought about others more?  I can't stand it when people think that their actions have no consequences for other people!

Sometimes people will do horrible and disgusting things.  Sometimes they'll even admit that it's wrong.  Sometimes, though, it goes beyond reason when they do horrible things, and justify themselves to others with the opinion that it won't affect other people.

Spit out your gum?  Yeah, it'll get on people's shoes (or even my car!).  That is not a happy moment.

Throw your trash onto the street?  Someone has to pick it up, and it most likely is not going to be your mother.  It's going to be some poor soul who has to clean up your mess.

These things?  These are the least of the offenses.  The world is full of them.
