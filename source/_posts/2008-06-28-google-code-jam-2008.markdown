While many of my readers are totally uninterested in the fact that I program computers, the fact remains that I do what I do.  And thankfully I enjoy it (well at least most of the time).  Geeky as it sounds, I've also found that I kind of like to occasionally participate in programming contests.

I participated in the last Google Code Jam in 2006, but I didn't fare all that well.  Of course, that might also be because I decided to open up the problem and then go eat lunch after reading through it.  And did I mention that I only got an hour to work on it once I opened it?  I could have at least solved that problem!  I only needed 5 more minutes!  Although, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have solved another so I still wouldn't have done very well.

Anyways, to make a long story short, I enjoy programming.  And programming contests like this can be fun!  I'm currently trying out some of their practice problems, and I'm going to go with Python as my language of choice (last time I went with C++).

I don't particularly have high hopes for how well I can do, but it's still fun to try!  It's free, and fun (for some people).

Update: I suck!  I solved one problem's (Train Schedule) small input, but I couldn't quite get another problem (Saving the Universe) to work correctly.  However since they don't test the large input until the end, I found out that my large didn't pass!  And that means that I do not move out of the qualification.  Boo to me.
