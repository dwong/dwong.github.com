I seem to talk about advertising a lot.  Anyways, I was listening to radio one morning (I forgot which specific station it was).  I actually laughed out loud when I heard a commercial for a store in Monrovia called [Creative Woman - The Wizard of Bras](http://home.flash.net/~bras/).  Wizard of Bras!  I thought that was pretty amusing, indeed.  It's even funnier because it's a random thing to have a commercial for on the radio.  It's not as if it's a bed or electronic that everyone can use.  Although I suppose that if I could appeal to half of my audience then I would take that also.
