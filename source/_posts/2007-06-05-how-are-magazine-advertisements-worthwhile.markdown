Do any of you read magazines anymore?  Does anyone?  Well I do.  Sometimes anyways.

I've been noticing things about the advertisements in magazines.  Well I guess depending on the magazine that you are reading, things are different.  However, with some of the magazines that I've recently read, the thing that I don't understand is why advertisers would even want their advertisements placed in the back.  Do people even look at them (I know that I don't)?  Is their respective business increased as a result of being placed amongst many other advertisements?  I just don't get it.

Are they scared that if they stop advertising, that their business will decrease?  It seems to me that it's hard to justify the cost of placing such a poorly placed advertisement.  Well, the poorly placed is just my opinion.  Stuck in the nether pages with other random advertisements is not exactly a place that readers like to peruse carefully if you ask me.

I think that some of the best advertisements are those that give you something simply by looking.  Well I am still talking about magazine advertisements so this does not apply to other advertisements.  In any case, have you read those advertisements that give you some useful information and/or organize what they're selling so that it's very appealing.  On the one hand, I like these because they're useful to me.  On the other hand I have to take it all with a grain of salt because it _is_ still an advertisement.

In any case, I don't think that I'm ever going to be someone who will advertise in a magazine.  But then again, I guess that's why I don't make my living in the areas of fashion, car parts, or male enhancement gimmicks.
