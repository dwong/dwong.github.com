For those that have ever driven in areas that are unfamiliar, I'm sure that you can sympathize with my distaste for confusing addresses.

The thing is, it's so unnecessary!  Why must city planners do things like:




  * Same name but differing suffixes (e.g., Boulevard, Street, and Circle)


  * Same number for multiple prefixes (e.g., 111 North Main St and 111 South Main St)


  * Non-numerical order.  This can happen sometimes when changing cities.  And it's no good!


  * Non-standard street behavior.  I'm talking about the one way street, the blocking island in the road that restricts cars from entering roads from certain directions, or even a strange break in the road!


  * Buildings where you can't see the address numbers!  Alright so maybe it's more the fault of the builders of each building.  But still, it's annoying.



I am Derek, therefore I rant.  Haha.  So will city planners listen?  Doubtful, indeed.

Obviously my deal with it is that I don't like getting lost.  Who really does?
