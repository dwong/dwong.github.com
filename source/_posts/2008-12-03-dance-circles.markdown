When you're out and about, you might happen upon people that are moving to sound.  Yes yes, in life you might see dancing.  Whether in the club or at an organized school dance or at a wedding or in your house, dancing has a way of getting to people.  Some more than others.

Is it just me or does it always seem like people like to develop into circles when they're dancing in groups?  And where there is a circle, there will eventually be someone in the mush pot.  It also seems like there is a particular type of person that always ends up in the middle.  Maybe they like the attention.  Maybe they're trying to impress a special someone.  Or maybe they just love a little space while they're busting their moves.  Everyone who's not in the circle?  I think that they like the circles because they can be entertained without having to actually dance.

Me?  I say no to circles!  Fun for all!
