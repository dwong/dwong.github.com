Well, sorry to create a new post on the same subject ([Winning With Blingo](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/28/winning-with-blingo/)).  But I just wanted to let people know about some further information about using Blingo.  Besides, it's not as if this is going to be a series or anything like that.

Well it's worth revisiting because:




  1. I got no comments on the last post.  Not that I'm extremely popular but posts seem to get a fair amount of comments usually.  Thus, I have no knowledge that anyone read it!


  2. It's a worthwhile thing to do because I feel like people only stand to benefit from utilizing it.


  3. I'll admit it, I want you to join through me because I wouldn't mind getting extra chances to win things.  Who wouldn't want that?



In any case, for those of you using [Firefox](http://www.firefox.com) I have a tip for you.  Now you can search Blingo in Firefox without ever having known the difference!





  1. Go to "about:config".  This stores all of the configurations (sometimes hidden, sometimes available through menus) of everything in Firefox.


  2. Change the keyword.enabled preference


    1. In the "Filter:" text box, search for "keyword.enabled"


    2. Right-click the entry with the Preference Name of "keyword.enabled" and click Toggle (make sure that the value is "enabled"





  3. Change the keyword.URL preference


    1. In the "Filter:" text box, search for "keyword.URL"


    2. Double-click the entry with the Preference Name of "keyword.URL".  Change the value to "http://www.blingo.com/search?q="





  4. Now hit Ctrl-L (hold Control and type the letter l) or Apple-L (Mac OS X) to access the URL bar.  Type something not a website that you want to search for.  Try "Derek Wong" if you're unimaginative.  :)


  5. You should be directed to the Blingo search results for "Derek Wong"!



This is something that many people could benefit from.  Using the keyboard to access the url bar instead of the mouse is faster as well as minimizing ergonomic issues by using the mouse.  (If you didn't know, increased and poor mouse usage contributes to [Repetitive Strain/Stress Injuries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury).)  

Also this will allow you to search the Internet through Blingo (whose benefits I've expounded upon in [Winning With Blingo](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/28/winning-with-blingo/)) without having to actually go to the Blingo site each time!
