I am a big fan of [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) so it is no surprise that I use and advocate it when I can.  I would not consider myself [fanatical](http://www.goingthewongway.com/10/fanaticism/) about it (i.e., I will and do use non-free software).  However, in my experience and observation I have noticed how difficult it is for people to pay for software.  How else can you explain how we can pay hundreds to thousands of dollars for a computer only to refuse to pay $20 for a particular desired application?

It seems that people are confused about developers, especially those that create free software.  Maybe they do not think that the developers are entitled to compensation because they are releasing free software.  I guess that in part it is due to the difference between the definitions of free (as in zero cost) and free (as in liberty).  Software developers are (surprise!) real people that need to make a living as well.  In a world that contains both free (as in zero cost) and free (as in liberty) software, people need to understand both in order for them to see where the software developer is coming from.  So perhaps we can all remember that paying for software should be seen just like we should view all other purchases - if it satisfies our requirements for purchasing then we should go ahead and do that.

All of these words when this abbreviated comic (originally [here](http://theoatmeal.com/blog/apps)) says it perhaps even better:
