What up guy at the soda fountain using your definitively clear plastic water cup in order to get some soda?   How are your ill-gotten gains?   Tasty I hope.

I am sure that you have a good reason for doing what you do.  The world has probably beaten and berated you.  You deserve some of this sweet nectar.  Besides, you figure that it is a chain restaurant, and the syrup water that you are taking is really only worth cents to them.  If you have a job it probably is not the one that you really want (I mean not everyone gets to sleep in, tell people what to do, and have no pressure on them whatsoever).  Or maybe you don't get paid as much as you know that you deserve (it must be because people don't understand how much you are worth).

Some people will never learn to have integrity [no matter what they are doing](http://www.goingthewongway.com/6/cheaters-4-life/).  Some people will sell it for a little cup of soda.  Then again [others have sold much more valuable things for not much more in return](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2025:29-34&version=NASB).

So keep at it, sir.  I know that you will no matter what I say.  And good luck on that whole job of your dreams thing.
