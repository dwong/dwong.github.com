I'm never a fan of people talking on their cell phones while they're driving.  And now I'm even less of a fan since it's blatently against the law (whereas before it was just selfish to put others at risk).  They definitely don't drive as well, and that is a problem if I am driving near them.

What if I see a police officer talking on their cell phone?  Yeah, that's another layer on top of that!  They're supposed to be working, and I am fairly confident in my ability to say that they're not talking about work on their cell phone.  They are also not doing their job as well.  And that affects me just as much as it affects you.

Nobody thinks that police are perfect.  In fact they do all types of blatent things.  They speed (even when not purposefully chasing someone), they are sympathetic, patronizing, power hungry, and on occasion corrupt.

Well these are happy thoughts!  I should have taken a picture of the officer and put her on blast.  Hm on second thought, people with guns and power aren't people that I want to annoy too much.
