Are you often awed by things that you see?  I am.  Whether seeing little kids bending and contorting in Chinatown or watching Kobe Bryant do his thing, I try to be amazed. 

Can I first of all just say that Kobe Bryant is a pretty ridiculous basketball player?  For those that don't follow the National Basketball Association, Kobe scored 65 points on Friday night and 50 points yesterday.  So that means in 2 games, Kobe has scored 115 points at the highest professional basketball level.  I question whether I've scored that many points in games in my entire life combined!  Now, if you add in all of the buckets for shooting around, I'm golden.  But can you believe this guy?  I can't.  Was it a good idea to build the Lakers around him rather than [Mr. O'Neal](http://www.nba.com/playerfile/shaquille_oneal/) ?  Well that kind of remains to be seen.  But that doesn't detract from the fact that it's amazing to watch him make turnaround 3-pointers while double-teamed as the shot clock is winding down and the game is on the line.  I had to construct a run-on sentence just to describe the whole scenario!

A little girl bending over backwards as only those in the circus can do?  Pretty amazing.  I don't understand, sometimes, how others can have a body capable of such strange things.  I remember watching [Guinness World Records](http://www.tv.com/guinness-world-records-primetime/show/10187/summary.html) and thinking that it was so amazing that there could be people out there that could fit into a tiny box (or whatever the amazing feat of the evening was).  


And after seeing these amazing things over the weekend, I think:

_I wonder what my most amazing feat will ever be.  I wonder if it has already happened.  Now that's a sad thought._
