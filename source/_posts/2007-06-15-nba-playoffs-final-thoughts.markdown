This was originally going to be titled "NBA Playoffs (Thus Far Commentary #3)," but the Cleveland Cavaliers lost faster than I could write this post.

The Cavs were no match for the Spurs.  The real finals happened in the West, probably the Suns vs Spurs series.  LeBron James gets a lot of attention, but Tony Parker was the one who tore it up.  I said as much before the series started that Parker was going to be their downfall.

This was one of the least interesting finals series in a long time.  Instead of watching game 4 last night, I just decided to wash my truck.  

The Cavs were so over matched they couldn't even pull out 1 game (granted, they were close a couple of times).  Even the Lakers took one from the Suns!  How's that for an insult?
