I like games.  Some games I like more than others.  I'm particularly a fan of word games even though I don't get to play them all too much nowadays.  I like games that involve decision making because that increases the possibility of losing.  I like some card games, but I'm no gambling bo.  (Why bo?  Why not?)

Over at [Ramblings From The Marginalized](http://www.hmtk.com), Steve has just created [Quartile](http://www.hmtk.com/archives/quartile.html).  Yes that's right, he made the game.  That is pretty amazing, I think.

So looking at the game, it seems pretty interesting, even if the concept is a bit simple.  It seems to me to be a mix of Scrabble and dominos where instead of piecing together words with letters, you place seemingly domino pieces in arithmetically corresponding spaces.  I must admit that it even seems simple when I write that, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't also look enjoyable!  Just look at the Wii, it's doing so well because it purports to be a simple to use gaming system that focuses on fun rather than complexity!

In any case, he has this pretty cool offer to give away one of his prototype marble sets.  (The retail sets are made of wood as that is obviously cheaper to produce.)  So check out his site for more information on the whole shebang.
