It should come as no surprise that you are not always correct.  And this even though you probably think that you **are** always correct (as I talked about in [Algorithm For Your Life](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/).

When you have a wrong opinion and are faced with facts, are you willing to alter your thoughts on the matter?  It'd be hard to find someone that doesn't think that sounds reasonable.  But it might come as a surprise to you that I feel as if I see that people are not always so.  But why?

I think that a large part of the difficulty is that changing is tough to do.  It is a rather outright admission that you are wrong.  Nobody wants to be wrong.  It's also admitting that you don't know it all.  And don't we all wish that we could be a know it all?  (That's a bit sarcastic for those that can't sense it since I obviously think that [Experience Matters](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/01/experience-matters/).)

Be willing to change, you might find that it's not as hard or stressful as having to know everything.
