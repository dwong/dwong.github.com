How do you alter someone's mood and behavior so that they become a monster?  What's the secret to finding out what they're really like?

A box.  Yes, put them into a box.  Of course, most of us don't want to be put into a box because we feel that it inhibits who we are.  We don't want others to define us.  And that makes sense.

But I'm talking about a metal box.  In fact it's a metal box that rolls around.  And when you put someone inside you get to see their rage, impatience, and overall self-centered nature.  It's like releasing The Incredible Hulk, without all of that gamma mess.  It really is pretty shocking.

When you use the box, you will get to see how people love to do things for themselves.  In particular, they like to cut in line.  Can you imagine if they did that to you while waiting in line at the bank?  Perhaps when the teller says, "Next," they will jump the line and just go up.  What kind of an uproar would that cause?  I'm pretty sure they'd meet with some fairly vocal outrage.  But in the metal box?  It all comes out.
