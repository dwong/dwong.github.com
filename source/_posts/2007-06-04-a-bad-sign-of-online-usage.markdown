So I was reading PC Magazine (we got it free for some reason), and I saw this little side article that I thought was pretty amusing.  It had a list of AIM acronyms that are not all too commonly used taken from America Online, 2007.  Now most people nowadays know of things like LOL (laugh out loud), BRB (be right back), and TTYL (talk to you later).  But those are maybe just the originals and can't necessarily say exactly what you want.  Or maybe they're so overused that they're boring.  In any case, if you already knew any of the following, you have been online far too much.  You need to get your pale self outside and greet the sun more often.





  1. **ADAD**_another day, another dollar_


  2. **DQMOT**_don't quote me on this_


  3. **BITD**_back in the day_


  4. **SMFETE**_smiling from ear to ear_


  5. **GOL**_giggling out loud_


  6. **IMNERHO**_in my never even remotely humble opinion_


  7. **BTDTGTTSAWIO**_been there, done that, got the t-shirt, and wore it out_


  8. **PRW**_parents are watching_


  9. **WYGOWM**_will you go out with me?_


  10. **MTFBWU**_may the force be with you_



Personally I'm a fan of WYGOWM and BTDTGTTSAWIO.  Maybe you can find an occasion to use them.  ADAD is amusing just because the saying is amusing.  If I ever encountered acronyms like this online, I would be totally confused.
