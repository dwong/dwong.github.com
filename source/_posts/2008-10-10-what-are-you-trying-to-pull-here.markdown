I went to Marie Callender's in order to get a pie ([they're on sale](http://www.mcpies.com/our_food/featured_pie.php)) a few days ago.  Specifically I went to go get a Double Cream Blueberry.

As I was walking out of the house I made sure that I had enough money, and I also grabbed a handful of coins off of my bookcase because I was running low in my car.  So I get to Marie Callender's and order my pie.  Since I had a tin (they require a 50 cent deposit on them to make sure that people bring 'em back) the cost was $6.99.  I looked in my wallet, and I saw that I had one each of $20, $10, $5, and $1 bills.  Sweet!  So I grabbed the $5 and the $1 bills and started rummaging in the handful of change that I grabbed out of my car as I was getting out.  I saw that I had 3 quarters, 3 dimes, a nickel and 3 pennies.  (On another note, is it sad that I still remember all of this a few days later?)  Sweet again!  I can make over 99 cents with the coins that I had so I didn't have to get more change.

The cashier starts looking at the coins (understandable since she needs to count it out), and she starts to mildly protest.  I wonder what's up, and she asks me what "this" is?  She's holding up one of the quarters.  And...it's a [Chinese coin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_yuan).  Oh my, I am slightly embarrassed.  Then I realize that I'm going to have to take **all** of the money back since I couldn't make another 25 cents.  Haha I felt pretty silly having to take it back and give over the $10 bill.  Thankfully the cashier didn't seem to mind too much.  She did make a comment that it was Japanese or something, to which I mumbled, "Er yeah something like that."  I was too sheepish to correct her.

The whole time after that I was thinking that she might have thought, "What is this Asian guy pulling here?"  So Marie Callender's cashier, if you're reading this, it was an honest mistake.  I wasn't trying to cheat.  It's also kind of unrelated, but I'm really not that Asian that I usually carry around Asian currency with me.
