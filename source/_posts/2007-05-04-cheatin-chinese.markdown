Sometimes Chinese people do good things.  Sometimes Chinese people do bad things.  And sometimes Chinese people sure do some stupid things.

Get this: Chinese people copied Disneyland.  As in, they made a Disneyland **park**.  Are you kidding me?!

I read [an Engadget article about the fake Disneyland](http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/04/keepin-it-real-fake-part-lv-disneyland/) that got me to searching for more information.  Amusingly, they have characters that closely mimic the Disney ones as well as rides that indicate how much of a fake it is.  Their slogan (according to [this other article](http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=20&art_id=41990&sid=13078355&con_type=1&d_str=20070411)) is that "Disneyland is too far."  Wow, that is unbelievable.  I think that actually the most amusing thing about Beijing's Shijingshan Amusement Park is that its website is [http://www.bs-amusement-park.com](http://www.bs-amusement-park.com).  Haha you read that right, it's the BS amusement park.

Although pretty humorous, this actually touches on a more serious issue (which was touched on at [Even Worse Than At First Glance](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/14/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/)).  And that issue is copyright infringement (or in this case complete disregard for copyrights whatsoever).
