Reading never gets old.  Well not to me at least.  It's something that I've enjoyed during my life, and it's something that I make a point out of continuing to do.  

In any case, I just finished [The Foundaction Trilogy by Isaac Asimov](http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-reading/the-foundation-trilogy-by-isaac-asimov/).

Why is reading books never old (in comparison to reading things online)?




  1. They're available even if there is no electricity.


  2. You can take them anywhere, even if there is no Internet connection there!


  3. They're sometimes more readily accessible than reading things online.  Try searching for copies of all of the classics freely available online.


  4. You get cultured when you read them.  How else will you know where famous sayings and quotes come from if you don't actually read them?  It'll make you look less ignorant when someone uses a quote from a book and you've already read that book.


  5. It gives you an aspect of your life that is actually changing.  Even if everything around you seems to be droning on in the same old manner, at least you'll be able to talk about how the book that you're reading has been exciting (or not) to you.


  6. You look more well-balanced to other people.  Someone who is reading looks a lot more balanced than someone who is staring at a computer screen all of the time, wouldn't you say?



Do a lot of people still read?  I have no idea.  I was also tempted to put something related to decreasing chances for poor eyesight, but I don't actually know if that's true or not.

That was a lot longer than I had envisioned that post being.
