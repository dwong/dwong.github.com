So I've been using [feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com) for stats on my website lately.  It's just a little bit of [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript) added to the templates.  Pretty simple.  Except it wasn't working today!  It kept showing 0 visitors when I know for SURE that there were visitors (like me!).  What's going on?? 

Of course [Kiki](http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427) noticed that my theme had changed to the default earlier this morning.  I'm not sure what was going on, but it might perhaps be related to that?  Anyways the change caused me to look for something else out there that could help me out.  I've used [site meter](http://www.sitemeter.com) before but I don't like how there's a little icon when you add the code to your page (although now that I think about it, I realize that I know a lot more about HTML and Javascript now compared to when I added that code to [my xanga](http://www.xanga.com/keleka) so I could easily just remove the image and retain the functionality.  But that's a moot point now).

So I found **[statcounter](http://www.statcounter.com)** which seems to work very well.  There's more information gathered and available than at sitemeter and it's more real-time than feedburner was.  So I'm pretty happy with it thus far.

To make it even better because there's apparently [a sitecounter for wordpress plugin](http://citizenk.wordpress.com/wp-plugins/statcounter-for-wordpress/)!  That's super!  (Note: I had to download [the php page](http://download.almaren.ch/view.php?file=/code/wordpress/wp-plugins/statcounter/statcounter.php) itself because the zip file was linked incorrectly, but the installation was the same and went smoothly)

So I just thought you'd like to know that you're being tracked a little bit.  Not as if you didn't expect it.

I thought that the "blog" category needed another entry so that the "Rant" category could take a well-deserved break.  :D
