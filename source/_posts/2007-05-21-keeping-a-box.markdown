Read through old notes from those that might or might not have been interested in you.  Find out both how weak the writing skills of young people can be as well as how strange you must have been to have thought it personally normal to interact with people in this way.

Watch videos of yourself as a kid that show that you had the makings of who you are even back then.  Even if that means that you were one who found humor in bullying others.  

Flip through some pictures that will make you laugh and some that will make you grimace.

It's amusing to look back, wouldn't you say?  Even though junk is not something that I'd prefer to keep around in general, you also have to know what to save.  A box full of memories is something that everyone would do well to keep.  Just think about how it can be used for instant fun when you can't think of anything else.  Or like when you can't think of anything to blog about.
