After a few years on the job, I have seen a number of things that I find rather peculiar.  While I wouldn't say that I meet people from all walks of life, I have met quite an assortment of people.  I have realized that people are different from me.  Some of them are _very_ different from me.  

Take these examples:

* Cutting other people off while they're talking.  It seems that people need to get a word in edgewise, and they find that the best time is when someone else is talking.
* Food service help.  Some people are very helpful when it comes to preparing food for company events (e.g., BBQ, birthday cake).  However, their grasp of cleanliness seems to be different from mine.  They are very open to the idea of eating the food while preparing it.  They are totally [down](http://go.gtww.net/14hQQik) with using their bare hands to touch food.  Yum!
* Covering their mouths when coughing and sneezing.  No explanation really needed.  Everyone should always cover up!
* Washing their hands after using the bathroom.  And some of the people that do wash their hands do not seem to understand that hand washing is even better when you use soap.  The sign with "Lavese Las Manos Antes De Salir Esta Sala" should probably mention soap.
* Speaking in a foreign language (literally) around other people.  The people that do not speak that language are likely to suspect that you're talking about them.  And they're probably correct about that.

Welcome to my life, where things can always be amusing.  You just have to notice them.
