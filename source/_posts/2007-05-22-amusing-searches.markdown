So another advantage to hosting my own blog (okay it's not _just_ limited to hosting yourself) in addition to other [costs and benefits of running your own server](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/15/cost-and-benefits-of-running-your-own-server/) is that you get to see statistics.  You can install any type of tracking system.  I personally am using [Statcounter](http://www.statcounter.com/) and [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), but there are a plethora of options out there.

In any case I'd like to share what some amusing searches on my site have been:




  1. **pastor "Derek Wong" **- _Say whaaatt?  Haha_


  2. **siafu ant** - _One would think that I would get no hits on the Siafu Ants since there are other much more reputable sources than my blog on a species of ant.  Oh well._


  3. **tweedle dee tweedle dumb **- _Apparently nobody writes about Alice in Wonderland anymore._


  4. **how to use gimp to make a passport photo** - _I would guess that someone could arrive at my site on this because it's a pretty specific topic that I wrote a post about._


  5. **Jennifer Shih facebook **- _Now that's just strange.  Quit it stalker kids.  Or rather, quit it stalker boys.  :P_


  6. **amazing gross photos **- _I think that's awesome that they could arrive at my site on these keywords!  Of course I probably disappoint because I don't exactly have amazingly gross photos._


  7. **wong way poet **- _That seems pretty specific to me.  You'd think that they could just remember "goingthewongway" if they can already remember "wong way."  Or maybe there is just some poet out there named wong who is writing about the way.  I bet he wants my domain name.  :P_


  8. **california dmv temporary-operating-permit **- _I'm very happy that I can provide the answer to this.  I know that I would have wanted to happen upon the answer in a quick search!_



Okay that is just a taste.  And considering that some of these searches are old, I make no guarantees that you will still find me indexed for these keywords.  I just wanted to share how amusing it is for me to see these things.
