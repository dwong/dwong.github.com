Do you like car salesmen?  I don't.

They're pushy, they're slightly overbearing, and they only want to be your friends to make money off of you.

Case in point:

I read an article about an incident that outraged me.  It also solidified my distaste for car salesmen.  In the May 2007 edition of [Car and Driver](http://www.caranddriver.com/) magazine, I saw an article about a man who went into a dealership to buy a car.  He ended up buying a GMC Canyon.  This man was mentally disabled (he was later reported to have had feces-covered pants on) with a reported IQ (from a relative) of 70.

To buy the Canyon, the man paid in cash (approximately $30,000) and ended up telling the salesman that he actually had a lot more cash at home.  Granted this isn't exactly a wise thing to do, but this man was also understandably mentally disabled.

Events proceeded and the man one day thought that his truck had been stolen (when in fact it turned out to have been towed).  He called up his salesman buddy for a ride who then took him to the tow yard.  While driving him, the other salesmen who had conspired together proceeded to go to the man's home and steal the money.  They ended up leaving with $70,000.

The police then came to the house to investigate the crime and upon finding feces throughout the house, had the mentally disabled man committed to an institute.  A salesman kindly took the time to go to the institute, get the man to sign over the Canyon to _him_, and charged him for the time that it took to do so!

Subsequently, lawsuits were brought against many of the salesmen, the dealership returned the $100,000 to the man, and some semblance of justice was served.

Suffice to say, I am still not impressed with salesmen.  **Especially** those of the car variety.
