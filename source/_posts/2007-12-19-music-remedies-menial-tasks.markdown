Everyone has to perform menial tasks.  Well I guess not everyone, but those of us who actually have to clean our own house, iron our own clothes, and wash our own dishes do.  They're not fun.  That's why they're deemed menial tasks!  But for myself, I've found that music is making them much more tolerable.

I think that I was finding that having these tasks to do (not necessarily everyday, but very often) was causing me to start doing them rather begrudgingly.  It's not that I hate the idea of doing work, but I just don't like having multiple completely lacking in fun tasks queued up for me to do.  They're often monotonous and sometimes even physically tiring!  Nobody considers them fun.  But there's hope!

People have known for so long that music speaks to us in ways that are indescribable.  And I've found that simply listening to music while performing tasks that I would not otherwise prefer to do makes them all the more bearable.  Now whether that's because I can dance around, hum, or bob my head, who's to say?  All I know is that it's there, and it's good.

From John Mayer to DJ Maj to Al Green to Frank Sinatra to Deitrick Haddon & Unity Praise to Norah Jones to Bleach, and so on and so forth, I like me some music.  No point in letting those 100s of CDs worth of music stay silenced.
