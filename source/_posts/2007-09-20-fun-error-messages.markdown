Nobody likes to get error messages.  But I must admit that I do like it when they're fun.  Better than getting a stack trace (but usually not as helpful).  They might not make up for the fact that your computer just messed up, but they'll let you know that the people behind the messages are real people as well.

This particular goodie was probably a result of outpacing the browser with the keyboard shortcuts.  Yes you better believe it, I am that fast.

These are the kinds of people that live by the "if life gives you lemons, then make lemonade" mentality.  Good for them.
