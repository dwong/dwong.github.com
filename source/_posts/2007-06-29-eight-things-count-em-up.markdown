I was tagged for a meme by Ms. Q over at [qmusings.com/blog](http://qmusings.com/blog).  Thanks for the tag!  Although I'm sure that many of my readers will know a lot of this already, I'm sure that there are others who don't.  Besides, I'm always up for a new idea for a post!





  1. Each player must post these rules first.


  2. Each player starts with eight random facts/habits about themselves.


  3. People who are tagged need to write their own blog about their eight things and post these rules.


  4. At the end of your blog, you need to choose eight people to get tagged and list their names.



  5. Don’t forget to leave them a comment telling them they’re tagged, and to read your blog.



Here are the eight!


  1. I played badminton in high school.  It's not your average backyard game.


  2. I have more in common with Michael Bolton than one would think.  No, not that one, the one of [Office Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space) fame.  And he'd be angry that you thought of that one first.


  3. Before sitting on the toilet in a public restroom to do my business, I'm not satisfied with the toilet seat covers that they provide.  So I put that one on first, then use about 10 squares of toilet paper to make sure that there is no butt-toilet seat contact happening.


  4. I tried to read _A Tale Of Two Cities_ when I was in 4th grade.  I gave up at about Chapter 3.  I guess that I wasn't as advanced as I thought!


  5. I enjoy thrift shopping so much that I would estimate that I have at least 20 articles of clothing purchased from said thrift stores.


  6. In high school I took a photography class where we got to shoot pictures using a film SLR and perform the entire process from shooting to developing to printing (and even mounting!)


  7. I've never been stung by a bee (or wasp or hornet or anything else that flies and has a stinger)


  8. As of this moment, I have over 22 GB of music.  As well as the over 250 CD's that I legally bought them on.  (I obviously don't like that [Music Piracy Makes People Stupid](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/14/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid/))



Now I'm supposed to tag eight people.  Okay so if they'd like:


  1. Tiffany at [xanga.com/TuMbaLiNa3](http://www.xanga.com/TuMbaLiNa3)


  2. William at [Writing is Fun and Productive](http://eclectiastes.blogspot.com/)


  3. Rory at [hamelife](http://hamelife.com/)


  4. Kiki at [xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427](http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427) (I never realized, that upper and lower case is so annoying to type out!  And both you _and_ Tiffany have it!)



Okay I totally ran out of ideas of who I wanted to tag.  So if you'd like to be tagged, let me know and I can.  :P  It's a quick and interesting post.  It was actually pretty interesting to write as well since it made me think of interesting things about myself!
