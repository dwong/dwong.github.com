![facebehindtheblog](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1182/536501267_8897fd1b1f_m.jpg)I was tagged for the Face Behind The Blog meme by Rory of hamelife.com. I enjoyed reading his, and I realize now that people might enjoy one that I did as well. I must admit that when I stopped to think, I realized that I actually had not put any pictures of myself on this blog. I am some anonymous (presumably) Asian male who writes for this blog. Well well well that's interesting. So here we go!

I thought that I'd post pictures marking periods of change in my life. Oh and sorry that the quality is not very good. It was partly because I don't have a quality scanner to get those prints that are only in hard form, and it is also partly on purpose because I don't want high quality pictures of me floating around on the Internet. You never know what incriminating things people can do to you. ;-)

Ah young Derek, eagerly awaiting his birthday cake. I believe it was an ice cream pie. Those are good, indeed. Notice the obscenely large glasses. I believe the proper term for me back then was baller. :P

This was taken right before I got braces to fix those horrendous canine teeth. <del>bicuspids. (That would be the canine teeth if you didn't know.)</del> I had fun during that time but boy did those canine teeth <del>bicuspids</del> cut my lips!

![high_school](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1061/537843610_f549cce98e_m.jpg)
A pictures of myself from high school. Thus marked the end of my strange (for the most part) days. This was taken sometime in the middle of high school. I didn't like that time period in my life. But the pictures weren't bad.

Here I am in China, and it is the most recent of the bunch. As you can see, I'm a much more interesting fellow. I'd like to think that I've come into my own and am comfortable in my own skin. :D Also notice the advent of the digital camera. Splendid!

So in continuing with this fun game, I'd like to tag Shelly at This Eclectic Life, Mat at matkishimoto's blogspot, Ms. Q at qmusings, and HMTKSteve (strangely enough I don't know if his name is actually Steve :P) at Ramblings of the Marginalized. You are by no means obliged to do this. I just thought that these would be some interesting people to see what kind of "different" pictures they could put up of themselves.
