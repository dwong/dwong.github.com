Friends are such an integral part of life.  They are there for us to have fun, to share with, and to truly live our lives with.  And, just as in many of our relationships in life, they can be a source of pain.  I'm not necessarily saying that I feel that right now, but that doesn't discount the truth in the statement, does it?

People have a tendency to let relationships deteriorate.  It takes constant effort and a willing heart to maintain those relationships that might otherwise fall by the way side.  Being a couple of years out of college I can so easily see how much my friendships and relationships with a lot of my friends has done so.  It's on the one hand tragic but on the other hand just a fact of life.

Wow I really was thinking that I need some lighter-hearted posts.  Oh well.

So here's my quote, tell me what you think.



> True friends do not prove themselves in the exciting moments of life.  Hardships and joyous occasions are not where they're found.

No, the proving ground of a true friend is in the mundane and dull moments of the everyday life.
-Derek Wong



Well I've actually thought about this before, but I had never gotten around to find out whether or not someone else has said it before I have.  As usual, someone probably did.  But it'd take too long to try to find and properly give them credit.  So if someone else happens upon it, I'll gladly give someone else the credit.

Basically all I mean is that it's so easy to feel close to people when they're going through things that are interesting.  But life consists of only a few of those moments.  It's so much nicer to have friends and people around you that actually want to hear about the days when life isn't as exciting or exceptionally interesting.  I feel like I've said that before, but it must have been in conversation rather than on my blog.  Granted it's even better to just be interesting all of the time, but I digress.
