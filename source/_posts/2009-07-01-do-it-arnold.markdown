The whole situation with the California budget crisis is ridiculous.  It is looking very likely that [California will have to issue IOUs](http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE55T7E120090630) as the new fiscal year rolls around.  How did we get into this pickle?  The recession!  The decreased revenue from falling property taxes and lack of state income taxes from those who are not working has left the Golden State in a huge predicament.  $24.3 BILLION??  That is ridiculous.

In the special election on May 19, 2009, the people of this state voted against the increased taxes that were proposed.  I am a fairly modest supporter of our [Governator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger) as he is standing against the tide.  I agree with his observation that the people of California are sick and tired of living in the most taxed state of the United States of America!  Even though he has not always been my favorite politician (really who is?), I am glad that he is attempting to stand for what he thinks that the people want.

Democratic state politicians on the other hard are, inexplicably, ridiculous.  While they, too, are trying to stand for what they think that the people want, they are doing it in a way that is illogical.  From trying to find loopholes to pass the budget with a simple majority (since they can't pass what they want without Republican support) to trying to pass tax increases along with budget cuts, they are not making the process extremely difficult.  They are still trying to get theirs while seeming to not understand what basic tasks they need to do in order to get the state's finances in order.

Let us put it simply: California **needs** to cut its costs.  It doesn't have the money and at this point it is not reasonable to increase the taxes that it imposes on its population.  At some point people are going to get tired of paying so much for the privilege of wonderful weather (and horrible smog).  I wonder if the politicians know this.  Maybe good old Mr. Olympia himself knows.
