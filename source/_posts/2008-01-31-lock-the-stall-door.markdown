There are some things that happen in life that cause you to become speechless.  For some, this happens more often than for others.  For me, it just happened.  What in the world do you say when you walk into a stall and someone is sitting on the toilet doing their business?

Wait a second, something is not right.  Oh yeah, I'm not supposed to go into a stall when another person is already in there.





  1. "You forgot to lock the door, you ninny."


  2. "Surprise!  I'm here!"


  3. "How are those TPS reports going?"


  4. "Ah ha, THAT'S where the smell was coming from!"


  5. "How's that crossword puzzle going for you?"


  6. "Whoa...you know that's not normal."


  7. "Room in here for another?"



Really, how do you respond to that?  You can't.  You're speechless.  This is one for the scrapbook (i.e. the blog).  It's even better when this person is from work and you see them around but don't actually know them.  Super!
