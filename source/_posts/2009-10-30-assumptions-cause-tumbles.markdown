While I am happy about the fact that I have become someone who questions a lot of what I hear, I readily admit that we all need to live using assumptions.  We do not check every fact each and every time otherwise we would go insane!  We sit on chairs without checking that the legs will support our weight (although sometimes the chair unfortunately does not support our weight).  We figure that our car engine is going to work even though we don't check it before turning it on everyday.  Staplers have staples, light switches will turn on lights, and our e-mail is accessible.  These assumptions are slight and imperceptible things that we do.  When the assumption does not hold, it is quickly discarded to handle the exceptional case.

But then there assumptions that have a more costly result.  When you and your teammate assume that the other is going to catch the fly ball, you could lose the game.  Perhaps you and another drive make an assumption that the other is going to get out of the way and an accident occurs.  At work, if no definitive statement is made about who is to carry out a task then all involved will think that the other is doing it.  Or in the tragedy of [Kitty Genovese](http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/scraig/gansberg.html) everyone assumes that someone else will do the right thing.  Or infinitely increasing in the depth of tragedy, what happens to someone who assumes that scientists and public opinion are correct enough that Jesus is _not_ the answer?

Let us not assume!  Especially when it comes to the important things.  Else we are complicit in the outcome, whatever that might be.
