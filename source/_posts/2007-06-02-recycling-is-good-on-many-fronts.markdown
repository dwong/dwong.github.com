I'm not sure how many people actually recycle their goods.  Aluminum cans, glass bottles, plastic bottles, and more can all be recycled.  I know that this is not true everywhere, but here in California you actually have to put a cash deposit down on every single item when you pay for it.  So when you recycle the item (whether it be plastic or aluminum or whatever) you are actually only getting back your deposit.  Somehow I think that if everyone knew this, then there would be more recycling going on.

In any case, I'd like to share a tip for recycling on your own.  As you very well know, you don't have to actually return cans in order to be recycling.  You could also be recycling by using things for multiple purposes.  A sample case would be the following tip:

Next time you go grocery shopping (after using [the grocery pricer](http://prices.goingthewongway.com/) to check that you're going to buy things at a good price, of course) you should choose to ask for plastic one time and paper the next.  At home, take the paper bag and place it inside of the plastic one.  Unfold the paper bag so that it is now simply its original size with the plastic bag on the outside of it.  Place your trash in this bag and when full throw the entire thing away.  This is useful because the paper will be able to hold the majority of the weight while the plastic ensures that no leaking will happen.  By using this method, you are going to save yourself some cost for "trash bags" while also recycling the bags that you've gotten from the grocery store!

I don't actually know if this is a well-known thing to do.  Maybe it is, and I'm just unaware.  In any case I'd like those that don't know to be able to do this as well.  

Oh I just thought of another tip that I heard from someone.  After you're done with your toothbrush (if you still use the traditional manual one) then you can use that in your cleaning around the house!  If toothbrushes are designed to get rid of the nasty plaque on your teeth, then don't you think that they'll be good at cleaning any kind of gunk that you can throw at it?

Alright and coincidentally I just read about some tips for different uses for everyday household things.  I like the [different uses for dryer sheets](http://www.realsimple.com/realsimple/gallery/0,21863,1030084-5,00.html), but you can check out the tips for all 10 items featured.

In any case, recycling is not hard, it's good for both the environment and society, and it's good for you!  So take the opportunity and happy recycling!
