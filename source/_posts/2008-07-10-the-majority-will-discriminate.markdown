Discrimination isn't great.  That much is obvious to most people.

Isn't it strange, then, that it seems like most people will indeed discriminate against others if they are in the majority?  That is, people that might be discriminated against for whatever reason in one location will discriminate others when they're somewhere else.

What is within man that we do such things?  Is it egocentricity?  Original sin?
