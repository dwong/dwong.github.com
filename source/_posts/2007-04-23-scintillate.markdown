Okay so I actually this that this is interesting because I looked up the word before I posted it, and it seemed like a slightly different definition than I expected.  It makes sense for scintillate to mean to emit sparks, but for most of the times that I've encountered it, it has been used more metaphorically.  There is the usage in terms of sparks as between lovers.  And there is the usage for someone who is very witty and quick.  Hm, I guess we all learn something everyday, don't we?
