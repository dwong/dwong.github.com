Now passing judgment on people is not always good as we all know.  Of course people nowadays want there to be no judgments whatsoever.  And let's be honest, that doesn't really make any sense at all.  It makes about as much sense as getting rid of the court system, doesn't it?  

Well I saw something today, and it is a case that definitely makes me think about some judgment passing.

Now far be it from me to know if someone actually understands what it means to be a Christian.  But I have to wonder about it when I see a sign on the street that proclaims that they should come to church in order to win a car.  They direct you to their website where they have [a page dedicated to their contest](http://www.ineedarevolution.com/easter/).  

To me, that seems outlandish where they feel that they have a need to offer people physical prizes in order to attract them to come to their church.  Some out there will say that it's a good thing to get people into church no matter how they got there.  But is that really the right attitude?  

Seems ridiculous to me, and I hope that this is not a growing trend.
