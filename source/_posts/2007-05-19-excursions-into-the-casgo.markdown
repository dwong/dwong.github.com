Enter the majestic gates.
Or rather, the opening beneath the rolling warehouse door.
Let them greet you as you flash your pass.
Could you want anything more?

Try out the little goodies all around.
Different tastes offer themselves to you.
The sweet and the salty, the bread and meat.
All mixed in your stomach like some strange stew.

What will you do when the crowd confronts you?
You seem overwhelmed and help from who?
Nobody cares about you and your posse.
Oh look the pirate child to the rescue!

He has a sword on his little belt.
And a fearsome glow within his eyes.
His hand is at the ready,
But possibly if his Popsicle is taken he cries.

The cheese! The cheese!
Oh so much cheese!
You want to eat more?
Well then just say please.

Bring your riches, then you may pass.
I see the light, oh yonder ho!
There is just one standing in our way.
She then says, "thank you for coming to Casgo."
