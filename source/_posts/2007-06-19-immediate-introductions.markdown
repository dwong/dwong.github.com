Meeting new people is a fact of life.  However, have you ever met someone after you initially saw them and recognized them?  Now I might be the only one, but I doubt it.  I'm not strange enough to be completely alone here.

In any case, I've realized something that I think that we would all do well to know.  Not meeting someone initially creates an awkward environment.  After you've already seen them and come to recognize them without having actually met them is a situation in which both of you know that the other exists, but neither of you feel comfortable talking to the other.  Not having an introduction can come about in a variety of ways:




  1. Someone didn't do their duty when they know both of you and introduced you.


  2. You are both slightly uncomfortable with meeting strangers.


  3. Somehow you already know about the other person, but you know that they have no idea who you are.  That makes you afraid to approach them.


Okay I'm sure that there are more ways that this can happen.  However it came about, if it happens to you you should know that the longer you wait to talk and/or meet the other person, the more strange it will be when you actually do.  So just go for it and introduce yourself.  Remember that they might feel just as strange about without knowing your name while seeing you in the halls.  Or in a group of people.  Or around the neighborhood.  Or living right next door to you.

The only thing that you have to do after that is not forget that you met them.  Because the other person likely did not forget.  And then they'll know that you didn't care to remember your name.  Or even that they met you.

Meet 'em early, not often.
