Farmers have used branding for a long time as a way to mark their property, namely their livestock.  They knew that if their livestock wandered off (as they invariably would) then they needed a way to make sure that they had a way to get their property back.  It was a wonderful idea for the farmers.  But what did the livestock think?  I am sure that the livestock were not huge fans of the process.  Having a hot metal brand pressed into their skin was probably not on their list of highlights from their lives.  But they didn't have a choice.

[Apple stickers](http://www.goingthewongway.com/179/applegeeks-coachgirls/) on cars, Gucci emblems on purses ([real or fake](http://www.goingthewongway.com/70/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/)), and perhaps even soccer jerseys with their large corporate sponsorship logos are all things that seem to follow this idea.  It's a strange idea really because we are paying companies so that we can advertise for them.  If I walked up to you and asked if you would pay me money in order to wear a necklace with my name on it you would think that I am crazy.  Is the idea that we would pay to display companies' logos that far off from this example?

Nowadays people have a choice.  And I am always surprised when people  choose self-branding.  Instead of viewing it as branding, though, they want to display an affiliation, love the cachet/exclusivity, or perhaps just do it because  others do it also.

In truth, we all do it to some degree.  We buy T-shirts, computers, and cars that all have logos on them.  So I would doubt very much if anyone is exempt.  But thinking about it sure does make one think.  And it sure does give me a different perspective of "brand" names.
