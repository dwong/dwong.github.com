Crom bought a new hybrid vehicle approximately 1 year ago.  When he bought it I could not help but overhear him proclaiming its merits.  He talked about how it had all of the latest gadgets, of which I believe the only one that I actually heard him specifically mention was the Bluetooth.  The same song came out of his mouth for the whole week.  Not a big deal.  Everyone gets excited when we get a new possession, right?  Lately I doubt that he has been as excited about it.  It's a Toyota after all.

After a year of owning the car, he still does not have license plates on it.  It appears to those who do not know that it is a new car.  When I noticed that this was happening (it's hard not to notice after a few months) I was very curious as to why someone would want to do this.  My pondering led me to the following:




  1. The license plates that he received were 6BAD666, 1SAD120, etc or which he otherwise found offensive.


  2. He is in love with the dealer that sold him his vehicle


  3. Now he has the ability to run red lights or drive toll roads without paying


  4. He desires to remain as unique as possible (i.e., a recently purchased Toyota)


  5. He actually purchases a new model of the same car every couple of months


  6. The Department of Motor Vehicles has made its first ever mistake



I am of a mind to tear his precious new car papers just to see what happens.  Or maybe just draw a happy face with a Sharpie marker.
