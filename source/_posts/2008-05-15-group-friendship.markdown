When I think of friendship, I initially think of a relationship between one person and another.  They can be all sorts of combination of guys and girls (okay so really there are only 4 combinations if there are 2 people involved).  But have you noticed how different everything is when a group is involved?

Imagine, if you will, going into a situation where you're trying to get in with a whole group of people.  Individually you are able to interact pretty well with them.  Conversation is pretty easy, common ground is found, life is good.  

But as a whole when you're with them things are not well.  You are left standing there thinking, "What am I doing here?"  You don't follow their inside jokes.  And you definitely haven't known them for as long as they have known each other.

Why the difference?  It seems strange to me to be able to be friends with them individually but have trouble with them when they are all a group.  But it happens.  Related to mob mentality?  Who knows, you got me.
