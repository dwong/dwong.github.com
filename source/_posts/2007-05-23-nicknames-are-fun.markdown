I like nicknames. I like giving them to all types of people. I've found that it helps to break many initial layers of ice that might exist when you're first getting to know people. The real key, in my opinion, to nicknames is that they create a bond between the person with the nickname and others.

I guess that there are also different types of nicknames. I don't mean derogatory, kind, or funny. I mean there are nicknames that everyone calls someone by and then there are nicknames that only exist between the nickname giver and the nickname recipient. I like the latter.

Instead of discussing all of the nicknames that I've given, though, I'd like to now list all of the ones that I've received. The interesting list includes:

  * **JQ** - _It stands for Johnny Quest. I don't even know why I got it.___
  * **T-man** - _This is actually a funny story. So in college I met a couple of girls at an event. And then I met them again. And again. And finally one time when they asked me what my name was, I got tired of it so I just told them it was Mr. T. As in the A-team guy with the gold chains. Haha and they thought to call me T-man. After that, they sure remembered who I was!_
  * **Deek** - _I don't even know why the girl who gave me this one did. I think it's pretty strange. Just like the nickname giver. :P_
  * **Darkwing** - _Okay this is a strange one because it's half given by myself. In the cartoon Darkwing Duck, the theme song has a line "when you're in trouble you call DW." So I think that someone called me Darkwing Duck when I was a little kid because of the song. And then I made up an AIM screen name using it. And then someone started using it (but only on rare occasions)._
  * **Dirk** - _I suppose that this one makes sense because of how similar it sounds to my name. If only I played like Mr. Nowitzki. Well not so much in the playoffs this year. But all of the rest of the time that'd be awesome._
  * **reDERKulous** - _I think that this is an awesome nickname. I got this nickname when someone was making them up to input as our bowler names. I appreciate the creativity, and I've used this as a screen name in video games (namely Halo 1 and 2). Of course, since I made the name I had to live up to it and truly be reDERKulous. :)_
  * **DT** - _This is an obvious one since my middle initial is T. The one who gave me this one doesn't use it too often, though._
  * **Drek** - _Another obvious one, but it shows how the giver is very unique and unlike others. Plus it just sounds amusing in her voice, like a little kid who can't entirely say a word._
  * **Derek Wong-a-long** - _I got this in high school. Haha I have no idea why. It doesn't mean anything (meaningful or perverted)._
  * **Ricardo** - _HA this one is so random. I actually don't even remember HOW the person who gave this one to me got it._
  * **junny** - _I only got this one because I made one up for this person that had to do with their Korean name. It's an amusing one, though because it is seemingly a name for a 13 year old._
  * **derekson** - _I think that the person who gave me this name just likes to append different endings to people real names to come up with a nickname._
  * **muga** - _This one was definitely in response to me giving someone the nickname "muha". Nonetheless it's an amusing one._
  * **d-d-d-d-derek** - _I don't even know how she came up with this. But she did._

Okay that is all just a sample of the different nicknames that I've received. There are definitely others (some of which I have likely forgotten forever). There are others that I'm not eager to share and have thus kept them to myself. And then there is one of my very favorite: **derekudarkwingduckingofthejungle**. Well it wins for longest, that is for sure. And it is one of the most original. My very amusing friend [Melissa Tong](http://www.xanga.com/totml715) is the very originator of this nickname. Haha how awesome is that?

Coincidentally, she would also appreciate a post about her. ;-) I hardly ever write about actual people that I know, instead prefering to focus on ideas and topics. However I will make an exception in this case (and possibly others in the future). Anyways, I realized while talking to her that something cool that she does is give people amusing nicknames! I really enjoy that her nicknames, although perhaps not stemming from an event but rather their actual name, are still original and humorous. Plus they're usually corny. And that says a lot about the person that she is. Well seeing as how I told her that someday I'd write about her, I considered many other amusing things to talk about instead of just the fact that she gives out lots of nicknames. Some of the other considered topics and quotes are more funny, but I decided to refrain on my better judgment.

All in all, nicknames are fun. I like giving them, and I like getting them. However I must admit that they require some real perseverance if you want them to stick. Oh and I don't really like mean-spirited ones because they detract from the previously mentioned bond between giver and recipient.
