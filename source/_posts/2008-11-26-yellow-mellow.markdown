Aren't bathrooms full of such interesting happenings? 

In the movie [Meet the Fockers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290002/) as Bernie Focker is giving everyone a tour of their house, he eventually gets to the bathroom.  When he's there, he tells them the rule of the house is



> If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown flush it down.
-Bernie Focker



I think that I'm working with someone who has taken that to heart.

No, scratch that.  Some of them don't even flush it down.  Decency people, decency!
