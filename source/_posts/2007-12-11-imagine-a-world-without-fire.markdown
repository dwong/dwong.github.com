Have you ever thought about how life can be different?  Well the other day I was thinking about what our world would be like without our friend fire.  And a very different world it would be.

It sure would be cold.  Haha and [Bear Grylls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Grylls) wouldn't be able to teach us that fire is so important to survive in the wild.  Hopefully he would still eat crazy things on his show, though.

But once you get past the fact that we'd all be shivering perhaps you think that it wouldn't be so bad because we could have electricity to warm us.  Electric heaters are all over the place, and they certainly do not require fire.  So we wouldn't freeze to death and perhaps people could still live in Alaska.

However, there are _many_ things that we would not have in our use.  We wouldn't be able to have:




  1. Cars - That sure would change our world, wouldn't it?  They're currently needed because gasoline engines use sparks to create a small combustion that, through a series of gears and mechanical parts, powers the wheels.  Granted I guess a spark isn't exactly fire.  However I'm assuming that we would have gotten nowhere close to a spark if we didn't have fire.


  2. Food - How in the world would we cook it?  Would we be eating lots and lots of sushi?  Maybe just raw vegetables?  How animalistic!


  3. Trains - Perhaps you don't think that losing trains is any great loss.  I mean who really rides trains nowadays anyways?  Well lest you forget, trains still carry vast amounts of goods across land.  They're often supposed to be more efficient than trucks because of their fixed rail.


  4. Swords - How will the ninjas work?  They'll be put out of a job.  But seriously, there would be no metallurgy as we know it because the metal needs to be shaped after being heated...by fire.  So kiss your katana goodbye.



Fire has got to get a mention in the race for best creation ever.  Without it we'd be a hungry bunch of people eating who knows what.  And we'd all be biking everywhere.  Well that would be a good thing because then we wouldn't be obese.  But everyone would be walking around sweaty and smelly.  And to add insult to injury, everything metal would be ugly and rough.  Put a chunk of that in your ear and see how you like it.  Makes one a little more thankful for the things that we take for granted, does it not?  Still it's kind of fun to have an imagination!
