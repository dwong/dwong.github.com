Not watercraft!

Everyone who is alive has probably gone through this.  Unless you're Paris Hilton or some other well-heeled person (perhaps even if you are), you will come across things that need to be done.  You will see dishes in the sink, clutter on the table, or tasks that need to be accomplished at work, and trash that needs to be picked up.  

In the past I have had the conscious thought that I want to be that person who will do what needs to be done.  So I work at it.  I am by no means great at it.  In fact, I am probably not even that good at it.  But I can see where I want to be.  I want to be the person doing it.

But there are so many people who do not even care.  People will say that it is not in their job description or figure that someone else is going to do it.  At times there are even people who do not see the things that need to be done because they are so intent on caring about themselves.  How revealing!

Do you think that doing what needs to get done is natural?  Today you can choose whether you want to be someone who gets it done or someone who cannot conceive of doing more than what is required.
