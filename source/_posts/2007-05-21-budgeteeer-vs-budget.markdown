Well I suppose that there aren't too many original ideas out there.  Nevertheless, when I happened upon a piece of software called [Budget](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/featured-download/allocate-your-money-in-envelopes-with-budget-262014.php)
while I was reading through my feed reader this morning, I had to take a second look.  Why?  Well because I wrote (and am in current development of) [The Budgeteer](http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/the-budgeteer/)!

There were notable differences, obviously.  Comparing the two programs, here is what I noticed:




  1. Budget deposits absolute amounts into each sub-account (represented as envelopes) whereas the Budgeteer deposits percentages into each sub-account.  I recently thought about this difference actually.  It would be nice to have options to do both/either.  My original approach of percentages allows for things such as taking 10% off the top for tithe, but it has pitfalls such as having to specify a percentage for each sub-account.  Granted of course you can play around with them over time such that they will approach what you actually need/want/use.


  2. Budget is much prettier.  Both their Windows and Mac executables look better than my Python GUI.  Granted, I haven't been trying to make it beautiful or anything.  And it is essentially the same functionality (clicking on different buttons, etc).  Nevertheless, that is a plus that Budget has.


  3. Obviously Budget is production software that is being sold whereas the Budgeteer is something that I wrote up in a week and have since played with only a little bit.  Budget also costs 30 bucks, and (when the time comes) the Budgeteer will not.


  4. The Budgeteer has a cooler name.



All in all, I would like to think that Budget and the Budgeteer are similar.  However, I must concede that they are not even close to similar.  Budget is much more polished, and I am now more determined to develop the Budgeteer!

I've changed the name of the program to Budgeteer.  I don't know why I need so many e's.
