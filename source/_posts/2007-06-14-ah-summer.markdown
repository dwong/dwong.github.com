![Summer photo CC by flickr user Storm Crypt](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1126/548495930_e714338645_o.jpg)I was never one for pro con lists. But maybe I'll start. Here is one for the season that is summer. And one caveat to this post is that must know that I live in sunny southern California, so if you live in some forsaken place then you'll just have to wish it were different for you. Or you can bask in the cons that I experience and enjoy your freezing cold. Just know this: I wouldn't trade places with you at all.

**Pro:**The sun gives us vitamin D which is needed for, among other things, calcium to be absorbed and used. It also gives you a nice healthy looking glow.
**Con:**The sun causes skin cancer. It also causes wrinkles.

**Pro:**Can make use of those expensive sunglasses.
**Con:**The reflection off of objects is sometimes glaring, especially if we forget to bring those expensive sunglasses.

**Pro:**Have more sunlight to play with (or in).
**Con:**Having nobody to play with.

**Pro:**Summer love.
**Con:**Not having anyone to love. Or more likely, having nobody to love you back.

**Pro:**Sitting out, enjoying a nice drink on the proverbial porch.
**Con:**The stupid bugs that will eat you alive.

**Pro:**Vacations to far off places.
**Con:**Not having any vacation time. Or having no job and plenty of "vacation time," but obviously having no money to vacation with.

**Pro:**Cruising in your car, looking cool.
**Con:**Not having had any rain for a long time, so your car is dirty. Your speakers are not loud enough to make anyone glance again. Your car is laughably unimpressive. You look like a fool.
