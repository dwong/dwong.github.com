I'm a little slow on this news, but one of the sites that I subscribe and read ([ProBlogger.net](http://www.problogger.net)) is having a contest to celebrate the anniversary of his blog.  You can find more details of it all at [the competition page](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/10/02/54000-worth-of-prizes-on-offer-in-the-problogger-birthday-bash-competitions/).  There are $54,000 worth of prizes to be had in a number of smaller contests (although admittedly some of the contests are already done).  Many of them are fairly easy to participate in.  

So check it out because remember: the possibility of winning is better than no possibility at all!
