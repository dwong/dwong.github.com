So there are many people out there who watch this show.  I would just like to say that I am both disappointed and satisfied with it this week.  I actually don't like watching the results show because I think that it's a bit of a waste of time to convey the results in an hour long (or whatever length it is) show.  They use music and dramatic lighting to manufacture something out of nothing, and it is thoroughly annoying.

I thought that Jared was good.  He sounded like Marvin Gaye!  I thought that Sanjaya kid should definitely have been voted off.  He annoys me.  I think it'd be cool if they had 2 numbers for each contestant, one for voting "for" and one for voting "against".  They could take the result of that and use it.

At the same time I'm glad that Antonella got voted off even though she might have had some questionable photos posted online (which made her a huge topic of search on the Internet).  It proves that there is some decency to the singing aspect of the show (because she was frankly not that great).

I kind of wonder what happens with these people when they return back from American Idol.  Do they just become another "one of us" who has had their 15 minutes of fame?  Or do any of them actually get to do something related to singing?  I'm thinking that some of these people will revel in their temporary spotlight and always bring it up as they're becoming a lounge singer or something.  And then there will be (there have to be) some that still aspire for more and end up "making it" in some other way (be it a band or a contract or whatever).
