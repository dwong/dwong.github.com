So I parked in the garage in a slightly different spot on President's Day since it was rather empty.  There were a number of spots open that usually are not available when I arrive at work because so many people got to sleep in.  Anyways, so I park next to a wall, and what do I see?  None other than my name (spelled like I spell it) written on the wall!

How freaky is that?  Excuse me while I go find out if someone is stalking me.  If that's you, can you kindly let me know?  Thanks a bunch.
