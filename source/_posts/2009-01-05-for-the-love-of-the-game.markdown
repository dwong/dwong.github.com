I do enjoy myself some National Basketball Association.  The [Los Angeles Lakers](http://www.nba.com/lakers/) have been doing fairly well, and I must say that I'm happy about that.  If you're wondering, I'm not a band wagon fan unlike many other people in southern California!

Sometimes, though, I stop and think about the marketing for the NBA.  "I love this game"??  Yeah, I'm sure that they love it so much.  But what if they weren't getting paid millions of dollars to play it?  What if they only made the [average salary of an American in 2007](http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/012528.html), which is $50,233?  Okay let's be generous and just go with an even $100,000.  I doubt that we would get the talent that we have now because people wouldn't devote their entire lives to getting better at the sport.  Parents would force their kids to go through endless numbers of camps and drills in order to just get that perfect arc on their shot.  They definitely wouldn't spend every moment of the day in a gym.  Well at least not the majority of them.  I'm sure that some of them would still work just as hard because they really do love the game.  But I'm sure that some of them would have to pursue other more lucrative careers that they could be successful at (such as rapping or investment banking).

Love the game?  Yeah, not so much.

How is it that we live in a world where the player of a game (which I admittedly enjoy watching and participating in) can make many many times the amount of money of someone who is saving lives as a fireman?  Or putting their lives on the line as policemen.  Or helping the downtrodden.  Money sure isn't a direct correlation to importance in the grand scheme of things, is it?

How inequitable!  But what else can I expect from a world tainted by sin?
  *[NBA]: National Basketball Association, I thought that I already said that!
