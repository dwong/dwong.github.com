When I'm driving around, I definitely notice when someone has Christian paraphernalia on their vehicle.  This can range anywhere from a fish emblem to the more clever slogans to mysterious symbols that are a little more difficult to deduce.  While I probably like seeing their proclamations of faith more than [other things](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/11/sell-your-porsche/), it can still lead to pretty interesting results.

A little while back I saw a van in and around Los Angeles, CA with the slogan: **_God's way is the best way_**

The van was for a company that cleaned carpets named Best Way Carpet Clean.  In addition to the above slogan, they also had some fish stickers on their van.  Oh and there was a website listed on the van, but it seemed to be out of commission when I tried to access it.  

In any case, what is the real motivation for them to put that on their van?  Seems to me that it is either because they hope:





  1. It will get them business because people are Christian and they'll trust another Christian


  2. Non-Christians will think that Christians are more trustworthy so they'll be hired



Whatever the reason, it seems to me that unless they made a special deal with God to miraculously clean carpets for them, it doesn't have too much of a place in that environment.  Not on their work van.  As it is, it just seems like a ploy to get more business and hence make more money.  

Lesson is: be a Christian anywhere (even [as a rapper](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/29/christian-rap/)), but don't do it out of incorrect motives.  Even if we can't figure it out, someone already knows when you have false intentions (where that someone is God).
