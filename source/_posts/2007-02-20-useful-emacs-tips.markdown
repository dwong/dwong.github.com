[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

These Emacs tips might be useful to somebody out there.  And at the very least it will provide me with a place to look up things that I have already searched for before.  Now that I look at them, they seem rather rudimentary but far be it from me to keep something that I found useful from others.






  * (I've been trying to figure this one out for awhile.)  To search for a string from one buffer in another buffer: 

    1. **C-w** (or **M-w**) the search string
    2. move to the buffer to search in
    3. **C-s**
    4. **M-y**





  * 
  Synchronized scrolling: **M-x scroll-all-mode**
  
    * Scroll other window:
    
      * **M-C-v** scrolls down

          
      * **M-C-V** scrolls up

    
  





  * 
Repeat a command numerous times: **M-(number) (command)** where you fill in (number) with a number and (command) with the command that you want to repeat.  To use a number that is not a single digit you hold **M** while pressing the first number and then release **M** while pressing the rest of the numbers.  An example: to kill 10 lines you would do: **M-1 0 C-k**.



 


Notes: 
**M** is the Meta key (usually Alt or Esc depending on your operating system/settings)
**C** is the Control key


Emacs can be great if you know how to use it.  :)
