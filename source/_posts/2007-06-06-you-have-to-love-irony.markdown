Well I saw something the other day that struck me as ironic.  It was a car with many bumper stickers.  Now that in and of itself is not necessary ironic.  (Unless of course you're driving a nice car with ugly stickers on it as I commented in [Sell Your Porsche](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/11/sell-your-porsche/).)  But there was a bumper sticker of an Israeli flag, and there was a license plate frame that was from [Hillcrest Christian School](http://www.hillcrestcs.org/).  How does that work?  

You know, I could very well be wrong because it might not be that ironic after all.  They could just be [Jews for Jesus](http://www.jewsforjesus.org/).  And that would be quite nice.  I would have liked to have met them.
