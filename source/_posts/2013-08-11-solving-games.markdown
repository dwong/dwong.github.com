I enjoy games.  As with many people, I find that they're a fun diversion from life.  We can quickly escape into a world where the only goal is getting a particular roll of the die or win a particular competition.  

In the beginning, we just try to understand the rules of the game.  As we progress, though, we start to naturally get better at them.  We figure out optimal ways to accomplish whatever task it is that we're trying to do.  That's good, but sometimes we want to get there faster than through simple experience.  This entails looking up tips and tricks.  In previous times, we would have to read books or ask people to help with this.  Nowadays there are all kinds of options for getting better at the games that we play.  This can range anywhere from reading the daily newspaper for scenarios about [bridge](http://go.gtww.net/17hUTgu) to watching [ESPN](http://go.gtww.net/13cKgyd) for the World Poker Tour to checking out [ballsupbingo](http://ballsupbingo.com/) for bingo.

However we get there, I am all in favor of more games!  Exercise your mind, try something new, and make friends doing it.  How much better can it get?
