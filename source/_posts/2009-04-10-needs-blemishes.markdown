When something is too good everyone thinks that something is wrong.  A little while back I made a T-shirt, and it surprisingly turned out decently.  Considering that I am not very artistic, it was rather miraculous that the lines were straight and the overall presentation was just fine.  However, the most interesting thing that I found was that people that saw it did not realize that I did it freehand.  Since the lines were straight and everything looked good, there were some that just thought that I used a stencil while other people did not even realize that I had made the shirt!

It is easy and natural for people to only believe something if they can see the flaw in it.  Else they will think that something is amiss (e.g., a machine made the product and you are trying to pass it off as your own work).  Most of the time this is spot-on.  People are imperfect.  Everyone knows this.  Why else would we need Jesus?  Still it's rather amusing to note that while people can assume that perfection in other people is acceptable, perfection is a piece of handiwork is odd.

Sing on it Nat King Cole (_Mona Lisa_).
