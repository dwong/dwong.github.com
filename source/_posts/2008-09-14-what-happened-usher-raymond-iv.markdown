Can I just say after watching the music videos for Usher's songs [Love In This Club](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqqY07OZWps) and [Moving Mountains](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64EjuSEXsYg) that I think that he is like R. Kelly (aka certifiably crazy)?  Please, does anyone remember R. Kelly's Trapped In The Closet series?

On the one hand, I'm laughing hysterically.  But on the other this is just out of hand.

Edit: Must be because of their collaboration on [Same Girl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlqdxZcgnZg)
