[**kas**-ti-geyt]


#### Definition:


To strongly criticize or reprimand.



#### Example of usage:


After running into the street, some people think that the parents should just send them to the corner, but others are of the mind that the child should be castigated in order to more strongly deter future injurious behavior.



#### Comments:


Using a new word instead of criticize seems like an attractive possibility.  Seemingly of the old English variety of words, it flavors your language, and I'd warrant to say that it might make you sound more sophisticated.
