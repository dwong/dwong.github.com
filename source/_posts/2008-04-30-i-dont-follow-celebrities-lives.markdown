How many people do you know who are more interested and involved in the lives of celebrities than in the lives of those around them?  Too many?  Yeah, me too.



#### Who Are They?


In the realm of entertainment, there are actors, musicians, athletes, and people who are nothing else except somehow rich.  They all come together at events, walk around the same streets that we do, and have lives that occasionally defy soap operas in their outrageousness.  But why are there people who don't personally know the celebrities interested in them at all?  Is it because they seem to belong to a higher social caste than we?  Is it because they are prettier, richer, and more talented than us?  Is it because they do things that we wouldn't even dream of doing?



#### My Thoughts


Really I just don't know why us common folk are interested in them.  All I know is that I see people all over the place who are far more interested in celebrities (who they do not know) than in their friends and family (who they do know).  Something doesn't seem right about that does it?

I really don't think that celebrities are that interesting.  I respect their talent, and I'm definitely not opposed to entertainment.  But I don't care what kind of a drink they ordered at Starbucks last Wednesday or who was seen schmoozing with who at the hot club in Las Vegas.  Nor do I care to use any of my brain to remember any other unnecessarily small fact about them.  What kind of a world do we live in where we know the favorite candy of a star and don't even know what is really going on with the guy right next to us?

It's time to stop immersing ourselves in others' lives and time to start living our own!  (Or at least immerse yourself in someone's life who knows that you exist.  Who knows, something worthwhile might even come out of it.)
