As many are apt to do, I feel like thinking about time as the new year is changing over.  It's interesting how time passes.  In some ways it passes so quickly and things are so different now compared to a year ago.  And in others, it was only a year.

It's not just a year that changes things.  Even a moment has the power to affect a life.  Maybe if I remember that each moment has that much power, the passage of years will be orders of magnitude easier.
