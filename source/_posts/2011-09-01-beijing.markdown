Beijing is well-known in recent history for hosting the 2008 Olympics.  It is very populous.  On another note it apparently is a hugely popular destination for Chinese people from other parts of China.  They were everywhere, and it was not that pleasant to be around them all of the time.  Yeah, that part I just loved.
