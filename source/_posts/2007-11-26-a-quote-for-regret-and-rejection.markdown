Sometimes we have to choose our poison, don't we?  It's not always blue pill or red pill, sometimes it's bad and worse.  In any case, I feel like I must have heard this quote, but I can't seem to find its source online.  I think that it's pretty good, what do you think?



> Regret is 10 times worse than rejection.
-Derek Wong



For some reason in my head the quote actually is "100 times," but I think that's an exaggeration.  I'm more comfortable with 10 times.  So if nobody has made this quote, and I actually did make up this quote then that's just fine with me.  And if someone did say this, let me know so that I can give due credit.

I'd venture to guess that many people choose regret simply because it is the easier of the two.  Rejection is a pain that we all know and despise.  It hurts us upfront and in the short term quite a lot.  On the other hand regret takes some time to fester and build up its power.  And it's a longer term pain to boot.  No thanks.
