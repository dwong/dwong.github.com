I don't really find it too difficult that people can easily say one thing while doing another.  While [everyone thinks that they're right](http://www.goingthewongway.com/5/algorithm-for-your-life/), it seems like it's getting easier (in this increasingly relativistic society) for people to change their mind after committing.  They think that they're right even when they go back on what they have previously said.  They just rationalize away the facts.


> A man is only as good as his word


This saying is often used, and it is one that has stuck with me over the years.  Let's face it, nobody appreciates someone who backpedals when the going gets tough.  Neither friends, family, or employer will ever enjoy someone whose word is unreliable.

If you find that you're in an un[tenable](http://www.goingthewongway.com/142/tenable/) position because you overextended, perhaps you should have thought about it before you extended.  When you are out there, you have to deal with the consequences.  Next time remember to calculate the cost before giving your word.  You just might be a better man (or woman, obviously) for it.  

It seems like it is time to man up.
