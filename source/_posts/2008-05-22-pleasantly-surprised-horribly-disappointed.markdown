Expectations.  We have them about all kinds of things.  Sometimes we base them on our experiences, but more often we seem to base them on our hopes and dreams.  We can have them about things like birthdays, get-togethers, and other events.  In our mind's eye we see people being caring and loving, friendly and jolly.  It's not always so, is it?

But besides that, we can even have expectations about much more concrete matters.  When we sit in the chair, we have that dreamy expectation that the chair will hold up our weight.  If that expectation isn't met, we sure aren't too happy!  And so it goes moment by moment with all sorts of things that we encounter.

More recently I've noticed how much people do this with things that they don't understand.  Or rather, I've noticed how this comes into play when people are dealing with those things that most of us do not fully understand.  Things like televisions, computer programs, and automobiles will all sorely disappoint us when we expect them to work and they do not.  But when we don't know what to expect, and things work how happy are we?  

When we try out a shortcut key and find that some programmer has made sure that shortcut key works aren't we pleasantly surprised?  Or when we go to a website, make a guess at what to do, aren't we glad for whoever made it work just so?  

I emphasize the computer software, but it's obviously more.
