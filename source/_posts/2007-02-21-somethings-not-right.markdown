What would you think?

If you were in Irvine, CA, USA at approximately 9:05 AM on February 21, 2007, and you saw a man of Chinese origin approximately 5' 11", 180 pounds walking from the parking structure to his building, what would you think?  You wouldn't think too much since he was dressed in a business casual manner so he fit in with the corporate surroundings.  But wait!  Something isn't quite right...ah yes there it is...  He is wearing a brown shoe on his right foot and a black one on his left.  Ah you see him scurrying back to his car as he realizes his mistake.  You might later discover that he keeps his shoes in his truck because he only wears them for work (and wears some [Sierra Browns](http://rainbowsandals.com/zzPremierLeathers.asp#Double%20Layer%20Arch,%20Premier%20Leather) for all of the time up to and after he absolutely has to put his shoes on).  Additionally, that particular morning he decided to just put his shoes on while sitting in the front seat.  Unfortunately it was rather dark in the parking structure (as many such structures can be) and he simply reached back to grab his shoes while continuing to listen to [his music](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JJ5B?ie=UTF8&tag=dereksxanga-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00006JJ5B).  He even tried to hold them up to check them after he grabbed them, but seeing as the light was very dim would be unable to differentiate between dark colors (such as say brown and black).  Even as he put them on he thought that the laces felt different but in his own silly manner he didn't bother to look at them when in better light.  And thus goes another day in his life.  A small glimmer of amusement.

So what would you think?  (It is verifiable this author would laugh his head off at such a creature.)
