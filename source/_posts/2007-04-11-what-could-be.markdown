Have you been [Dancing With The Stars](http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancingwiththestars/index)?
I'd rather travel to Mars.
Oh how fun that'd be!
Perhaps instead I'll cross the sea.
To the tropical vacation of fame
Maybe there find a classic dame?
Or maybe win a trip to the country of my roots.
Where I could buy some nice designer boots
Or more likely a fake designer bag.
Oh but veritably on the U.S. market that is a drag.
I don't agree with the ways of fakes.
But I like to eat lots at classic old bakes
Or barbecue meets for that matter!
Brazilian versions might make you fatter.
Work it off by learning to dance.
Get on Dancing With The Stars? Not a chance!
Or instead of all of that, you can sit in your house.
But if a fire comes, with water you will douse.
Those wood fences are ideal but trouble.
Especially if the fire bursts your bubble!
Perhaps the answer is a fence not wood.
Something different to put up in your neighborhood.
I've heard of vinyl fences, they might be it.
Now I'm tired of doing this rhyming bit.
So take it or leave it, your life or this one.
Whatever the case, right now I am done!
