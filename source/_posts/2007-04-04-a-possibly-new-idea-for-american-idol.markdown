So I'm not sure if it is indeed a new idea, but I recently have been thinking that I'd like the producers of [American Idol](http://www.americanidol.com/) to consider a new idea.  After watching the show tonight as well as thinking about [extreme measures to vote certain contestants](http://www.myspace.com/starvationforsanjaya).  My idea is they should implement a new system for their voting.

They need to allow for the ability to eliminate the bad people, not **just** vote for the best.  The bad thing about the current system is that you get people like [Sanjaya Malakar](http://www.americanidol.com/contestants/season6/sanjaya_malakar/) who lots and lots of people want off, but can't _really_ do anything about it except starve.

To allow for this, it would be so simple for the producers to modify.  They would add another phone number for each contestant that would be to vote against a particular person.  Then they could simply subtract the negative votes from the positive votes.  I don't see how this could possibly be a bad thing for the show.  I still think that the best person will end up winning.  And just like the current system, a very large group of people still have the ability to circumvent the system if they're organized and thorough.  It seems like a good idea to me.  But a lot of things have seemed like a good idea to me so that's nothing new.

However if they implemented it, I know that I'd be calling to vote off Sanjaya.  And I don't even call at all now.
