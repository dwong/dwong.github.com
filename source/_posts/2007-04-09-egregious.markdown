[i-**gree**-j_uh_ s, -jee-_uh_ s]


#### Definition:


Extreme or monumental in some negative way.



#### Example of usage:


Now some people will forget things on their vacation, but forgetting your credit card and money is an egregious mistake.



#### Comments:


I think that this word is pretty useful in everyday language.  Now we might not necessarily encounter things that can be termed "egregious"  every single day.  However, it can be useful in order to reference things that could possibly happen or that have happened previously.
