In an article at Yahoo! about [cracking down on college music pirates](http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/43610153), I read about one Sarah Barg, a sophomore from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  It portrayed her as a girl who was just taking part in what everyone else was doing.  The article wanted to put her in the role of one who is definitely not the worst (I mean she _only_ downloaded 381 songs when others were downloading thousands!).  In response to it all, Barg says


> Obviously I knew it was illegal, but no one got in trouble for it



Now, I know that all higher education is not equal.  And I know that maybe not all of them are as good as the [University of California, San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/), but that does not allow for such ridiculous thoughts.  I think that ignorance is not a good excuse for doing wrong.  The onus is on you to do what's right.  However, I think that actually knowing that something is wrong and yet still doing it speaks of some darker black.  

In any case, I don't think that it's a matter of intelligence.  I think it's a sign of the times.  

Piracy does not just affect music as I wrote in [Even Worse Than At First Glance](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/14/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/), [Cheain' Chinese](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/04/cheatin-chinese/), and (in regards to cheating in general) [Cheaters 4 Life](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/).  Wow I did not realize that I had so many entries devoted to ranting about cheaters!  But I digress.

Reasons why you shouldn't be a (music) pirate:




  1. You can afford the music (or whatever it is that you're pirating).


    * If you can't afford it, you don't need it.


    * If you really can't afford it, you have things that you should be doing other than listening to music anyways.



  2. You can support and encourage the artists that you like to keep making music.  It's kind of like writing a blog and getting encouraged by people leaving comments.  Except for them it's people giving them money.  I'm applying my energy to the wrong thing.  :P


  3. You know it's morally wrong.


  4. It's actually against the law.



Now I admit that I'm not perfect, but I would like to think that once I knew the truth then I would change my behavior to match what I know.  Not everyone is like this.  But they should be.  It just makes sense to have your behavior in line with your opinions, does it not?  Don't be the person who gets laughed at for coming off as stupid.  Nobody wants 15 minutes of infamy.
