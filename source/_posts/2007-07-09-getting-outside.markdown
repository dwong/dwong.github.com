So as someone who is inside of the office everyday, it is quite rare to get to experience what many people do on a day-to-day basis.  And that is getting to be outside of a building.

I'm a software engineer, whatever that means.  Well I know what that means, but you don't really care about it anyways.  In any case that means that I spend much of my day sitting in a chair in front of a computer.  There are some good and bad things about this.

**Good**: Don't waste too much energy, not difficult physically.
**Bad**: Can easily take in more calories than output which leads to fatness and an unhealthy lifestyle.  Additionally, muscles can slowly atrophy such that when presented with a life or death situation where you need to grab onto a bar and hold up both you and your loved ones with one arm, you will all fall to an untimely demise.

**Good**: Do something that you enjoy - problem solving, thinking logically about solutions to somewhat concrete (but not real concrete) problems.
**Bad**: Get lazy and don't experience the other many many other good things in life.

**Good**: Don't get sunburned, don't get skin cancer.
**Bad**: Look like a pale alien unless you actually go out.  However, due to being inside and being so pale it would be even easier to get sunburned if sunscreen is forgotten.

All in all, I don't want to be that person that is always inside and becomes lazy.  Good thing for trees that overgrow their boundaries and require chopping!

Oh yeah I was outside over the weekend cutting branches off of trees that were touching the roof.  And you know what?  It wasn't too bad.  I felt like a woodsman.  It's not going to be a job of mine anytime soon, but I don't mind finding a little Paul Bunyan in me.
