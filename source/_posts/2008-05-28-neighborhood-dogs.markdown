Say you're taking a nice afternoon run.  You're on the home stretch, and you're trying to kick out the last of the run.  Then all of a sudden you look back and there's a dog weighing perhaps 75 pounds running at you and barking.  You had just seen the owner go into their house to put something away and nobody was around.  

What would you do?





  1. Try to outrun it


  2. Squat down and receive it with arms open wide, all the while oohing and ahhing at the cuteness of it all


  3. Yell like a madman for help


  4. Cover your crotch with one hand and hope for the best


  5. Cry like a baby


  6. Play with it


  7. Fight it



Yeah I can't even think of any other possibilities.  Tell me what you'd do, guess what I did, and then check out [the next page](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/05/28/neighborhood-dogs/2/) for a fun picture.

Yep, covered up and hoped for the best.  I think that all things considered, I came out alright.
