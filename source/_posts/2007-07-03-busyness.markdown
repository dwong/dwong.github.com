You, the one with the Bluetooth headset in your ear.  You, doing anything you can to get a few more car lengths ahead on your commute.  You, with your way of filling up every second of your time.

So you're too busy for me (not to mention those in your life who care about you)?  Even though it's actually difficult not to do at all, it's fairly bothersome when someone thinks that they are inherently more important than everyone else.  

Get over it, you're not that special.
