Now it's generally understood that eating breakfast is a good thing for you.  It gets you going in the morning by providing energy, and this in turn gets your body's metabolism to change from its "sleep" mode to its "day" mode.  And that's good for you because the more energy you burn the more food you can consume.  So you are essentially burning calories simply by being awake rather than having to work them off through exercise.  Granted you're not going to lose all of your excess weight, but it does help.

What I like to do is break my fast twice.  I'd like to think that it gives me double the benefits, but I am probably completely wrong about that.  That'd just be another case of justifying my actions.  So I get up in the morning and mosey my way on downstairs.  I eat a bowl of [Honey Bunches of Oats](http://www.kraftfoods.com/PostCereals/hbo.htm) with some fresh fruit (either bananas (cheap from [Costco](http://www.costco.com)!) or frozen blueberries).  That happens at around 8:15 AM every weekday.  That's pretty normal right?  I'm breaking that fast from about 9 PM the previous night until 8:15 AM that day.  That's a hefty 11 hours and 15 minutes fast every single day!  

The thing is...

I also break the fast from 8:25 AM (after I finish the cereal) to approximately 11 AM.  That's a not-quite-as-hefty 2 hours and 45 minutes fast.  But the thing is...I'm fasting twice **five times a week!**

Some people laugh at me about that.

Okay everyone that I tell that to laughs at me about that.

Okay [some people](http://www.adropofwater.net) say that I eat first breakfast and second breakfast.  And the aforementioned people, whoever they might be, also say that I'm like a hobbit.  Because (truth be told) I also have second lunch in the afternoon.

Finally I must admit that I actually don't eat as much as I was for awhile because [I have been setting aside time and closing out the world](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/15/separate-yourself/) in order to work more efficiently.

[Chick-Fil-A](http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Home.asp) is having **free** breakfasts on Fridays for the next few weeks in order to spread the news about their [new location](http://www.chick-fil-a.com/cfa.asp?template=map&transaction=locMap&recordId=1892)!

I'm spreading the love for Chick-Fil-A because their food is good, they close on Sundays to observe the Sabbath, and they are giving out **free** breakfast right now on Fridays.  And that's niiiice.
