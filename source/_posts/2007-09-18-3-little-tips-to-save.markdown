Here are some small things that you can do that might just save your more than you'd think.  They're easy to do, so give 'em a shot!  It's not a huge list of tips, but these are simply ones that I've thought of/started using recently.






  1. Navy Shower
Directions:


    1. Turn on water


    2. Rinse


    3. Turn off water


    4. Lather and scrub


    5. Turn on water


    6. Rinse off


    7. Turn off water


    8. Enjoy the moment of the day that you will be the cleanest



Save yourself water like the sailors had to do on ships.  You'll realize it's not bad at all.  I mean do you really need to have water being wasted while you scrub?  I doubt it.




  2. Coasting in the car - When you're driving around, think about the fact that only having two action options, accelerate and brake, could not be the most efficient.  There is room for some other option: do nothing and let the laws of physics propel you.  The momentum that you've previously gained can be utilized.  All you need to do is be more aware of things going on around you.  If there is a red light up ahead, take your foot off of both pedals and just let your car glide along.  Positives while doing this are


    1. Less stress - Coasting, as in life, will let you relax


    2. Save money - Not pressing the gas pedal will obviously not use gas and that is an obvious monetary savings


    3. Have fun (and stay awake) - It's like a game to accurately figure out when to let off the gas in order to coast such that you won't have to brake at all.  Great for when you're falling asleep, huh?


    4. Eliminate congestion - I should write about this sometime, but coasting at a constant speed in congestion will not only get you to your destination in the same time, but it will actually start the elimination of said congestion!  For those not totally self-centered, this can be seen as a huge positive.






  3. Always turn off the light when you leave a room.  No matter how long you're gone, it has been verified (okay okay, by the great [Mythbusters](http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html)) that it's more worthwhile to just turn off the light if you leave the room for ~20 seconds (I don't remember the actual number).





Pretty simple and straightforward, huh?  Let me know what you think about 'em in the comments.  Or even better, give me some other tips.

Edit: I totally forgot that when I was thinking of this post I actually meant to also say that these things will save you money but will also help save the environment!  Take that into account, why don't you?
