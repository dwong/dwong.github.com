As the weather warms up, I start to see more people out and about getting their exercise on.  That is, they're either getting out of the stuffy gym for some sunshine or they are actually realizing that it is nice to be outside instead of sitting on the couch.  Whatever their reason, it is good to see them out there.

**Unless of course they are old.**  Yeah, that is probably an ageist statement no matter how you slice it.

Anyways, my whole point is that an old person should not be running in 85Â° F heat with either a plastic suit or a sweatshirt/sweatpants on.  There are some things that are good and important (like exercise).  There is also a fair amount of wisdom in knowing when to take it 100% and when to err on the safe side.  A young guy trying to sweat out some water to make weight for high school wrestling can take the plastic suit a little better than an older gentleman in his 60s who is just trying to slim down for the ladies at the retirement home.

So remember, friends don't let friends let their grandparents go on a crash diet to get ready for cage fighting.  What, cage fighting?  Yeah that definitely seems like the only reasonable place for anyone over the age of 22 (i.e., post-collegiate wrestling) to wear a plastic suit.
