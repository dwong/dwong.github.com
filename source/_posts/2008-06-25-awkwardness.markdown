In a world that advances in technology, conveniences, and all sorts of other benefits, it is comforting to know that some things do not change.  No matter where we go, no matter how high we fly, awkwardness will never leave us!  Oh hooray!

More than that, it seems like things are getting worse.  What with the age of the computer upon us, our social interactions are changing rather dramatically pretty quickly.  Children, instead of playing with the other neighborhood kids, will play games online with strangers they've never actually met.  And while I am not opposed to playing games (I've played a game or two myself), you must admit that it is changing things up.  Instead of being active, we're watching more television.  The list goes on and on.

Even beyond childhood, we are maintaining our relationships through this newfangled phenomenon called the Internet.  On websites for all sorts of topics and aims, we are interacting with people in a whole new way.  We consider people that we've never met in real life our friends.  We spend countless hours writing on blogs (kind of like this one!).  You get the point.  I don't think that these things are bad in and of themselves, they are bringing our society to a place where social skills are declining.

On a related but slightly different note, is it just me or has the word awkward encroached everyday conversation over the past few years?  And somehow, I don't think that helps fight against the awkwardness.  While it does seem amusing at times, I've grown to dislike it quite wholeheartedly.  Perhaps it's because any amusement is always coming at someone's expense.  Someone who usually cannot afford to be laughed at.  Or maybe it's because I'd much prefer if everyone were comfortable instead.  Whatever the reason, awkwardness is no good.

Or am I the only one?
