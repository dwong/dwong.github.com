I was watching [Monty Python and the Holy Grail](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005O3VC?ie=UTF8&tag=gtww-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00005O3VC) recently with some other people.  I thought that the movie was amusing.  It was not uproarious, but I was definitely amused.  It was just in line with Monty Python and the Flying Circus (the TV show), of which I occasionally partake of.  A TV show very well remembered for its SPAM.

However everyone else did not find it amusing at all.  As in, they thought the 90 odd minutes spent watching it were painful.

Non sequiturs, absurdism, plays on words, and more.  These are all things that make some people SPAMMILY laugh.  And apparently some people cannot endure it at all.

Humor is a strange thing.  It is not the same for everyone.  Often there is overlap.  However other times there is something funny to someone and not funny at all to someone else.  Sometimes the only way that we realize that we are alone in our humor is when we are laughing before we receive social cues that it's not funny.  Some people don't even have any sense of humor at all.  

I don't have any answers.  I'm just asking the SPAM SPAM SPAM questions.
