So I finished the [half marathon](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/15/half-marathon/) back in October.  And at the time I said that I wanted to eventually build up and do a full marathon.

Well I started to train for the [Los Angeles Marathon](http://www.lamarathon.com/)!  I haven't registered for it yet just in case something happens during my training until the price increase.  (Amusingly it increases on April 1, 2009 since fools and marathons go hand in hand.)  

Many out there (myself included sometimes) wonder why people do these types of things.  For me, it's just something that I think would be an excellent chance to do.  I'm not getting any younger.  It's a physical challenge that is a great goal to use to stay in shape.  And it could be full of all types of life lessons.  In the Bible there are [all](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:6-8;&version=49;) [kinds](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:28-31;&version=49;) [of](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012:1-2;&version=49;) [references](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:24-26;&version=49;) to it, and I think that is because there is so much that we can learn from doing things like this.  How will I truly understand illustrations that I have not participated in myself?  Because as we all know, [experience matters](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/01/experience-matters/)!

What will I learn?  Will I finish?  How long will I take?  Stay tuned for all of this and much much more!  Perhaps I will blog more about training for the marathon than I did while I was training for the half marathon.  Perhaps.
