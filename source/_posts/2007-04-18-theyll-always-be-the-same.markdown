Because of computers, life has changed over the years.  They hold the promise of many things.  Quicker processing, automated functions, extensive memory are just a few of the available positives of them.  While they have changed and are continuing to change, people do not change quite as much.  Sure we change because now we know how to find things online whilst 20 years ago the common person did not.  However, the very essence of people will not change.  Take today for example.

In [an article](http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/18/pf/taxes/intuit_turbotax/?postversion=2007041811) that I read, we see just how people do not change.




  * Hundreds of years ago, the roads must have been clogged with people traveling by foot/horse to get to the local magistrate to pay their taxes.


  * Years ago, the post office was jam packed with lines out the door as people stood in line to mail their taxes.


  * Today (figuratively, yesterday literally) countless people try to file their taxes in the hours before the tax deadline and clog up the servers.



It is amusing to see that people will truly not change.  If they can do things faster then do they finish them faster?  No, they wait to start it later.  People never learn.  We truly are running around in circles and simply staying in the same place.  Boy, we must be dizzy by now.
