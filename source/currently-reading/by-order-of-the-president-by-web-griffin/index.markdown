And it's fun read time!

[2008-02-29]
I finished the book.  I am so lame that I didn't write anything about the book for a month and a half.  Man that book took me longer than I thought!

Anyways the basic premise of the book, which you could easily get from reading the book jacket is that there is a hubbub about a missing 727 airplane.  The intelligence community is trying to find out about it, but they are unable to because they're stupid.  Haha I mean that they aren't working well with each other.  If you're from one of the intelligence agencies, please don't hunt me down for that comment.

So the president and the secretary of homeland security come up with a plan to use a guy that they trust, one Charles Castillo, to find out as much as possible.  They want to know what happened and whether there were any holes in the process.

Suffice to say, Castillo does find things wrong and nobody who is at fault is happy about that.

And as a rich, good-looking guy (the Secret Service in the book nickname him Don Juan) he has other exploits.

In the end, with the help from unsuspected sources, he is able to track down the plane and restore order to the world.  A happy ending.  All is well.

Girls have their romance novels, and guys have their military fiction.  Go figure.
