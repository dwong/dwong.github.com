[_The Prometheus Deception_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312978367?ie=UTF8&tag=dereksxanga-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0312978367) by Robert Ludlum

I started this book last week and it has definitely been a fast read.  This is very likely one of my favorite genres: action.  And more specifically this is a classic cloak-and-dagger terrorism and counter terrorism novel.  I like the action that comes with novels involving shooting and scheming.  In comparison to my last book, this one is going by as quick as can be!

In any case, thus far I've learned that the main character Nick Bryson is one of the best in the counter terrorism business.  However, he makes a mistake, and is retired mostly against his will.  He settles into a life of retirement when one day his world is turned upside down.  He is shown the truth in a very [Alias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_%28TV_series%29)-like fashion that he worked that whole time for the wrong side.

Now he is on a journey to find out what that means for himself as well as to possibly stop the terrorist group that posed as a counter terrorist group.

Currently that journey means blowing up a ship full of illegal weaponry to smithereens.  That is just awesome.

Man this book is going quickly!  It's rather refreshing that it's so exciting actually.  Currently Bryson is in the midst of trying to discover more about who is at the bottom of everything.  He has found some people that he used to have ties with, and he has discovered some new things.  All in all, he has realized that he cannot trust anyone except his coincidentally beautiful and highly skilled accomplice Layla.  

Layla is from the Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency) and has gladly accompanied him in many situations so far.  It's nice to just happen upon an amazing woman like that, huh?  There is a little bit of sexual tension between them because I think that they are both attracted to each other physically as well as to each others' abilities.  So far at this point they have just kissed upon parting that seemed to Bryson as if it were more than the kiss of a friend.

On another note, there have been a number of attempts on Bryson's life that he has escaped.  From all directions, there have been killers out to hunt him down.  He discovers that there is a bounty on his head in the amount of $2 million.  Well that sucks.

I think that the only bad thing about this book is that Bryson is just _too_ good at what he does.  It never really seems like he's in all that much danger.  He's too superhuman to be believable.  He'll go up against men with guns and have nothing with him, but then the tide will turn and he'll have won the fight.  That's slightly ridiculous.  Oh well, it still makes for good reading!

Okay well I finished the book.  That was pretty fast considering that I was mainly just reading it for 30-60 minutes each day!  The story becomes more convoluted with many twists and turns.  It was an exciting finish with a satisfyingly happy ending.  Well for the most part.

Summary:
Interest Rating - 9/10
Literary Worth Rating - 6/10
Comments - This was a good read that was quick and really interesting.  It's not going to make you look up a whole bunch of words or really challenge you too much if you have a reading level higher than a high schooler, though.  Read it for fun and get lost in another world that might actually exist.
