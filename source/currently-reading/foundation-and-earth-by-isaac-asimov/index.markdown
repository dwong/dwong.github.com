Foundation And Earth by Isaac Asimov

[2007-09-28]
And I'm continuing on with the series!  I just finished with Foundation's Edge, and now I want to find out more about the decision that Trevise made at the very end of that novel.r

So now Bliss (a young attractive woman from Gaia) is now romantically involved with Trevise's traveling partner, Pelorat (who is an older scholar).  That makes for some rather interesting interaction between all of them.  Trevise is not happy with them.  There hasn't been all too much (if any, I can't exactly recall) mention of the First Foundation and the Second Foundation thus far.  But it's still early in the book.  I'm sure that they'll come up.

Trevise, Pelorat, and Bliss are continuing to travel all around in their search for Earth.  I like how Asimov uses things about Earth as we know it in the the context of the future as if they are so difficult to believe as to be fantasy.  I've seen that people can do this even with older societies that they are studying.  Just because there is nobody around to defend it, an attack on the credibility will eventually come.

They're starting to hone in on Earth (at least it seems so because they're supposedly on one of those earliert planets that got settled).  I'm very interested to see if and when they do find Earth and how that plays into the entire story.

Oh and the book got pretty...interesting at one point.  Trevise, not completely by compulsion, had sex with one of the female officials on a planet that portrayed as a regimented and completely orderly society!  That was pretty different.  It reminded me a little of [Disclosure by Michael Crichton](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099303744?ie=UTF8&tag=gtww-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0099303744).  Well whatever the case, they escaped the sticky situation that seemed to entrap them, so the story goes on!



##### Conclusion


Alright lame that I just jumped to the conclusion.  I don't remember when I finished it, but I do remember that the ending was QUITE interesting.  It's especially surprising if you don't read the books in their intended order but rather the order that they were written (as I did).  Suffice to say that even though the story doesn't end, there is enough closure to move on and be satisfied.

Interest: 9/10
Literary worth: 7/10 - It's still just a fiction book.  But at least the language is at an adult level.  Also the references that can be gained by reading this are pretty priceless if you hear someone talking about it.
