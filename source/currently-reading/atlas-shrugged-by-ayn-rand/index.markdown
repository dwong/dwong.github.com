This is a controversial book that is said to be one of the most influential in history.  Some even say second only to the Bible.  Now whether that is true is definitely up for discussion!

Now I'm off to start it.  I must make sure to stay mindful of what I'm reading, lest I let it accidentally creep into my subconscious.  I have to make sure that I examine every idea that I encounter thoroughly because I know that Rand is notorious for making something that is fairly anti-Christian sound reasonable (when in actuality it is not).

So I've been reading this book for awhile now, and it has definitely been interesting.  I just finished reading part 1 (out of 3).  In it I follow the story of Dagny Taggert as she tries to save her struggling railroad from collapse.  She meets and interacts with Francisco d'Anconia (an extremely rich and successful inheritor of a copper dynasty) and Hank Rearden (a self-made entrepreneur) as they fight against an intangible enemy.

While they are attempting to make the best of the world and make as much money as they can, it seems like they are always encountering people who are arguing for the care of social concerns.  Others are vying to make everyone the same.  They value fairness at all costs and regard this as an ideal that is higher than anything else.

This results in people that are not trying to make the best of their abilities.  They are satisfied with the here and now, and they refuse to see the broader meaning to things.

In a way this makes so much sense to my human nature because I want people to be doing their best rather than holding back for some ideal.  Rand is known to elevate the human individual and portray them as heroic (as I know from having read _The Fountainhead_).  And as a human, this is very appealing.  But on the other hand it's interesting because some of the things that she denounces as utter evil (e.g., caring for others, forgiveness) are things that I, as a Christian, value.  In addition to that Christians cannot regard humans as heroic.  They are regarded as base and evil from the uttermost.  We cannot save ourselves.  We need salvation, which only Jesus Christ can provide.

It's been interesting reading this book while the Barack Obama is being ushered in as the president of the United States of America.  His speeches and actions remind me so much of what Rand paints as utter evil.  And that's interesting because I don't want to agree with Obama and I don't want to agree with Rand.  They're opposed and yet neither are right for me.
