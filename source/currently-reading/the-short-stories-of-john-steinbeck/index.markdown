The Short Stories of John Steinbeck (a collection of them that I bought at a used book sale at the library for $.50!)

[2008-09-15]
So I've actually been reading this collection for a little while now.  Long enough to have finished 2 of the short stories already.  So I'll just try to catch up even while I continue to read it.



##### Tortilla Flats


Story about a ragtag group of paisanos who go through life without a care only to find that there is something worth their while.



##### The Red Pony


A boy grows up a little faster than need be, and through life on a farm he learns lessons about life.  He learns that life is not easy, but that it still holds promise of great things.

##### The Moon Is Down


A story about the invasion of a small town during World War II by the Germans.  While initially shocked into submission, the people learn that within themselves they find the fire for freedom that burns brightly.  And Mayor Orden proves to be a man of great mettle when he chooses courage in the face of danger.



##### Of Mice And Men


This is probably one of Steinbeck's most famous short stories.  2 brothers are trying to get by with hopes of something better.  But unfortunately life seems to get in their way time and again.  And sadly the story doesn't always end well.



##### Cannery Row


This story reminds me a bit of Steinbeck's _Tortilla Flat_ as it talks about a ragtag bunch of me and the adventures that they get themselves into.  Through the course of the story, they learn that there is more to life than what they've seen, that is caring for themselves and taking it easy through life.  They learn to make more out of their life on cannery row.  They learn to care about others.

##### The Pearl


I just finished this story about people that have to deal with finding great wealth.  The problems that come along with it try the very fabric of the culture, and they must decide whether it is all worth it.  Unfortunately, it all ends badly for the couple, and it goes to show that changing things up is not necessarily as good as many people think.
