So I decided to continue with the series.  It should be as good as the others (I hope!).

Alright so I've been reading this book for a month now.  It's still pretty good, but it's definitely moving forward with the story.  It's now 500 years past the end of the Galactic Empire.  The Foundation is huge and pretty much the dominant force in the Galaxy.  The story alternates between following characters in the First and Second Foundations.

In the Second Foundation, they suspect that there might be a power greater than themselves.  That would be really amazing because they have the power to do things with their minds that are unimaginable!  They can control other people, communicate by sheer force of their mind, and more!  In any case, they suspect something might be going on...

In the First Foundation, there is great technological advance beyond all imagination as well.  The ships traveling in hyperspace are amazing vessels that allow for superior power over all other things.  The Mayor of Terminus (essentially the leader of the First Foundation) seems to also have something up her sleeve.  She has sent out a young politician under the guise of exile in order to search for the origin of humanity, Earth, and ultimately to help her destroy all other powers (the Second Foundation, etc) so that the First Foundation can rule.  Nobody knows where Earth is, so it seems fairly interesting to see how/why they're doing what they're doing.

Currently it seems like things are going to converge on a planet (Gaia).  All of the major players are going there, so who knows what will happen!

Alright so I just finished the book.  Basically it ends with Trevise making a future altering decision about which route the Galaxy should take.  It can either be Gaia, the First Foundation, or the Second Foundation that will rule.  Each will do it in their own way.  What does he choose?  Well...Gaia.  But whatever that means is yet to be seen.
