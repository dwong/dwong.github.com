_FYI: This is slightly satirical so don't be so confused when I'm mixing fact with fiction._

"Why do you want to know about me?" asked the computer.

"Well obviously I'm deeply interested to know about the one that serves me," you retort.

The computer answered and said, "I'm a simple Pentium III 450 MHz computer with 384 MB RAM."

"But tell me more about than what you simple ARE; more importantly, what have you become?" you ask.

"I'm glad that you asked," proclaimed the computer. It continues, "I proudly run [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) with [Fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/) as a window manager. It has given me new life from my old days as a Windows 98 machine. I am proud to also say that I am running Apache2 with PHP installed in ADDITION TO a brand spanking new MySQL database as my memory! I can remember all kinds of things now, and I can respond much more quickly. My brain is like a steel trap at this point! If you have any questions, feel free to ask the guy masquerading as my owner. (Apparently I am incapable of answering on my own. Oh well.)"

It concludes, "Oh yes and my name is Sir Wserver. Don't forget it. And come back often. Leave me a comment! I can read them in my spare time when I'm not serving all of these people their pages."
