You and I are different.  Either you are not a software engineer, highly observant (like a hawk really), [nerdy](http://www.goingthewongway.com/208/difference-between-nerd-geek-and-dork/), a Christian, slightly sarcastic, definitely strange, [run barefoot](http://www.goingthewongway.com/631/barefoot-running/) or be named Derek Wong.  And if you are all of these things then you, dear reader, are an IDENTITY THIEF!

Come here to be surprised, just as in life.  I don't promise that you will be interested, but I'll do my best.  My name is Derek Wong, and I'm finding my own way thank you very much.
