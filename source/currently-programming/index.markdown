I am a software engineer by day, and a software engineer by night.  That's right.  I actually enjoy programming even in my spare time.  I do not do it all of the time, but I would list it as one of my past times.


### Current Projects





	
  * <del>The Budgeteeer</del> [Budse](/item?0,http://budse.sourceforge.net)
A budgeting program that allows you to keep track of sub-accounts.  Deposits can be made into particular accounts or in the entire account with a percentage split toward the sub-accounts.




### Past Projects





	
  * Grocery Pricer ([details](http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/grocery-pricer/)) - A program that allows you to contribute and feed from collective knowledge.  Use the application in order to supply your grocery price data and/or view prices.  It will calculate average prices as well as maximum and minimums according to different stores.Note: I have shelved this project for the time being.  Okay actually it's been shelved for over a year since I really just want to redo it completely.  It still seems like a stupendous idea, though.

	
  * Soi-Disant - I created the entire theme for this site. I named it soi-disant and [released it awhile back](http://www.goingthewongway.com/221/extra-extra-check-out-the-new-theme/).  Doing this required me to use PHP, HTML, CSS, and design skills (that I at times sorely lacked).

	
  * Wedding website (including an online RSVP application) - This was for my own wedding so I had to do a good job on it!  I decided to tackle this on my own since I had previously done an RSVP application for a wedding for someone else.  While I did not use that previous application, I definitely learned from doing that as I wrote a new one.  To make this website happen, I ventured into the land of [Drupal](/item?0,http://drupal.org/).  I had to learn not only how to set a Drupal website up, I also had to learn how to write web applications in their framework.  It turned out to be an excellent experience once I got through the learning curve!The RSVP portion of the website consisted of:

	
    * MySQL database table set up

	
    * PHP parsing scripts (for the CSV files that we used to create our guestlist, etc)

	
    * A multi-step validating RSVP page, including error and required field validation

	
    * Dashboard for viewing statistics and status




	
  * [Fatsheep Printing](/item?0,http://fatsheepprinting.com/) - I ventured back into the land of web programming for a friend's business, but instead of doing each page manually I tried my hand at creating a generator in Python.  It was actually pretty enjoyable and I ended up utilizing Python, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
