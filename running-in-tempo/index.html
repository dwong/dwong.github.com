    <h1 class="post-title">Running In Tempo</h1>
    <span class="post-date">Sep 28</span>
    <p>In Runner’s World Magazine, I recently read <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-267--11909-0,00.html">an article about tempo running</a> that made me want to get back into the groove of running.  Tempo running (also known as lactate-threshold or threshold running)</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1149/1454476664_4846b1c5de_o.jpg" alt="kidrunners" /><em>Photo courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/people/w2/">W2 a-w-f-i-l</a></em></p>

<p>Until college, I always despised any running that I did.  Whether for P.E. or for sports, it was always a chore that was done with little enjoyment.  A necessary evil that we a prerequisite for the fun of something else.</p>

<p>And then in college something changed.  My fitness level was probably about the same so that wasn’t it.  My location and life were obviously different.  Whatever the reason was, though, I started to realize that running allowed me to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Stay fit</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get some fresh air</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explore the area on foot rather than in a car</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spend some time alone in my thoughts</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I would run the loop around campus on a fairly regular basis.  I even started to enter into a few races.  What a turnaround from only a year or two before!  In any case by the time that I left college I was fairly comfortable going out for runs for recreation and fitness purposes.  In fact, I was even going out with other people occasionally for a little bit of socializing (in addition to the fitness benefit)!</p>

<p>So enough about the history of me and running.  I started to recently run a little bit (only once or twice a week, mind you).  However, after reading the article I was for some strange reason under an incorrect impression about tempo runs.  I thought that they were run faster than they really are.  I mean, “an 8 on a 1-to-10 scale” sounds pretty fast to me!  But reading the rest of the article as well as <a href="http://runningtimes.com/rt/articles/?id=5615&amp;page=2&amp;c=85">another article on tempo runs</a> made me realize that it’s simply more of a steady consistent pace, albeit a pace faster than one might normally jog.</p>

<p>What I have been doing is running at a consistent pace but for only much shorter intervals.  This week I ran 4 sets of 3:30 runs at probably about an 8 minutes/mile pace with a 60 second jog between sets.  Let me tell you that it’s not easy!  But I rather enjoy the challenge and am once again starting to enjoy the time alone, outside, and not in front of a computer (now that I’m in front of one the entire day for work).</p>

<p>I’m not sure whether I’m going to continue this regime of running at a fairly brisk pace (but definitely NOT sprinting) for longer periods of time or whether I’m actually going to try a tempo run for 20 minutes.  Whatever the case, I will continue the running as it is affording me benefits that I value.</p>

<p>Running is even more than just exercise, though.  Have you thought of that?  You can learn a lot about life from running.  You can learn about yourself: are you persevering, are you stronger in mind than in body, are you even in shape?  You can teach yourself to be independent and strong in mind.  Running a race has been used as an analogy to life, and that’s because it is so true.  How better to understand the analogy (and correspondingly life) than by running yourself?</p>

<p>So go.  Do it.  Just do it.  (Does anyone remember Nike’s once ubiquitous slogan?  Whatever happened to that?  They went from simple to complex marketing in my opinion.)</p>
