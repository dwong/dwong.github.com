          Career Ramblings For All
	</a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">May  5</span>

      <p>I happened on a site for <a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/">Career Development</a> a little while back (I believe from the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> homepage).  It caught my eye because they had an article on helping with your resume.  Now granted I already have a job, but I still remember what a pain it was to be searching for a job.  At the time, I didn’t have time to read the article on doing a resume makeover, but I bookmarked the page to read at a later time.  Boy am I glad that I did.</p>

<p>This site is run be a couple of people who have experience in corporate America.  They give both their thoughts as well as their advice on topics that might be of use to those of us who are also working in some way.  This ranges anywhere from the entrepreneurs to the low man on the totem pole.  They have tips on resume writing, on interviewing, as well as a myriad of other topics.  All of the posts are well thought out and fairly to the point (often consisting of lists).  It’s especially useful reading for those looking for a job.  Although the site as a whole reaches out to all of those of us who are working, individual posts aren’t always applicable.  But I suppose that wide spectrum of people in the audience dictates that as necessary.</p>

<p>Anyways, days after initially bookmarking the page I added the site to my RSS reader.  And as they say, I haven’t looked back since.</p>

<p>A few of my favorite posts thus far:</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<p>They’re having <a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/05/03/review-career-ramblings-for-a-backlink/">a promotion where you link</a> to their site as well as write a review.  This essentially raises your online profile by providing their readers with a link to your site, and it also raises their ranking in search engines that use backlinks as a method by which to calculate “importance.”  This is fairly beneficial for both parties involved.  And even though they might have gotten the idea from a certain site about how to make money online by blogging ( ;-) ), I still think it’s a useful endeavor because this site is useful for nearly everyone out there!</p>

          You Get To See Some Statistics

      <span class="post-date">May  4</span>

      <p>So just to let you know, I made a statistics page available for readers to peruse.  It lists general information such as how many posts and how many comments.  The most interesting statistic (in my opinion) is the list of the commentors and how many comments they have left.  However, I must admit that the commenting seems to be fairly unevenly weighted.  Does that make you want to do anything on my posts?  ;-)</p>

<p>In any case, check out the “Statistics” page in the navbar.</p>

      <span class="post-date">May  4</span>

      <p>Sometimes Chinese people do good things.  Sometimes Chinese people do bad things.  And sometimes Chinese people sure do some stupid things.</p>

<p>Get this: Chinese people copied Disneyland.  As in, they made a Disneyland <strong>park</strong>.  Are you kidding me?!</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/04/keepin-it-real-fake-part-lv-disneyland/">an Engadget article about the fake Disneyland</a> that got me to searching for more information.  Amusingly, they have characters that closely mimic the Disney ones as well as rides that indicate how much of a fake it is.  Their slogan (according to <a href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=20&amp;art_id=41990&amp;sid=13078355&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070411">this other article</a>) is that “Disneyland is too far.”  Wow, that is unbelievable.  I think that actually the most amusing thing about Beijing’s Shijingshan Amusement Park is that its website is <a href="http://www.bs-amusement-park.com">http://www.bs-amusement-park.com</a>.  Haha you read that right, it’s the BS amusement park.</p>

<p>Although pretty humorous, this actually touches on a more serious issue (which was touched on at <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/14/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/">Even Worse Than At First Glance</a>).  And that issue is copyright infringement (or in this case complete disregard for copyrights whatsoever).</p>

      <p>I got a piece of junk mail the other day.  I looked at it for a bit.  Then I said, “Eh junk mail, I’m going to delete this.”</p>

<p>The thing is, it was a piece of paper mail.</p>

      <h3 id="chicago-bulls-vs-miami-heat">Chicago Bulls vs Miami Heat</h3>

<p>You’ve gotta hand it to the Bulls, they can roll.  I enjoyed watching them tear up the Heat.  Although I don’t think that I hold any ill feelings toward Shaquille O’Neal for leaving the Lakers, I’m not a big Heat fan.  I’m not even sure what it is.  I just don’t really care for them.  I think that Wade is overrated (although good), and the rest of the team is just a bunch of cocky goons (namely Antoine Walker).</p>

<h3 id="golden-state-warriors-vs-dallas-mavericks">Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks</h3>

<p>Though never really a fan of the Warriors, I’ve also never really been opposed to them.  I’ve enjoyed watching their series against the Mavericks.  However, I thought it quite disappointing that they couldn’t close out against them last night with a <strong>nine</strong> point lead with a few minutes left!  That’s too bad.  I’m a fan of how strong Baron Davis and Jason Richardson are playing.  I’m not really a fan of Stephen Jackson because I think that he’s a crybaby.  And Al Harrington?  Forgot to show up.  Here’s hoping that they close it out for real next time and send Mark Cuban &amp; Co. packing.</p>

<h3 id="los-angeles-lakers-vs-phoenix-suns">Los Angeles Lakers vs Phoenix Suns</h3>

<p>I’ll always be a fan of the Lakers.  But they have been straight-up disappointing nearly the entire year!  Kobe is pretty amazing sometimes (everyone <em>has</em> to admit that), but he both can’t do everything and can’t always be so amazing.  Until they either get a real team or they learn to work together consistently, they won’t ever get very far in the playoffs.  All of the other teams are just too good to monkey around every night.  I’ll be cheering for the Suns in a week (even though they talked a little too much before the series started about how they’d steamroll the Lakers).</p>

<h3 id="cleveland-cavaliers-vs-washington-wizards">Cleveland Cavaliers vs Washington Wizards</h3>

<p>I watched part of the game on Sunday.  I fell asleep.  That’s pretty much all you need to know about this series.</p>

<h3 id="denver-nuggets-vs-san-antonio-spurs">Denver Nuggets vs San Antonio Spurs</h3>

<p>I thought the Nuggets could pull something off, especially after the first game.  But the Spurs seem relentless.  And Robert Horry must dream throughout the entire season about making those big playoff shots.  The series isn’t that close, but it’s still fairly entertaining.</p>

<h3 id="new-jersey-nets-vs-toronto-raptors">New Jersey Nets vs Toronto Raptors</h3>

<p>I think the Nets should have been finished with the series already.</p>

<h3 id="orlando-magic-vs-detroit-pistons">Orlando Magic vs Detroit Pistons</h3>

<p>Why did they even have to play this series?  I thought they would be better.  But the Magic players never showed up at the same time.  Something must have been wrong with their alarm clocks.  Maybe they need five alarms.</p>

<h3 id="houston-rockets-vs-utah-jazz">Houston Rockets vs Utah Jazz</h3>

<p>Rooting for the Rockets.  They have showed glimpses of how far they could go with their 1-2 combo of McGrady and Yao.  However, it hasn’t been consistent enough to knock out the Jazz yet.  Chinese guy?  I’m for the Rockets.  Plus they’ve got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafer_Alston">Skip To My Lou</a>!  You’ve gotta cheer for that guy.  Even if he does have the worst Field Goal % in the NBA.</p>
