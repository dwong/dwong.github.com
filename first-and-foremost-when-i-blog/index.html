<div class="entry-content"><p>Web logging.  Weblogging.  We blogging.  Oh yeah we&rsquo;re blogging!</p>

<p>Why do we do it?  Why do I do it?  It&rsquo;s such an interesting phenomenon.  People have been writing in journals and diaries for years and years.  But those always seemed to be meant to be secret.  Along come computers and the Internet and all of a sudden there are people who have a desire to write things in a completely public forum.  What is the attraction?  I know that I have met people who have asked just these questions.</p>

<p>So why <em>do</em> I do it?  Well I think that a large attraction for me is to be able to freely express myself in whatever way I want.  I can say something and not be graded or judged (okay I guess that you could judge me in some ways) based on it.  I am able to say what I want when I want.  I can rant about the guy that bugs me or I could talk about the small pleasures of life.  Some people have their radio shows, others have their newspaper columns.  But for the average Joe, what public forum is available to express the joys and outrages of life?  Aren&rsquo;t our opinions as worthy (if not as well voiced) as those more famous opinion expressers?</p>

<p>Rory over at <a href="http://cleancutblog.com/">Clean Cut Blog</a> has a <a href="http://cleancutblog.com/group-writing-project-what-is-your-first-rule-of-writing/">Group Writing Project</a> that is intended to allow many people to write about what their absolute first rule of writing is.  I was reminded of it after reading Shelly&rsquo;s post <a href="http://thiseclecticlife.com/2007/07/27/fishing-for-an-audience/">Fishing For An Audience</a>.</p>

<p>So after thinking about my reasons for even having a blog, I realize that I&rsquo;ll only do it when <strong>it is interesting to me</strong>.  That seems rather obvious, but it very accurately describes what I do with this blog and why I do what I do.  That is why this blog is not like others.  Hopefully that is <em>not</em> why it&rsquo;s not the most popular blog on the Internet.  I mean, I&rsquo;d like to think that what I am interested in has some appeal to other people.</p>

<p>Anyways, although there are many many good blogs out there and the popular opinion is that they should focus on a particular area, I think that I like to keep this blog a place where I can show people how I go my own way.  You know, the wong way.  And each time I write a post, that is what I keep in mind.</p>
