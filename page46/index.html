Well if you haven’t, in short it is what allows you to memorize “google.com” rather than “72.14.207.99”. Every time you enter a website address into a browser, the browser first has to retrieve the actual numerical address (called an IP address) that corresponds to it so that it can actually access the website.</p> <p>A real-world analogy would be looking up a phone number in a telephone book. You likely don’t memorize everyone’s number. In fact, you probably don’t know all too many by heart. But you can easily remember someone’s name, right?</p> <p>So each time you enter the address, your web browser has to ask a DNS server to give you the IP address. Very often, your ISP will have a DNS cache to more quickly give you the IP address.</p> <p>Something everyone should consider using is <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a>. It is a couple of DNS servers that are able to specify on your own computer to always use instead of whatever it is that you would otherwise use. Why is it good? Well OpenDNS offers things like safety from malicious websites (e.g. a misspelled website that causes you to arrive at a malicious website) and speed (likely from optimized servers) to name a few. Try it out, and see if you can notice a difference. I have and I do!</p> <p>There are instructions at the OpenDNS website for every operating system, and they take but a few minutes. *[IP]: Internet Protocol *[ISP]: Internet Service Provider *[DNS]: Domain Name System</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/yay-for-frequent-commentators/"> Yay For Frequent Commentators </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 6</span> <p>I think that commenting is one of the most interesting and enticing things about an online blog. It allows one to share their thoughts, but it also allows others to give feedback on those thoughts! I like to comment on other blogs, but I also like to respond to comments on my own blog.</p> <p>So after participating a bit at <a href="http://onemansblog.com">One Man’s Blog</a> (who is also having a great <a href="http://onemansblog.com/2007/09/06/ombs-new-member-of-the-month-contest/">contest for becoming a “member”</a> of his site right now where he gives away something to the winner of a random drawing), and enjoying it very much I decided that I would do something similar to what he does.</p> <p>Instead of <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/10/no-nofollow/">removing the nofollow</a> on each and every commentator’s link, he instead creates a refreshed list of the top 10 commentators and provides them with a link back that way. I think that after seeing how I can sometimes be getting the single comments just to get a link, I think that this is a more prudent decision to minimize single-line “spammy” comments.</p> <p>So therefore I am going to go for installing the <a href="http://www.pfadvice.com/wordpress-plugins/show-top-commentators/">Show Top Commentators</a> plugin.</p> <p>The way to get onto the list is as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Use the same information (name, e-mail, website) when leaving comments. It might be easiest to simply register (which I have opened up) on my website. You’ll be able to log in and not have to enter your information each time you leave a comment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leave comments! It’s fun anyways, I think to get to give feedback to the author (and be assured that authors do enjoy feedback, especially this author).</p> </li> <li> <p>The plugin will gather its data from the last 60 days, so be active else you fall and cease being the king of the mountain. Hm I always enjoyed that game (king of the mountain, not falling).</p> </li> </ol> <p>Oh an don’t worry, it will start immediately and retroactively use the comments that you’ve left. So we actually don’t start off with a clean slate, but I wouldn’t think that would be fair anyways to those that have graced me with their participation.</p> <p>I’m going to remove myself from any sort of communities for adding dofollow. I don’t really get too much traffic from them, and the traffic that I do get is usually people just leaving a single comment to get the link back to their site. I like the idea of adding dofollow, I just don’t like how it’s worked out for me thus far.</p> <p>Comments might not make the world go ‘round, but they sure are more pleasant than the alternative.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/is-the-40-30-20-10-rule-too-ideal/"> Is The 40-30-20-10 Rule Too Ideal? </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 4</span> <p>There are many sources out there for how to get money, how to invest money, how to save money, and so on and so forth. But in reality, money is a fairly simple concept that seems to get muddled and complicated because people have such a vested interest in it. And because analysts want to keep their job of explaining the complex to the uneducated.</p> <p>Basically you earn money (or you find it, or you steal it, or whatever) so that is what is coming in, and then you spend it (or you give it away, or you lose it, you know) and that is what is going out. So what’s the best thing to do? Well spend less than you earn and you should do right fine. Makes sense huh?</p> <p>A while ago I read about a basic rule for which one could ideally budget and limit one’s spending. It’s called the 40-30-20-10 rule for obvious reasons. The very quick among you would have already realized that those numbers add up to 100 and that would seem to represent 100% of your income. So what do the rest of the numbers represent?</p> <ul> <li> <p>40 - Savings</p> </li> <li> <p>30 - Necessary spending such as rent, food, bills, etc</p> </li> <li> <p>20 - Free expenditure allowing any possibility of spending on entertainment, gifts, and otherwise unnecessary for living types of things</p> </li> <li> <p>10 - Tithe</p> </li> </ul> <p>When I first read that, it seemed pretty easy and straightforward to me! However, I am wondering if it’s too easy to look at on paper but perhaps a bit too difficult in reality. How many people do you know who only live on 30% of their income? It sounds extremely conservative doesn’t it? You’d require a much better income just to be living an average lifestyle. Of course, I think that’s kind of the point of this budgeting scheme. However, I honestly don’t think that too many people could adhere to this type of drastic budgeting change from their own methods because they have come to expect a level of “luxury” in their lives.</p> <p>I think that this is a superb idea, and I will try to stick with it as much as I can. I’ve been working on <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/the-budgeteer/">The Budgeteer</a> (although that’s not what this post is really about), and I’ve been using this budgeting as my budgeting inputs. It’s been going alright thus far, and I actually have personally increased my savings category since my necessary expenditures are currently not as high. It’s nice, but I’m wondering if it’ll always be so.</p> <p>Have many people heard of this plan? Would/could/will many practically use it?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/get-me-out-of-here/"> Get Me Out Of Here </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 30</span> <p>Alright alright, that was a lame title considering what it’s about. This is just to note that I just hacked a couple of my plugins so that they don’t display me or my information anymore.</p> <p>For example, in the recent comments in the sidebar, it was showing my comments, but I have removed that so that now it will only show comments by people other than me.</p> <p>And then for the Stats page that is displayed, I have decided to only let it show information that is unrelated to me. Hopefully that will give some better statistics for you to see on what is actually popular with other people rather than just with me!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/sneezing-coughingkeep-it-to-yourself/"> Sneezing, Coughing...Keep It To Yourself! </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 28</span> <p>This past weekend was quite an ordeal. I saw many instances of disgusting behavior that even more solidified my belief that people are just gross. Is it because I live in a fastidious society that elevates cleanliness to godliness? Perhaps it is. But it doesn’t matter because I am still grossed out by others no matter what the reason.</p> <p>Sneezing is a naturally occurring action. Our body responds like that because it is trying to rid itself of something that does not belong. Perhaps it is because we are sick and it’s trying to expel some germ-infested mucus. Or more than likely it is because there is some dust or other foreign particle caught inside of our body. So the body is doing a great thing when it reacts with a sneeze. However, there is no need to be at a swap meet and turn to the side to sneeze. The reason that there is no need for that is because there might be other people standing near there. And those people might not appreciate your nasty disgusting expelled mucus even close to them. Thanks.</p> <p>Coughing is a similarly outstanding action that the body uses to save itself from harm. It can happen in order to keep the windpipe clear so that we can breathe. Well I guess it can also happen in order to signal someone about something. But that is not what I’m thinking of. I’m thinking of that hacking repeated cough that some are so inclined to do. You know where you don’t do that? At a buffet. A place where everyone essentially shares the same food. You don’t cough on your hand. You know why? It’s because you are going to use that same hand to get your food. That is sick. You also do not sneeze all over food. It doesn’t matter if you don’t like it. It doesn’t matter what you’re doing. You can feel it (it doesn’t sneak up on you) so please just put anything in your hand down so that you can cover up. That is even more sick! I hope that you don’t know what you are doing and what germs are because if you knew and still did it, you should be so ashamed.</p> <p>I do not appreciate when people are inconsiderate. Have you ever noticed how easy it is for us (in general as people) to truly only care about ourselves? It’s our natural carnal tendency, whether you’d like to admit it or not. Some acknowledge this and try their darnedest to fight it. Some have been changed. And some just don’t care. I’d hope that I’m not the latter ranting and raving against my own.</p> <p>So next time you cough, sneeze, or in some other way do something that can affect others, think about what you’d want others to do. And put some hand sanitizer on that mess.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page47">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page45">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
