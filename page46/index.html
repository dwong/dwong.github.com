  <div class="entry-content"><p>So as someone who is inside of the office everyday, it is quite rare to get to experience what many people do on a day-to-day basis.  And that is getting to be outside of a building.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer, whatever that means.  Well I know what that means, but you don&rsquo;t really care about it anyways.  In any case that means that I spend much of my day sitting in a chair in front of a computer.  There are some good and bad things about this.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong>: Don&rsquo;t waste too much energy, not difficult physically.
<strong>Bad</strong>: Can easily take in more calories than output which leads to fatness and an unhealthy lifestyle.  Additionally, muscles can slowly atrophy such that when presented with a life or death situation where you need to grab onto a bar and hold up both you and your loved ones with one arm, you will all fall to an untimely demise.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong>: Do something that you enjoy - problem solving, thinking logically about solutions to somewhat concrete (but not real concrete) problems.
<strong>Bad</strong>: Get lazy and don&rsquo;t experience the other many many other good things in life.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong>: Don&rsquo;t get sunburned, don&rsquo;t get skin cancer.
<strong>Bad</strong>: Look like a pale alien unless you actually go out.  However, due to being inside and being so pale it would be even easier to get sunburned if sunscreen is forgotten.</p>

<p>All in all, I don&rsquo;t want to be that person that is always inside and becomes lazy.  Good thing for trees that overgrow their boundaries and require chopping!</p>

<p>Oh yeah I was outside over the weekend cutting branches off of trees that were touching the roof.  And you know what?  It wasn&rsquo;t too bad.  I felt like a woodsman.  It&rsquo;s not going to be a job of mine anytime soon, but I don&rsquo;t mind finding a little Paul Bunyan in me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you ever think that so much of the time, conversations with other people consist of talking about what you do?  Whether that means talking about what is going on in school, your current job situation, events that you&rsquo;ve gone to, and so on, it&rsquo;s always rather based on past experience.</p>

<p>And do people read into it and see who you really are?  Well probably sometimes they do.  Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s very likely that only your closer friends can actually talk about other things.</p>

<p>When you talk to someone and you have to tell them what you do for a living, you know it&rsquo;s not going to be a mind-blowing conversation.  Especially if it&rsquo;s because you broached the subject after running out of other things to say.  It&rsquo;s even worse if you have to talk about the weather.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You, the one with the Bluetooth headset in your ear.  You, doing anything you can to get a few more car lengths ahead on your commute.  You, with your way of filling up every second of your time.</p>

<p>So you&rsquo;re too busy for me (not to mention those in your life who care about you)?  Even though it&rsquo;s actually difficult not to do at all, it&rsquo;s fairly bothersome when someone thinks that they are inherently more important than everyone else.</p>

<p>Get over it, you&rsquo;re not that special.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was tagged for a meme by Ms. Q over at <a href="http://qmusings.com/blog">qmusings.com/blog</a>.  Thanks for the tag!  Although I&rsquo;m sure that many of my readers will know a lot of this already, I&rsquo;m sure that there are others who don&rsquo;t.  Besides, I&rsquo;m always up for a new idea for a post!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Each player must post these rules first.</p></li>
<li><p>Each player starts with eight random facts/habits about themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>People who are tagged need to write their own blog about their eight things and post these rules.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of your blog, you need to choose eight people to get tagged and list their names.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t forget to leave them a comment telling them they’re tagged, and to read your blog.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Here are the eight!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I played badminton in high school.  It&rsquo;s not your average backyard game.</p></li>
<li><p>I have more in common with Michael Bolton than one would think.  No, not that one, the one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space">Office Space</a> fame.  And he&rsquo;d be angry that you thought of that one first.</p></li>
<li><p>Before sitting on the toilet in a public restroom to do my business, I&rsquo;m not satisfied with the toilet seat covers that they provide.  So I put that one on first, then use about 10 squares of toilet paper to make sure that there is no butt-toilet seat contact happening.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried to read <em>A Tale Of Two Cities</em> when I was in 4th grade.  I gave up at about Chapter 3.  I guess that I wasn&rsquo;t as advanced as I thought!</p></li>
<li><p>I enjoy thrift shopping so much that I would estimate that I have at least 20 articles of clothing purchased from said thrift stores.</p></li>
<li><p>In high school I took a photography class where we got to shoot pictures using a film SLR and perform the entire process from shooting to developing to printing (and even mounting!)</p></li>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ve never been stung by a bee (or wasp or hornet or anything else that flies and has a stinger)</p></li>
<li><p>As of this moment, I have over 22 GB of music.  As well as the over 250 CD&rsquo;s that I legally bought them on.  (I obviously don&rsquo;t like that <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/14/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid/">Music Piracy Makes People Stupid</a>)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now I&rsquo;m supposed to tag eight people.  Okay so if they&rsquo;d like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Tiffany at <a href="http://www.xanga.com/TuMbaLiNa3">xanga.com/TuMbaLiNa3</a></p></li>
<li><p>William at <a href="http://eclectiastes.blogspot.com/">Writing is Fun and Productive</a></p></li>
<li><p>Rory at <a href="http://hamelife.com/">hamelife</a></p></li>
<li><p>Kiki at <a href="http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427">xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427</a> (I never realized, that upper and lower case is so annoying to type out!  And both you <em>and</em> Tiffany have it!)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Okay I totally ran out of ideas of who I wanted to tag.  So if you&rsquo;d like to be tagged, let me know and I can.  :P  It&rsquo;s a quick and interesting post.  It was actually pretty interesting to write as well since it made me think of interesting things about myself!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s what you should do when you&rsquo;re driving.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Weave</strong> - You mastered Gran Tourismo.  Life is just like that.  Everyone else is just a computer and they don&rsquo;t matter.  They&rsquo;re just obstacles in your way to the glorious finish line!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Swerve Suddenly and As Late As Possible</strong> - Don&rsquo;t make controlled lane changes in a reasonable amount of time.  Wait until the very last second and surprise everyone with what you&rsquo;re going to do.  The government and Google already know everything about you, why let them know what lane you&rsquo;re going to change to?  That&rsquo;s right, stick it to the Man.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yell At Other Drivers</strong> - Why bother being nice and full of good cheer?  Inside you want to yell at them anyways.  Old, young, black, white, hispanic, asian, gangsters, teenagers, rich, or poor they had no right to be there when you wanted to change into their lane.  So go ahead, give &lsquo;em an earful.  And you wouldn&rsquo;t want to make the tirade any less effective so go ahead and stare at them while you yell.  Don&rsquo;t worry about making sure not to hit someone else while you&rsquo;re not looking.  I already let them know that you&rsquo;re going to not be paying attention so they&rsquo;ll rightfully get out of your way.  Because it&rsquo;s all about you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cross Double Yellow Lines</strong> - They don&rsquo;t mean anything anyways.  What are lines anyways?  They&rsquo;re just contrived barriers between us and the world.  As a kid you wanted to color outside of the lines.  And now as a driver you want to cross them as many times as you can.  So let loose and cross them.  Or better yet, just straddle the lines and pretend that the lines are like the rail that guides your Autopia car at Disneyland.  That should be fun trying to sqeeze through when there are stupid cars on either side of you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cheat In The Carpool Lane</strong> - <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/">Cheaters 4 Life</a>?  Who cares, you need to get somewhere fast and the carpool lane was made for that.  It&rsquo;s not fair that people that decrease gas usage get to go faster.  You paid good money for your vehicle and you deserve to go as fast as you are able to.  Besides, you&rsquo;re more important than everyone else anyways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tailgate</strong> - Stick as close as possible to the car in front of you.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get into an accident,&rdquo; you say.  Sissy!  I always say if you can&rsquo;t kiss it, then you shouldn&rsquo;t be staring at its rear.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So follow these simple steps and you&rsquo;ll quickly be going the wrong way.  However, if you&rsquo;d rather be going the <strong>Wong</strong> way, use your head and don&rsquo;t do any of them!</p>

<p>Thanks, <a href="http://qmusings.com/blog/">Ms. Q</a> for the idea.  If it goes well (people enjoy it), I&rsquo;m sure that I will come up with more.  So let me know what you think of it.</p>
