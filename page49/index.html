I’d like to know whose bright idea it is/was to automatically restart your computer after the automatic updates! Oh sure, they give you a random pop-up message that essentially says “push this button or we’ll blow up your computer.” And it will appear for about 1 minute. So don’t you get up thinking that you’d like to go to the bathroom or anything like that. Nix the coffee breaks or the fresh air that you might like.</p> <p>Somehow they assume that you are not doing anything important. They don’t save the status of anything nor do they give you the option to opt out completely from automatic restarts. There’s a fine line between doing things for the benefit of the user and annoying them to no end such that they want you to just quit what you’re doing.</p> <p>It annoyed me before, and it continues to do so. You’d think that someone at Microsoft would get annoyed with it and change it, huh? I guess they don’t get annoyed. They’re too busy being litigious.</p> <p>//TODO: insert Apple fanboy snide Justin Long-type remark</p> <p>//TODO: insert Linux fanboy superiority over all remark</p> <p>//TODO: insert over-arching peace and love to all remark</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/getting-outside/"> Getting Outside </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 9</span> <p>So as someone who is inside of the office everyday, it is quite rare to get to experience what many people do on a day-to-day basis. And that is getting to be outside of a building.</p> <p>I’m a software engineer, whatever that means. Well I know what that means, but you don’t really care about it anyways. In any case that means that I spend much of my day sitting in a chair in front of a computer. There are some good and bad things about this.</p> <p><strong>Good</strong>: Don’t waste too much energy, not difficult physically. <strong>Bad</strong>: Can easily take in more calories than output which leads to fatness and an unhealthy lifestyle. Additionally, muscles can slowly atrophy such that when presented with a life or death situation where you need to grab onto a bar and hold up both you and your loved ones with one arm, you will all fall to an untimely demise.</p> <p><strong>Good</strong>: Do something that you enjoy - problem solving, thinking logically about solutions to somewhat concrete (but not real concrete) problems. <strong>Bad</strong>: Get lazy and don’t experience the other many many other good things in life.</p> <p><strong>Good</strong>: Don’t get sunburned, don’t get skin cancer. <strong>Bad</strong>: Look like a pale alien unless you actually go out. However, due to being inside and being so pale it would be even easier to get sunburned if sunscreen is forgotten.</p> <p>All in all, I don’t want to be that person that is always inside and becomes lazy. Good thing for trees that overgrow their boundaries and require chopping!</p> <p>Oh yeah I was outside over the weekend cutting branches off of trees that were touching the roof. And you know what? It wasn’t too bad. I felt like a woodsman. It’s not going to be a job of mine anytime soon, but I don’t mind finding a little Paul Bunyan in me.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/not-what-i-do/"> Not What I Do </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 5</span> <p>Do you ever think that so much of the time, conversations with other people consist of talking about what you do? Whether that means talking about what is going on in school, your current job situation, events that you’ve gone to, and so on, it’s always rather based on past experience.</p> <p>And do people read into it and see who you really are? Well probably sometimes they do. Nevertheless, it’s very likely that only your closer friends can actually talk about other things.</p> <p>When you talk to someone and you have to tell them what you do for a living, you know it’s not going to be a mind-blowing conversation. Especially if it’s because you broached the subject after running out of other things to say. It’s even worse if you have to talk about the weather.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/busyness/"> Busyness </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 3</span> <p>You, the one with the Bluetooth headset in your ear. You, doing anything you can to get a few more car lengths ahead on your commute. You, with your way of filling up every second of your time.</p> <p>So you’re too busy for me (not to mention those in your life who care about you)? Even though it’s actually difficult not to do at all, it’s fairly bothersome when someone thinks that they are inherently more important than everyone else.</p> <p>Get over it, you’re not that special.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/eight-things-count-em-up/"> Eight Things, Count 'Em Up </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 30</span> <p>I was tagged for a meme by Ms. Q over at <a href="http://qmusings.com/blog">qmusings.com/blog</a>. Thanks for the tag! Although I’m sure that many of my readers will know a lot of this already, I’m sure that there are others who don’t. Besides, I’m always up for a new idea for a post!</p> <ol> <li> <p>Each player must post these rules first.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each player starts with eight random facts/habits about themselves.</p> </li> <li> <p>People who are tagged need to write their own blog about their eight things and post these rules.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the end of your blog, you need to choose eight people to get tagged and list their names.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don’t forget to leave them a comment telling them they’re tagged, and to read your blog.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here are the eight!</p> <ol> <li> <p>I played badminton in high school. It’s not your average backyard game.</p> </li> <li> <p>I have more in common with Michael Bolton than one would think. No, not that one, the one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space">Office Space</a> fame. And he’d be angry that you thought of that one first.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before sitting on the toilet in a public restroom to do my business, I’m not satisfied with the toilet seat covers that they provide. So I put that one on first, then use about 10 squares of toilet paper to make sure that there is no butt-toilet seat contact happening.</p> </li> <li> <p>I tried to read <em>A Tale Of Two Cities</em> when I was in 4th grade. I gave up at about Chapter 3. I guess that I wasn’t as advanced as I thought!</p> </li> <li> <p>I enjoy thrift shopping so much that I would estimate that I have at least 20 articles of clothing purchased from said thrift stores.</p> </li> <li> <p>In high school I took a photography class where we got to shoot pictures using a film SLR and perform the entire process from shooting to developing to printing (and even mounting!)</p> </li> <li> <p>I’ve never been stung by a bee (or wasp or hornet or anything else that flies and has a stinger)</p> </li> <li> <p>As of this moment, I have over 22 GB of music. As well as the over 250 CD’s that I legally bought them on. (I obviously don’t like that <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/14/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid/">Music Piracy Makes People Stupid</a>)</p> </li> </ol> <p>Now I’m supposed to tag eight people. Okay so if they’d like:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Tiffany at <a href="http://www.xanga.com/TuMbaLiNa3">xanga.com/TuMbaLiNa3</a></p> </li> <li> <p>William at <a href="http://eclectiastes.blogspot.com/">Writing is Fun and Productive</a></p> </li> <li> <p>Rory at <a href="http://hamelife.com/">hamelife</a></p> </li> <li> <p>Kiki at <a href="http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427">xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427</a> (I never realized, that upper and lower case is so annoying to type out! And both you <em>and</em> Tiffany have it!)</p> </li> </ol> <p>Okay I totally ran out of ideas of who I wanted to tag. So if you’d like to be tagged, let me know and I can. :P It’s a quick and interesting post. It was actually pretty interesting to write as well since it made me think of interesting things about myself!</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page50">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page48">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
