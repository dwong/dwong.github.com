That’s a scary thought when I realize that the man who goes into the bathroom stall next to me didn’t use a toilet seat cover. Why is that scary? It’s scary because that means that man also very likely will not be that concerned about washing his hands thoroughly (if at all). So why do I care if this guy (who I have no idea who he is) has dirty nasty hands? Well because he is representative of lots and lots of people! There are scores of people walking around out there that similarly don’t care about keeping their butts from being disgustingly touched by countless other butts. There are scores of people who similarly will not care about how clean their hands are. And odds are, some of those people’s hands will affect me. Be it the fact that they’re preparing my food or that they’re going to shake my hand, they will affect me. So you see, it affects us all. There are so very many things that we do that are not just our business. Drinking and driving, sneezing, not turning on our car lights at dusk, AND SO ON AND SO ON!</p> <p>Amazing. And scary.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/stupid/"> Stupid? </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 6</span> <p>Well I don’t usually do these quiz things, but I saw <a href="http://digg.com/playable_web_games/Test_if_you_are_Stupid">this</a> on <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a> and just couldn’t resist. I said that I’d display it if I did alright so here it is:</p> <p><a href="http://www.stupidtester.com/index.php?im"> <img src="http://www.stupidtester.com/images/stupid.php?val=b0612371027ce81d" alt="StupidTester.com says I'm 10% Stupid!

Have you noticed the type of people who are willing to make comments or offer up their (often critical) opinion of something without actually trying to do something about it? I have come to notice that there are quite a fair amount of these type of people around.</p> <p>In the workplace they manifest themselves as the people who can’t help you accomplish something “because it’s not what they do”. Essentially they are perfectly content to let you struggle to do something that you have are new to when they have in fact been working there for years. They are perfectly comfortable letting you sweat and possibly make mistakes. Despite all of this, they will be the first ones to come to you if there is a problem. Accusing, questioning, belittling, it’s laudable, isn’t it?</p> <p>As a friend, they will be the person that can’t for the life of them ever decide on where to go or what to eat. They will be indecisive about it all. However, they will be the first and most vocal critic when something doesn’t turn out well. Even if things didn’t turn out well, they will suddenly realize that something else would have been a better choice for <em>some</em> reason. They will talk behind your back, they will complain to your face, they will whine, and they will generally not be a whole lot of fun to be around. More of a “friend” than a friend, I’d venture to say. And maybe not even that.</p> <p>In the open source community (and in other areas as well) they are the ones that will look at a product and immediately find the flaws. Granted the flaws should be found, but they at the same time do nothing but complain about the bugs that exist. They don’t try to help out in some way, and they don’t ever stop bringing up points that are already known. They will harp on the same issue as if that were the main point, even when it is not. They are generally ungrateful and quitters who wouldn’t know how to even start to formulate the product that they feel is insufficient. They are frankly useless.</p> <p>These are just examples. There are countless other examples out there that I’ve experienced or seen, but for whom I would rather not have to rack my brain to remember.</p> <p>There are so many instances of this type of person out there that one has to wonder how in the world they can get along. How can they have any type of relationship with anyone when they have such an unbalanced approach to things? How high can they really aspire when they don’t care to do anything for themselves?</p> <p>I just don’t really understand these types of people.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/facetious/"> Facetious </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 5</span> <p>[fuh-<strong>see</strong>-shuhs]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>Not to be taken seriously or literally.</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>You’re right, he did say that his room was as big as an elephant. However, you really need to lighten up because he was being facetious.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>This word is amusingly difficult for some people to say (namely <a href="http://www.xanga.com/godschild1427">Kiki Honda</a>), but it’s a word that you could use quite often. Essentially it is an equivalent of saying “just kidding” after you say something that was not meant to be taken seriously. However, one is usually intentionally facetious whereas “just kidding” has been known to just be appended after any type of statement. Facetious is only a word to describe what you are probably already doing. So now you know what to call it (hopefully anyways)!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/are-you-smarter-than-a-5th-grader/"> Are YOU Smarter Than A 5th Grader? </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 1</span> <p>I’m sure that many people out there have watched this show (if its claim that it had the highest premiere in the last 8 years is correct). Fox put it in that key spot right after one of their big hits (American Idol) so people who tune in for that are very apt to just leave their tv on.</p> <p>On the one hand I think that it’s a pretty lame show because it is almost entirely like <a href="http://www.millionairetv.com/">this show</a> even with the “lifelines” idea. On the other hand, I think that the shower can be interesting at times because we all (as adults) want to be “smarter” than a 5th grader.</p> <p>The show plays on pride as well as on the fact that there are a lot of things that we are very likely to forget in our lives. Even as someone who has recently finished schooling, I am still over 10 years removed from the 5th grade. That makes it hard to remember the purely knowledge-based answers such as when Columbus Day occurs or who the first president to be impeached was. However, there is just no excusing things that utilize simple principles such as finding the height of a triangle for a given area and base length.</p> <p>Which begs the question, are the majority of us really “smarter” than a 5th grader? We have more life experience (obviously). But I would tend to think that there are a lot of pretty dumb people out there who couldn’t reason as well as some 5th graders. Interesting and sad.</p> <p>I surely hope that I’m smarter than a 5th grader, but I’m not going to pound my head against the wall if I don’t know everything that they know. They probably won’t know it in 10 years either. I’m sure not going to sell myself out by taking $5,000 to say that on national television, though. I’m saving my 15 minutes for something more interesting, thank you very much.</p> <p><strong>Added 03/01/07 11:50 PM</strong></p> <p>Okay and what is up with these kids? What 10-year old has that much confidence to talk to adults like that?? I know that I sure didn’t. I am finding that they frankly get on my nerves. Anyways, because of these thoughts I also had to add this entry to the “Rant” category. I sure do love to use that category.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page74">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page72">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
