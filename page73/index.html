And at the very least it will provide me with a place to look up things that I have already searched for before. Now that I look at them, they seem rather rudimentary but far be it from me to keep something that I found useful from others.</p> <ul> <li> <p>(I’ve been trying to figure this one out for awhile.) To search for a string from one buffer in another buffer:</p> <ol> <li><strong>C-w</strong> (or <strong>M-w</strong>) the search string</li> <li>move to the buffer to search in</li> <li><strong>C-s</strong></li> <li><strong>M-y</strong></li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Synchronized scrolling: <strong>M-x scroll-all-mode</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Scroll other window:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>M-C-v</strong> scrolls down</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>M-C-V</strong> scrolls up</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Repeat a command numerous times: <strong>M-(number) (command)</strong> where you fill in (number) with a number and (command) with the command that you want to repeat. To use a number that is not a single digit you hold <strong>M</strong> while pressing the first number and then release <strong>M</strong> while pressing the rest of the numbers. An example: to kill 10 lines you would do: <strong>M-1 0 C-k</strong>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Notes: <strong>M</strong> is the Meta key (usually Alt or Esc depending on your operating system/settings) <strong>C</strong> is the Control key</p> <p>Emacs can be great if you know how to use it. :)</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/ostentatious/"> Ostentatious </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 19</span> <p>[os-ten-<strong>tey</strong>-sh_uh_ s]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>Characterized by intending to impress others with obvious and conspicuous show.</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>The engagement ring is a significant symbol to people but the 4 carat diamond that she keeps flaunting is simply ostentatious.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>This word is a synonym of “showy” and can be incorporated to more aptly describe someone’s behavior rather than saying that they are “showing-off”, as is more commonly done.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/rss-2/"> RSS </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 15</span> <p><strong>Read this</strong> (even if you think that this is going to be another nerdy entry)!</p> <p>You might learn something. I have found that there are a whole lot of people who have no idea what RSS is. That’s a shame because I think that a lot of them would find it to be useful.</p> <p>RSS stands for <strong>R</strong>eally <strong>S</strong>imple <strong>S</strong>yndication and is a really easy way to view the content for dynamic (frequently changing) websites. Good examples of websites that change frequently are news sites, blogs, etc.</p> <p>I’m sure that you could see the icons (like <a href="http://www.feedicons.com/">this</a>) around the Internet on web pages if you really looked. To utilize this technology, you have to understand what it is. Basically an RSS “feed” is a special link to a website that allows you to quickly see the content that is being changed on the site.</p> <p>So to start off, you obviously you need a feed reader (also called an aggregator or a news aggregator) in order to view the content of your feeds. If you use Firefox you can try <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/424/">this</a> or even subscribe with Firefox itself using “Live Bookmarks”. There are also tons more that you can find online. I tried one from <a href="http://email.about.com/od/rssfeedreaders/Find_the_Best_RSS_Feed_Readers_News_Aggregators.htm">here</a> that worked just fine. Once you have your reader install, you definitely need at least one site to get a feed from. You can find the links on pages, and often times these links will be sensed by your web browser and display an icon in the address bar that makes it easy to subscribe to. An example of a link would be: <strong>http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoingTheWongWay?format=xml</strong> Once you have this link, and input this into your reader in whatever way you are supposed to, you are up and running!</p> <p>To give you even more incentive of why you should do this, it turns out that you can use this for other blogging sites that you might not have thought of. For the xanga readers, you are essentially doing this when you read “Your Subscriptions”. You can incorporate xanga sites into your new RSS feed reader using links like <a href="http://www.xanga.com/rss.aspx?user=keleka">this</a> where you just replace the “keleka” part of that address with the user that you’re subscribing to. Add a whole bunch of those links and suddenly you have an easy way to read a whole bunch of different types of “subscriptions”. Happy reading!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/new-look/"> New Look </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 9</span> <p>After seeing <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/02/09/83-beautiful-wordpress-themes-you-probably-havent-seen/">this site</a> on <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a> I realized that I wanted a new theme. So here it is courtesy of one Wolfgang Bartelme. (For now anyways until I want to try out another one!)</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-lost-library/"> The Lost Library </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 8</span> <p>I like to say that I find humor in the everyday issues that arise. It’s there, you just have to know how to handle it. Here are some that I thought especially amusing.</p> <p><strong>The Library</strong> So I’m reading <em>Main Street</em> by Sinclair Lewis (as you can read about <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-reading/main-street/">here</a>) but I’m only halfway done. Additionally I have already renewed it the maximum number of times. So I go to the <a href="http://www2.anaheim.net/article.cfm?id=118">library</a> and find the other copy to check out. Just before I get to the line to check it out, this lady comes in with her son and a BOX of books to donate or something. Additionally the other librarian is occupied with someone who has a whole bunch of questions. Thus I ended up waiting along with this other lady. We also happened to be right next to their new self-checkout machine. The lady and I discussed that we should try it. So I did. I put my library card down to scan, and then I tried to scan the book. But I used the wrong bar code. In this time an old asian guy cut in front of us and took the librarian just as she was free from the question lady. I was tempted to say something but I had pity on him because he was old. Plus we were really looking at the machine so I guess it’s slightly valid. But only slightly. Anyways, I forgot that the library has their own bar code inside the front cover rather than the general bar code on the back. When I realized this, I tried again and it worked! Happily I walked out and set off the alarm. As soon as I heard it I burst into laughter. Now anyone who has heard me laugh knows that it is slightly unbecoming a person in a public library. Haha apparently I forgot to push the spine against the edge in my self-checkout process. Suffice to say I thought it was funny, but the people reading quietly might not have.</p> <p><strong>Lost</strong> I’m sure many people watched <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index">Lost</a> last night. And there are probably loads of posts about what happened and how exciting or dull or horrible it was. But I would venture to say that none of those blog posts are the same as this one. As I was watching the episode, I saw something that triggered my memory. That beach that Sawyer and Kate were on at the end when leaving the island…<strong>I was on that beach!</strong> Now you will probably want to know why or how I know this. Well this past summer I went to Hawaii for a couple of weeks with some friends. One of my friends has a place out there because he’s going to school there so he knows of all of these local spots. One day we went to this random beach where nobody was. There might have also been a sign somewhere that said to stay off, but I can’t exactly remember. Haha anyways it was fun and the beach was very picturesque. It was in this little cove/bay with a big house on one side. We snorkeled and looked at coral and stuff. It was quite nice. As we were leaving we also heard some people on horseback walking by and talking about how Lost was filmed there. I thought that was cool but thought nothing more of it until last night. I saw that beach and I am fairly certain that was the beach that we were at. Haha I thought that was awesome and hilarious. Well the hilarious part was telling my sister about it and her being incredulous that I <em>might</em> not have supposed to have even been there. :D</p> <p>Amusing stuff, my life. Anyone’s can be, you just need to know where to look.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page74">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page72">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
