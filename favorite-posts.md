Some were popular, some might have been lost in obscurity. But they're all good stuff in my opinion. Take a look-see.

### Life Lessons
  * [Sometimes Fight, Sometimes Flight](/sometimes-fight-sometimes-flight/) - Insects can teach you about life.
  * [Even Worse Than At First Glance](/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/) - A tirade about how buying fake things (more specifically purses :P) is worse than other things.
  * [Algorithm For Your Life](/algorithm-for-your-life/) - A quote from a computer science professor inspires me to think about how everyone thinks that they're right.
  * [Cheaters 4 Life](/cheaters-4-life/) - Once a cheater, always a cheater.

### Geek
  * [Apple:Geeks::Coach:Girls](/applegeeks-coachgirls/) - An analogy for some different folks.
  * [Difference Between Nerd, Geek, And Dork](/difference-between-nerd-geek-and-dork/) - While often used interchangeably, I don't think that these words are the same.

### Other
  * [The Long And The Short Of It](/the-long-and-short-of-it/) - Just get it done!
  * [In Your Own World](/in-your-own-world/) - People are strangest when they think that they're alone.
  * [Age - It's Just A Number](/age-its-just-a-number/) - Everyone ages, but some people care much more about it than they should.
