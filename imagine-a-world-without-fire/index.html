<div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever thought about how life can be different?  Well the other day I was thinking about what our world would be like without our friend fire.  And a very different world it would be.</p>

<p>It sure would be cold.  Haha and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Grylls">Bear Grylls</a> wouldn&#8217;t be able to teach us that fire is so important to survive in the wild.  Hopefully he would still eat crazy things on his show, though.</p>

<p>But once you get past the fact that we&#8217;d all be shivering perhaps you think that it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad because we could have electricity to warm us.  Electric heaters are all over the place, and they certainly do not require fire.  So we wouldn&#8217;t freeze to death and perhaps people could still live in Alaska.</p>

<p>However, there are <em>many</em> things that we would not have in our use.  We wouldn&#8217;t be able to have:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Cars - That sure would change our world, wouldn&#8217;t it?  They&#8217;re currently needed because gasoline engines use sparks to create a small combustion that, through a series of gears and mechanical parts, powers the wheels.  Granted I guess a spark isn&#8217;t exactly fire.  However I&#8217;m assuming that we would have gotten nowhere close to a spark if we didn&#8217;t have fire.</p></li>
<li><p>Food - How in the world would we cook it?  Would we be eating lots and lots of sushi?  Maybe just raw vegetables?  How animalistic!</p></li>
<li><p>Trains - Perhaps you don&#8217;t think that losing trains is any great loss.  I mean who really rides trains nowadays anyways?  Well lest you forget, trains still carry vast amounts of goods across land.  They&#8217;re often supposed to be more efficient than trucks because of their fixed rail.</p></li>
<li><p>Swords - How will the ninjas work?  They&#8217;ll be put out of a job.  But seriously, there would be no metallurgy as we know it because the metal needs to be shaped after being heated&#8230;by fire.  So kiss your katana goodbye.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Fire has got to get a mention in the race for best creation ever.  Without it we&#8217;d be a hungry bunch of people eating who knows what.  And we&#8217;d all be biking everywhere.  Well that would be a good thing because then we wouldn&#8217;t be obese.  But everyone would be walking around sweaty and smelly.  And to add insult to injury, everything metal would be ugly and rough.  Put a chunk of that in your ear and see how you like it.  Makes one a little more thankful for the things that we take for granted, does it not?  Still it&#8217;s kind of fun to have an imagination!</p>
