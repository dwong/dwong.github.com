<div class="entry-content"><p>You might wonder whether this entry is worth reading, especially if you are like most people who don&#8217;t even know what an algorithm really is.  Let me tell you, you should still read this because it applies to life.  Yes that&#8217;s right, <strong>life</strong>.</p>

<p>I had a professor at UCSD during my 3rd year of school for <a href="http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/classes/wi05/cse101/">CSE 101: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</a>.  On the first day, the class was packed as usual so everyone could get the syllabus.  This red-haired, awkward, sweaty man stood in front of us and mumbled about different things.  The biggest lesson that I learned from that class was on that first day.  It wasn&#8217;t concerning greedy, backtracking, or any other type of algorithm, though.  It was about life.  <a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/russell/">Professor Russell Impagliazzo</a> said</p>

<blockquote><p>If your algorithm is correct, you think that it&#8217;s correct.  If your algorithm is incorrect, you think that it is correct.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now you might wonder how in the world this applies to you let alone to <strong>life</strong>.  On that day way back when, I learned of a way to put into words something that I could see was true.  First let me define an algorithm.</p>

<blockquote><p>al·go·rithm      [al-guh-rith-uhm] –noun
a set of rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps, as for finding the greatest common divisor.</p></blockquote>

<p>Basically that means that an algorithm is a sequence of steps to do something.  It&#8217;s a method by which you accomplish something.  Now there are obviously correct algorithms, incorrect algorithms, efficient algorithms, inefficient ones, etc.  The truth in Professor Impagliazzo&#8217;s words are that people are going to always think that they&#8217;re right, even if they&#8217;re wrong.</p>

<p>Think about it.  Then think some more about it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true.  People always think that they&#8217;re right, even if in light of absolute truth they are wrong.  The reason is this: if people knew that they were wrong, then they would change so that they were right.  Only a fool of the greatest magnitude would remain wrong if they knew that they were wrong.  You&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find a fool such as this who knew deep-down in their very being that they were wrong about something and refused to change to what they knew was &#8220;right&#8221; (whatever that means in each case).</p>

<p>You&#8217;d be surprised at how much you can encounter this phenomenon in life.  I know that I was.  Now go, change the world!  Or at least realize that just because you think that you&#8217;re right, does not make it so.  If everyone approached problems and their own &#8220;algorithm&#8221; to life with such honesty, I daresay that we would end up striving for not only a better &#8220;algorithm&#8221;, but we would find that we desire <strong>absolute truth</strong>.  And no, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything&amp;btnG=Search">42</a> is not the answer that I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
