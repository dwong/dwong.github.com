While you are unmarried, you are either dating someone or you are not. If you’re not dating and happen to find someone that you want to date, then lucky you! The next categorization is you are either actively pursuing marriage or you are not. If you are, I think that you should want to go on interesting dates.</p> <p>Life isn’t dinner and a movie. Life is crazy and uncertain. It’s hard and difficult. Don’t you want to see how the person that you might spend the rest of your life with reacts? When they’re fording a river, do they get angry and upset with you? When you’re lost in the wilderness, do they get upset and frustrated? When you get frustrated with them, do they snap back? Find the worst in the person. Look for it as hard as you possibly can. Because if you can handle the worst, then you can definitely handle the best.</p> <p>If you aren’t as actively pursuing marriage then enjoy your dinner and movie.</p> <p>And if you’re not dating then good luck with being on your own and all of the issues entailed in CT’s <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/august/16.22.html">The Case For Early Marriage</a>.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/unions-will-get-you-for-sure/"> Unions Will Get You For Sure </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 12</span> <p>Labor unions have their origins as recently as the 18th century and in the United States of America in the 19th century. Quite simply a union is an entity that represents the collective interests of its members, often associated with workers of a similar profession. They were extremely important in yesteryear when “the Man” would snuff the very life out of people with his unyielding desire for more profit, even at the expense of people’s lives. Unions were an answer to this vileness. They allowed the workers to stand united against injustice and fight for their rights as human beings.</p> <p>But now <em>they</em> are getting despicable.</p> <p>In striving for (or at least claiming to strive for) the best possible situations for its members, the power-hungry leaders of unions are wielding weapons that they seem ill-equipped to handle. They know only to grab all that they can at no expense. There are so many different groups reaching for as much as they possibly can that they threaten the very structures upon which they stand!</p> <p>Unions make it easy for people to get as much as they can while also being protecting from punishment for not doing their job. Do you think that it’s a coincidence that the automakers in Detroit have huge unions and are also now going bankrupt? What about the education system (especially locally in southern California) that is floundering for money? Those teacher unions sure are big and powerful, aren’t they? I say that if they had just been reasonable about what they wanted and did (e.g., protecting from unjust terminations instead of deserved terminations) then perhaps we all would be a little bit better off.</p> <p>In the United States of America, we stand for things. Our Constitution says that we have rights. But those rights do not include a guaranteed source of income nor a completely secure job. We are not entitled to a house nor do we deserve free health care, but I digress. Our rights do include the ability to work as hard as you can to achieve things. And in our current society, it sure seems like we could get ride of unions and let the best of the workers survive (because they will always be sought after as good workers).</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/police-on-phone/"> Police On Phone </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 31</span> <p>I’m never a fan of people talking on their cell phones while they’re driving. And now I’m even less of a fan since it’s blatently against the law (whereas before it was just selfish to put others at risk). They definitely don’t drive as well, and that is a problem if I am driving near them.</p> <p>What if I see a police officer talking on their cell phone? Yeah, that’s another layer on top of that! They’re supposed to be working, and I am fairly confident in my ability to say that they’re not talking about work on their cell phone. They are also not doing their job as well. And that affects me just as much as it affects you.</p> <p>Nobody thinks that police are perfect. In fact they do all types of blatent things. They speed (even when not purposefully chasing someone), they are sympathetic, patronizing, power hungry, and on occasion corrupt.</p> <p>Well these are happy thoughts! I should have taken a picture of the officer and put her on blast. Hm on second thought, people with guns and power aren’t people that I want to annoy too much.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/diy-camera-bag/"> DIY Camera Bag </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jul 15</span> <p>So I recently purchased a Canon 40D. And there is a whole world of accessories out there. For the first couple of weeks I was keeping my camera in a FedEx bag because it is:</p> <ol> <li>inconspicuous</li> <li>cheap</li> <li>slightly padded</li> <li>water resistant</li> </ol> <p>That seems like a pretty good list to me! But alas I knew that it could not last. Unfortunately, bags (from companies that market them as camera bags) are fairly overpriced. Okay they’re not terribly expensive compared to the actual camera, but I rather enjoyed some of the unique aspects of my FedEx bag. I wanted to keep most of its positive attributes without having to bear the shame of actually holding a FedEx bag all of the time. Here is my bag.</p> <p>First I got:</p> <ol> <li>a canvas bag from my local Army/Navy military surplus store, which was a lot less rugged than I would have imagined</li> <li>craft foam and ripstop nylon fabric from JoAnn Fabric and Crafts (the higher quality foam that I wanted to buy online had an unfortunately prohibitive shipping cost that was higher than the foam itself)</li> <li>cardboard from a shipping box that I already had</li> <li>my sewing machine (which isn’t actually mine and which I had never used before this project)</li> <li>velcro with adhesive backing (I already had this)</li> </ol> <p><img width="500" title="Raw goods after purchase" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2637/3722068453_2f366f6cb5.jpg"/></p> <p>My idea was to create my own padded inserts to put into the canvas bag. I was going to use the craft foam as the filler, cardboard to stiffen the insert, and the nylon to wrap the whole deal. I made a number of inserts, and each of them had a similar method of creation.</p> <p>I guess that I didn’t take any pictures of my initial steps, but all I did was measure and cut the desired size of foam, cardboard, and nylon. I cut enough nylon to wrap the foam and cardboard like a present.</p> <p>Next I pinned the fabric according to how tight I wanted it to be around the foam. I generally was going for pretty tight because I thought that it would give it a more professional appearance. For the most part I think that was correct because I saw other examples of loosely wrapped inserts that people made online that did not look as nice.</p> <p><img width="500" title="Pinned fabric ready to be sewn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3419/3722886662_1141e0ac2c.jpg"/></p> <p>I inserted the foam and cardboard into the sewn nylon. This was actually one of the most difficult steps because the nylon was getting sewn with the intent of there being a tight fit. And a tight fit it was! I was able to eventually get all of them into their nylon sleeves, but some of them were quite difficult.</p> <p><img width="500" title="Foam going into the nylon" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3722072177_0c660c2227.jpg"/></p> <p>I then closed up the nylon and pinned it so that I could hand stitch it.</p> <p><img width="500" title="Pinned nylon ready for hand stitching" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3482/3722071175_766ef3f6af.jpg"/></p> <p>I used (or tried to use) a hidden stitch when I was hand stitching.</p> <p><img width="500" title="Hand sewn and completed foam insert" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2547/3722884054_56a8d4374e.jpg"/></p> <p>So I repeated that process a number of times so that I could have the appropriate number of bag inserts.</p> <p><img width="500" title="All of the completed inserts" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2583/3722887336_b66e28ace6.jpg"/></p> <p>My final step was to attach some velcro so that the pieces would hold their form. I’m still working on this step, though, because I have since found that the adhesive on the velcro is insufficient to keep the velcro on the nylon. I am pretty sure that using some kind of glue (maybe even fabric or super) will do the trick.</p> <p><img width="500" title="All of the materials completed!" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3472/3722888066_c450201797.jpg"/></p> <p><img width="500" title="Here's my camera bag" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3722257961_dcabf8cafd.jpg"/></p> <p>It’s fairly inconspicuous, modestly priced (total for everything is under $50 compared to over $100 for the bags that I wanted, and I have leftover material), padded, and now I have skills that I didn’t have before!</p> <p>Of course, if after reading this you decide that it’s still not worth it to sew all of the inserts yourself then you could just buy a commercial camera bag insert like <a href="http://amzn.to/P6vRtH">this one</a>, and put it into whatever bag you want.</p> <p>Inspiration came from: - <a href="http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Make_a_Stealth_Camera_Bag">Wired - How To Make A Stealth Camera Bag</a> - <a href="http://www.the3dstudio.com/blog_detail.aspx?id=640">Make Your Own Customized Camera Bag</a></p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page22">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page20">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
