While <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/5/algorithm-for-your-life/">everyone thinks that they’re right</a>, it seems like it’s getting easier (in this increasingly relativistic society) for people to change their mind after committing. They think that they’re right even when they go back on what they have previously said. They just rationalize away the facts.</p> <blockquote> <p>A man is only as good as his word</p> </blockquote> <p>This saying is often used, and it is one that has stuck with me over the years. Let’s face it, nobody appreciates someone who backpedals when the going gets tough. Neither friends, family, or employer will ever enjoy someone whose word is unreliable.</p> <p>If you find that you’re in an un<a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/142/tenable/">tenable</a> position because you overextended, perhaps you should have thought about it before you extended. When you are out there, you have to deal with the consequences. Next time remember to calculate the cost before giving your word. You just might be a better man (or woman, obviously) for it.</p> <p>It seems like it is time to man up.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/talking-to-strangers/"> Talking To Strangers </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 8</span> <p>It’s rather obvious that there isn’t anyone in the world that knows all of the other people in the world. It is therefore logical to conclude that each person will encounter strangers. Some people are good at talking to and interacting with them while others are completely unable to do it. Whether it is in line at the grocery store, waiting at the post office, going to a friend’s party (where there are some people that you know and some that you don’t), or sitting at a wedding banquet, it’s pretty easy to see how you handle strangers.</p> <p>And I find it rather strange that sometimes it’s actually easier to talk to strangers than it is to talk to people that you already know, especially those that you have not interacted with in awhile, and it’s especially true for those that you only know superficially. With people that you knew before, it seems like it gets awkward after the initial greeting whereas (depending on the strangers) it can be much more enjoyable to find out about a person from the start as the conversation continues.</p> <p>In my case, I often hope <strong>not</strong> to have to talk to people that I know superficially previously, especially in situations that will span a considerable time (like the aforementioned wedding banquet scenario). It is worlds less awkward to talk to strangers.</p> <p>Although if the stranger is out to rob, punch, or otherwise do harm to me I reserve the right to prefer a person that I know superficially. And if the stranger is dull and uninteresting, then I also reserve the right to hate talking to the stranger.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/understanding-domains/"> Understanding Domains </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 3</span> <p>If I could have your attention, I would rather like to quickly rant about something that I see all of the time.</p> <ol> <li>People pay for their own domain name</li> <li>Those same people want to get e-mail</li> <li>Those people proceed to register an e-mail address with some free webmail (e.g., Yahoo!, Google, etc)</li> </ol> <p>Why does require a rant? Because they paid for their own domain! Instead of having to register SomeOrganizationSomeGroup@gmail.com, they could very well just decide that they want to get SomeGroup@TheirDomain.com. Doesn’t that seem more appealing? Isn’t that more professional and more enjoyable? Yes, yes I think that we can all agree to that.</p> <p>The only argument that I can think of is that people want to be able to use the webmail clients to access their e-mail. I hear ya. But maybe more importantly, Google hears ya. I don’t want to be a Google salesman, but their <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">standard edition of Google Apps</a> is pretty free. And that will pretty much take care of you.</p> <p>Together, we can combat annoying-to-remember e-mail addresses. We can do it!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/dont-say-yes/"> Don't Say Yes </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 26</span> <p>Why is “no.” short for the word number?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/interesting-dates-rule/"> Interesting Dates Rule </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 21</span> <p>I date to get married.</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span class="c"># Marriage_Dating.py</span>

While you are unmarried, you are either dating someone or you are not. If you’re not dating and happen to find someone that you want to date, then lucky you! The next categorization is you are either actively pursuing marriage or you are not. If you are, I think that you should want to go on interesting dates.</p> <p>Life isn’t dinner and a movie. Life is crazy and uncertain. It’s hard and difficult. Don’t you want to see how the person that you might spend the rest of your life with reacts? When they’re fording a river, do they get angry and upset with you? When you’re lost in the wilderness, do they get upset and frustrated? When you get frustrated with them, do they snap back? Find the worst in the person. Look for it as hard as you possibly can. Because if you can handle the worst, then you can definitely handle the best.</p> <p>If you aren’t as actively pursuing marriage then enjoy your dinner and movie.</p> <p>And if you’re not dating then good luck with being on your own and all of the issues entailed in CT’s <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/august/16.22.html">The Case For Early Marriage</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page22">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page20">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
