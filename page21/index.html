I thought that the movie was amusing. It was not uproarious, but I was definitely amused. It was just in line with Monty Python and the Flying Circus (the TV show), of which I occasionally partake of. A TV show very well remembered for its SPAM.</p> <p>However everyone else did not find it amusing at all. As in, they thought the 90 odd minutes spent watching it were painful.</p> <p>Non sequiturs, absurdism, plays on words, and more. These are all things that make some people SPAMMILY laugh. And apparently some people cannot endure it at all.</p> <p>Humor is a strange thing. It is not the same for everyone. Often there is overlap. However other times there is something funny to someone and not funny at all to someone else. Sometimes the only way that we realize that we are alone in our humor is when we are laughing before we receive social cues that it’s not funny. Some people don’t even have any sense of humor at all.</p> <p>I don’t have any answers. I’m just asking the SPAM SPAM SPAM questions.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/garmin-cant-unlock-maps-error/"> Garmin - Can't Unlock Maps Error </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 27</span> <p>I was having a hard time with this recently. Maybe I’m dense or maybe this will be helpful to someone out there. If you have a Garmin GPS device, and it gives you an error that says “Can’t Unlock Maps” then try:</p> <ol> <li>Register online at <a href="http://my.garmin.com/">myGarmin</a></li> <li>Find your unlock codes</li> <li>Connect your device to your computer</li> <li>Create a file gmapprom.unl and paste the unlock codes into it, one to a line</li> <li>Put the file onto the Garmin device inside of the Garmin folder</li> <li>It is probably also a good idea to install and update software as necessary</li> </ol> <p>It was a very odd error because it seemed to happen out of nowhere. One minute the device was working fine, and then turning it off and on seemed to somehow allow that file to magically disappear. Not good, Garmin, not good. Don’t let it happen again!</p> <p>If that fix doesn’t work out for you, you can check out <a href="http://amzn.to/QO2zNz">some of the latest and greatest new Garmin devices</a> instead.  They look pretty snazzy.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/serious-gaming/"> Serious Gaming </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 24</span> <p>I enjoy a board (or sometimes card or tile) game just as much as anyone else. They are good clean fun that often test particular skills and attributes. There are games like scrabble and speed scrabble, which test your vocabulary and literacy; chess, which tests your planning capabilities; and Nertz, which tests speed and awareness.</p> <p>While I enjoy the games, I do not always enjoy the people that play the games. I mean what is up with people that take games too seriously? Games are fun, and I will play as hard as I can. But it is never appealing when things get out of hand.</p> <p>In particular there are some games that I cannot stand playing with other people because they tend to get much too involved in them. <a href="http://www.catan.com/">Settlers of Catan</a> is one of those games. Since so much of the game is the relationships between the players in the game, it is extremely susceptible to antagonism, back-stabbing, and bitterness. All lovely attributes. It is an excellent game if you want to see the ugly in people, that’s for sure. People cannot help but reveal themselves a little bit when it gets competitive.</p> <p>I will always remember a friend that I knew who was willing to give up a game (in that case basketball) because he was enticed to behave badly while playing. He thought that there were more important things in the world, namely his Christianity, so he gave it up. Admirable and encountered far too little nowadays.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/word-up/"> Word Up </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 16</span> <p>I don’t really find it too difficult that people can easily say one thing while doing another. While <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/5/algorithm-for-your-life/">everyone thinks that they’re right</a>, it seems like it’s getting easier (in this increasingly relativistic society) for people to change their mind after committing. They think that they’re right even when they go back on what they have previously said. They just rationalize away the facts.</p> <blockquote> <p>A man is only as good as his word</p> </blockquote> <p>This saying is often used, and it is one that has stuck with me over the years. Let’s face it, nobody appreciates someone who backpedals when the going gets tough. Neither friends, family, or employer will ever enjoy someone whose word is unreliable.</p> <p>If you find that you’re in an un<a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/142/tenable/">tenable</a> position because you overextended, perhaps you should have thought about it before you extended. When you are out there, you have to deal with the consequences. Next time remember to calculate the cost before giving your word. You just might be a better man (or woman, obviously) for it.</p> <p>It seems like it is time to man up.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/talking-to-strangers/"> Talking To Strangers </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 8</span> <p>It’s rather obvious that there isn’t anyone in the world that knows all of the other people in the world. It is therefore logical to conclude that each person will encounter strangers. Some people are good at talking to and interacting with them while others are completely unable to do it. Whether it is in line at the grocery store, waiting at the post office, going to a friend’s party (where there are some people that you know and some that you don’t), or sitting at a wedding banquet, it’s pretty easy to see how you handle strangers.</p> <p>And I find it rather strange that sometimes it’s actually easier to talk to strangers than it is to talk to people that you already know, especially those that you have not interacted with in awhile, and it’s especially true for those that you only know superficially. With people that you knew before, it seems like it gets awkward after the initial greeting whereas (depending on the strangers) it can be much more enjoyable to find out about a person from the start as the conversation continues.</p> <p>In my case, I often hope <strong>not</strong> to have to talk to people that I know superficially previously, especially in situations that will span a considerable time (like the aforementioned wedding banquet scenario). It is worlds less awkward to talk to strangers.</p> <p>Although if the stranger is out to rob, punch, or otherwise do harm to me I reserve the right to prefer a person that I know superficially. And if the stranger is dull and uninteresting, then I also reserve the right to hate talking to the stranger.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page22">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page20">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
