<div class="entry-content"><p>I just realized that this is the second article that is car-related within the past few days or so. Anyways, I just wanted to say that I am not getting a new car or am involved in the process at all. It&#8217;s mere coincidence.</p>

<p>Anyways, onward with the post.</p>

<p>So I don&#8217;t know about most people, but I do know about me. And one thing that I know is that I absolutely cannot stand it when I can&#8217;t figure something out. For example, I cannot stand it when I lose something because that is in essence a puzzle (the location of something) that I cannot figure out. It will consume me to no end!</p>

<p>So for the past couple of months, I have been slightly perturbed by a puzzle. No it&#8217;s not a puzzle in the normal sense. Basically I would drive around southern California and obviously see lots of cars. Now occasionally I would see something that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/213/473834904_46f6265569_o.jpg" alt="op.permit" />
I blurred out the important information because I just yanked the picture from some random site.</p>

<p>Now I always wondered what it was. Now obviously you can see what it is now because I found a picture for you and it&#8217;s not moving at 70 mph. But imagine it as something 6 inches square and on the back window of a car and moving exceptionally fast. Plus you don&#8217;t want to get too close to it else you might get into an accident! And although I would see them around some of the time, I never really saw them in a context by which I could actually look at it.</p>

<p>And so my mind imagined what it could be. Some of the things that I thought of were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#8217;s a secret club for something and that badge indicates that they&#8217;re in the club</p></li>
<li><p>My eyes were playing tricks on me</p></li>
<li><p>It was a new hip brand of clothing/auto accessories/whatever</p></li>
<li><p>It was a humorous bumper sticker type thing</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So basically my mind would stew about it for a few minutes every time that I saw one of these things. And this went on for a couple of months! Of course I tried to remedy this all by searching for it on the Internet, but you can imagine how hard it would be to find it. Basically all I knew was that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was red</p></li>
<li><p>It had a number on it</p></li>
<li><p>It was on the back of cars</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now those are some pretty broad and sweeping search terms by which my search engines could not help me with. Alas, I was to be forever confounded&#8230;</p>

<p>Until <strong>finally</strong> one Sunday I saw one of these on the back of a car in the parking lot of <a href="http://www.fcbc.org/">First Chinese Baptist Church</a>. I took the minute or so to read it and discovered that it&#8217;s a DMV Temporary Operating Permit! I promptly felt satisfaction seep over me like a gentle wave. :P But truly I do enjoy it when things make sense, and those moments when realization set in are very nice indeed.</p>

<p>Even with the knowledge of what these were, it was still hard to find information about them online. I must admit that I still don&#8217;t know all that there is to know about these, but I don&#8217;t really care that much anymore because I know <strong>what</strong> they are. Hopefully if someone is in the same conundrum as I was, they will happen upon this page and be satisfied as well.</p>

<p>Anyways, it&#8217;s interesting because I&#8217;m like that with other things as well. The truth really does set you free! (Even if it&#8217;s a small dose of it.)</p>
