Anyways, I just wanted to say that I am not getting a new car or am involved in the process at all. It’s mere coincidence.</p> <p>Anyways, onward with the post.</p> <p>So I don’t know about most people, but I do know about me. And one thing that I know is that I absolutely cannot stand it when I can’t figure something out. For example, I cannot stand it when I lose something because that is in essence a puzzle (the location of something) that I cannot figure out. It will consume me to no end!</p> <p>So for the past couple of months, I have been slightly perturbed by a puzzle. No it’s not a puzzle in the normal sense. Basically I would drive around southern California and obviously see lots of cars. Now occasionally I would see something that looks like this:</p> <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/213/473834904_46f6265569_o.jpg" alt="op.permit"/> I blurred out the important information because I just yanked the picture from some random site.</p> <p>Now I always wondered what it was. Now obviously you can see what it is now because I found a picture for you and it’s not moving at 70 mph. But imagine it as something 6 inches square and on the back window of a car and moving exceptionally fast. Plus you don’t want to get too close to it else you might get into an accident! And although I would see them around some of the time, I never really saw them in a context by which I could actually look at it.</p> <p>And so my mind imagined what it could be. Some of the things that I thought of were:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It’s a secret club for something and that badge indicates that they’re in the club</p> </li> <li> <p>My eyes were playing tricks on me</p> </li> <li> <p>It was a new hip brand of clothing/auto accessories/whatever</p> </li> <li> <p>It was a humorous bumper sticker type thing</p> </li> </ul> <p>So basically my mind would stew about it for a few minutes every time that I saw one of these things. And this went on for a couple of months! Of course I tried to remedy this all by searching for it on the Internet, but you can imagine how hard it would be to find it. Basically all I knew was that:</p> <ol> <li> <p>It was red</p> </li> <li> <p>It had a number on it</p> </li> <li> <p>It was on the back of cars</p> </li> </ol> <p>Now those are some pretty broad and sweeping search terms by which my search engines could not help me with. Alas, I was to be forever confounded…</p> <p>Until <strong>finally</strong> one Sunday I saw one of these on the back of a car in the parking lot of <a href="http://www.fcbc.org/">First Chinese Baptist Church</a>. I took the minute or so to read it and discovered that it’s a DMV Temporary Operating Permit! I promptly felt satisfaction seep over me like a gentle wave. :P But truly I do enjoy it when things make sense, and those moments when realization set in are very nice indeed.</p> <p>Even with the knowledge of what these were, it was still hard to find information about them online. I must admit that I still don’t know all that there is to know about these, but I don’t really care that much anymore because I know <strong>what</strong> they are. Hopefully if someone is in the same conundrum as I was, they will happen upon this page and be satisfied as well.</p> <p>Anyways, it’s interesting because I’m like that with other things as well. The truth really does set you free! (Even if it’s a small dose of it.)</p> </div> <section> <div id="amzn-assoc-ad-9cfbbbe0-6312-4668-bbea-0252c5c9265a"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=9cfbbbe0-6312-4668-bbea-0252c5c9265a"></script> </section> <section> <h1>Comments</h1> <div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </section> <div class="related"> <h2>Related Posts</h2> <ul class="related-posts"> <li> <h3> <a href="/bingo-number-generator/"> Bingo Number Generator <small>Feb 4</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/grand-canyon/"> Grand Canyon <small>Mar 10</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/change-2005-toyota-tacoma-manual-transmission-shifter-bushing/"> Change 2005 Toyota Tacoma Manual Transmission Shifter Seat And Bushing <small>Feb 8</small> </a> </h3> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/embed.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
