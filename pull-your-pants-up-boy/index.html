<div class="entry-content"><p>Alright so we had a fire drill the other day.  And it was annoying.  The sirens were piercingly loud.  I guess that&#8217;s good because you don&#8217;t want to have your earphones in and listening to music so that you don&#8217;t hear the alarm when it goes off.  Nevertheless the fact of the matter was that there wasn&#8217;t a fire and it did hurt my ears.</p>

<p>When you go down the stairs for the fire drill, it&#8217;s mild because nobody is actually trying to get away from a fire.  I can only imagine that some people would panic in the case of a real fire and try to run by people.  These are probably the same people that need to learn what I have to say <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/27/on-driving/">On Driving</a>.  They&#8217;re the ones zooming by, cutting you off, and still getting to the destination not a minute or two faster than you.  In a fire drill they&#8217;re gonna run as fast as they can, knock people over, and cause general pandemonium.  Great.</p>

<p>But those thoughts weren&#8217;t the most disturbing of the day.</p>

<p>Many people exited the building (it&#8217;s a 5 story one with multiple companies), and as we&#8217;re standing in the grass I see someone (from my company) who is standing there with his arms raised.  They&#8217;re resting on his head.  Maybe he was stretching.  Maybe he was subtly trying to get someone&#8217;s attention.  Maybe he was trying to touch the sky.  How do I know?  But whatever he was doing, all I know is that his shirt was too short (so it raised along with his arms), and his pants were sagging too much.  And there was a great view of his man hair (if you know what I mean, pubic hair if you don&#8217;t) if you&#8217;re into that.  But I&#8217;m not into that.  Not at all.  And I don&#8217;t know too many people who are.  So that made me unhappy and disgusted.</p>

<p>So remember, kids, to pull up your pants.  Especially if you&#8217;re at work.  Especially if you&#8217;re raising your arms up and trying to grab birds out of the air.  You know who you are.</p>
