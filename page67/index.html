It gets you going in the morning by providing energy, and this in turn gets your body’s metabolism to change from its “sleep” mode to its “day” mode. And that’s good for you because the more energy you burn the more food you can consume. So you are essentially burning calories simply by being awake rather than having to work them off through exercise. Granted you’re not going to lose all of your excess weight, but it does help.</p> <p>What I like to do is break my fast twice. I’d like to think that it gives me double the benefits, but I am probably completely wrong about that. That’d just be another case of justifying my actions. So I get up in the morning and mosey my way on downstairs. I eat a bowl of <a href="http://www.kraftfoods.com/PostCereals/hbo.htm">Honey Bunches of Oats</a> with some fresh fruit (either bananas (cheap from <a href="http://www.costco.com">Costco</a>!) or frozen blueberries). That happens at around 8:15 AM every weekday. That’s pretty normal right? I’m breaking that fast from about 9 PM the previous night until 8:15 AM that day. That’s a hefty 11 hours and 15 minutes fast every single day!</p> <p>The thing is…</p> <p>I also break the fast from 8:25 AM (after I finish the cereal) to approximately 11 AM. That’s a not-quite-as-hefty 2 hours and 45 minutes fast. But the thing is…I’m fasting twice <strong>five times a week!</strong></p> <p>Some people laugh at me about that.</p> <p>Okay everyone that I tell that to laughs at me about that.</p> <p>Okay <a href="http://www.adropofwater.net">some people</a> say that I eat first breakfast and second breakfast. And the aforementioned people, whoever they might be, also say that I’m like a hobbit. Because (truth be told) I also have second lunch in the afternoon.</p> <p>Finally I must admit that I actually don’t eat as much as I was for awhile because <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/15/separate-yourself/">I have been setting aside time and closing out the world</a> in order to work more efficiently.</p> <hr/> <p>NOTICE TO ANYONE IN THE ORANGE AREA NEAR THE 55-91 JUNCTION:</p> <p><a href="http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Home.asp">Chick-Fil-A</a> is having <strong>free</strong> breakfasts on Fridays for the next few weeks in order to spread the news about their <a href="http://www.chick-fil-a.com/cfa.asp?template=map&amp;transaction=locMap&amp;recordId=1892">new location</a>! I swung by there today and got myself some <strong>free</strong> <a href="http://www.chick-fil-a.com/MenuItems.asp?MenuItem=threePcMinis">Chick-n-Minis</a>! I’m spreading the love for Chick-Fil-A because their food is good, they close on Sundays to observe the Sabbath, and they are giving out <strong>free</strong> breakfast right now on Fridays. And that’s niiiice.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/a-possibly-new-idea-for-american-idol/"> A (Possibly) New Idea For American Idol </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 4</span> <p>So I’m not sure if it is indeed a new idea, but I recently have been thinking that I’d like the producers of <a href="http://www.americanidol.com/">American Idol</a> to consider a new idea. After watching the show tonight as well as thinking about <a href="http://www.myspace.com/starvationforsanjaya">extreme measures to vote certain contestants</a>. My idea is they should implement a new system for their voting.</p> <p>They need to allow for the ability to eliminate the bad people, not <strong>just</strong> vote for the best. The bad thing about the current system is that you get people like <a href="http://www.americanidol.com/contestants/season6/sanjaya_malakar/">Sanjaya Malakar</a> who lots and lots of people want off, but can’t <em>really</em> do anything about it except starve.</p> <p>To allow for this, it would be so simple for the producers to modify. They would add another phone number for each contestant that would be to vote against a particular person. Then they could simply subtract the negative votes from the positive votes. I don’t see how this could possibly be a bad thing for the show. I still think that the best person will end up winning. And just like the current system, a very large group of people still have the ability to circumvent the system if they’re organized and thorough. It seems like a good idea to me. But a lot of things have seemed like a good idea to me so that’s nothing new.</p> <p>However if they implemented it, I know that I’d be calling to vote off Sanjaya. And I don’t even call at all now.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/trying-out-some-advertisements/"> Trying Out Some Advertisements </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 3</span> <p>Now I don’t want to be a sneaky bugger (even though some might say that about me anyways), so I will tell you upfront that I’m trying out Google AdSense.</p> <p>Additionally I have added a site search at the top that will allow you to not only search the web, but it will also allow you to search only my site! I think that’s a fairly useful feature if you were so inclined to wonder about what whether I’ve written about a certain topic.</p> <p>Now why would I add these features? Well I’ll also be honest with you about something else. I actually don’t hardly ever click on ads (even the nice text ads that aren’t obnoxious). But I also have realized that they’re not too bad to click on. It doesn’t hurt me to look at an advertisement site (especially when it actually <strong>is</strong> related to what I’m looking at). Anyways so if nothing ever comes of it, then that’s fine. But I figured that I should stop wondering if I could make enough money blogging, and I should just try it out. Google ads are generally pretty good about finding out about content and delivering meaningful ads. I can tentatively vouch for that.</p> <p>Additionally, I have also added a bunch of support buttons to my site. I think that although they generally detract from the main purpose of the site (which is to post content from my mind), they warrant their place. Each of these components are either important to the support of this blog or to my personal usage. They are simply a sign of things that I approve of. These are totally unrelated to the advertisements that I’m trying out, and all are freely available for you to use.</p> <p>Feedback on these topics as well as on any other topic on this site is always welcome.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/precocious/"> Precocious </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 2</span> <p>[pri-<strong>koh</strong>-sh_uh_ s]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>Unusually advanced or mature</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>While the rest of the class was struggling with their work, the precocious child had finished already and was causing a ruckus because he was bored.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>This is definitely one of those words that is very descriptive of what you’re trying to say. You can try to explain what you mean with this word in many more words, but this word displays much more brevity. And that is always good.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/unnecessary-incentive/"> Unnecessary Incentive </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 1</span> <p>Now passing judgment on people is not always good as we all know. Of course people nowadays want there to be no judgments whatsoever. And let’s be honest, that doesn’t really make any sense at all. It makes about as much sense as getting rid of the court system, doesn’t it?</p> <p>Well I saw something today, and it is a case that definitely makes me think about some judgment passing.</p> <p>Now far be it from me to know if someone actually understands what it means to be a Christian. But I have to wonder about it when I see a sign on the street that proclaims that they should come to church in order to win a car. They direct you to their website where they have <a href="http://www.ineedarevolution.com/easter/">a page dedicated to their contest</a>.</p> <p>To me, that seems outlandish where they feel that they have a need to offer people physical prizes in order to attract them to come to their church. Some out there will say that it’s a good thing to get people into church no matter how they got there. But is that really the right attitude?</p> <p>Seems ridiculous to me, and I hope that this is not a growing trend.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page68">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page66">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
