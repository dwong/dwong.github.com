  <div class="entry-content"><p>Music is a wonderful thing.  Throughout the ages, it has been created and enjoyed by man.  It has ranged from the beat of the drum to the clang of the cymbal to the strings of the violin.</p>

<p>In and of itself, music is innocuous.  It is the words, lyrics, and association that we attach to these series of notes that give them their meaning.  That brings me to the point where I wonder at the derision of specific genres of music.  While I&rsquo;m not a fan of every type of music (hardcore rock comes to mind), I do wonder sometimes at the motivation that people have for judgment.</p>

<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve often heard both Christians and non-Christians deride so-called Christian rap (aka Gospel Rap, Holy Hip Hop, and so on and so on).  Basically it&rsquo;s music that identifies itself as hip hop with lyrics that could in someway be identified as Christian.  It seems that people mock it because they think that the combination of a culture of sex, drugs, and money that is often associated with the hip hop culture cannot be combined with what they perceive as stodgy, conservative Christianity.  Since they cannot go hand in hand, it&rsquo;s worthy of derision.</p>

<p>And yet I can pretty readily admit that I listen to and enjoy some of the music in this genre.  While I&rsquo;m most definitely a fan of a wide variety of music (classic pop, r&b;, show tunes, alternative, trance, and more), some of my favorite artists might very well be clumped into this group.</p>

<p>Why I enjoy Christian rap:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Like-mindedness</strong> - While a lot of the groups and artists that I listen to don&rsquo;t constantly mention the name of Jesus Christ, I enjoy listening to them because I know that we come from the same place.  We&rsquo;re more alike than different because we are more fundamentally similar than to someone who does not share the faith.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lyrics</strong> - Hardly anybody on the radio even has interesting lyrics.  It&rsquo;s the same old game of sex, money, and women.  Soulja boy?  Hardly stimulating.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creativity</strong> - So granted, I don&rsquo;t listen to a lot of underground secular rappers.  But in my experience it seems that Christian groups that I listen to are much more wiling to try new things than the factory-pressed tracks heard on the radio.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keeping It Real</strong> - This might seem extremely strange in a genre that many people think of as utterly fake, but I think that they&rsquo;re being more real when they create their works.  They&rsquo;re using their entire being, from their background in the &lsquo;hood all of the way to their conversion because of Christ.  They&rsquo;re not trying to hide these things, and I can respect that.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So I don&rsquo;t enjoy ever single Christian rapper that I listen to.  Far from it.  But the same is true across the board for all musical genres.  Personally I enjoy those Christian rappers that like to talk about life, just like how I like to talk about life here on this blog.  But that is my own taste.</p>

<p>Even though it&rsquo;s been popular in society to mock the Jesus that I believe in (Jesus is my homeboy anyone?), I won&rsquo;t be party to it.  I rather wonder why people act that way.  Is it because (in the case of Christians) they&rsquo;re insecure about being so in-your-face about the faith?  Or perhaps it&rsquo;s because (in the case of non-Christians) they haven&rsquo;t experienced the same change?</p>

<p>Whatever it is, I might not ever know.</p>

<p>Some of my favorites are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>4th Avenue Jones (which have disbanded)</p></li>
<li><p>L.A. Symphony</p></li>
<li><p>Pigeon John (formerly of L.A. Symphony)</p></li>
<li><p>Grits</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past weekend I completed the <a href="http://runlongbeach.com/site5.aspx">Long Beach half marathon</a>.  While it&rsquo;s probably no big deal to some people, it was my first so it was a big deal to me.</p>

<p>Someday I want to run a marathon (some might say that it&rsquo;s on my &ldquo;bucket list&rdquo;).  I figured that a half marathon would be a good place to start off at since the most that I&rsquo;d run previous to my training was a 10K.</p>

<p>So it&rsquo;s done, now I just need to figure out when I want to spend $100 to run 26.2 miles.  Oh how I relish the opportunity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to Marie Callender&rsquo;s in order to get a pie (<a href="http://www.mcpies.com/our_food/featured_pie.php">they&rsquo;re on sale</a>) a few days ago.  Specifically I went to go get a Double Cream Blueberry.</p>

<p>As I was walking out of the house I made sure that I had enough money, and I also grabbed a handful of coins off of my bookcase because I was running low in my car.  So I get to Marie Callender&rsquo;s and order my pie.  Since I had a tin (they require a 50 cent deposit on them to make sure that people bring &lsquo;em back) the cost was $6.99.  I looked in my wallet, and I saw that I had one each of $20, $10, $5, and $1 bills.  Sweet!  So I grabbed the $5 and the $1 bills and started rummaging in the handful of change that I grabbed out of my car as I was getting out.  I saw that I had 3 quarters, 3 dimes, a nickel and 3 pennies.  (On another note, is it sad that I still remember all of this a few days later?)  Sweet again!  I can make over 99 cents with the coins that I had so I didn&rsquo;t have to get more change.</p>

<p>The cashier starts looking at the coins (understandable since she needs to count it out), and she starts to mildly protest.  I wonder what&rsquo;s up, and she asks me what &ldquo;this&rdquo; is?  She&rsquo;s holding up one of the quarters.  And&hellip;it&rsquo;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_yuan">Chinese coin</a>.  Oh my, I am slightly embarrassed.  Then I realize that I&rsquo;m going to have to take <strong>all</strong> of the money back since I couldn&rsquo;t make another 25 cents.  Haha I felt pretty silly having to take it back and give over the $10 bill.  Thankfully the cashier didn&rsquo;t seem to mind too much.  She did make a comment that it was Japanese or something, to which I mumbled, &ldquo;Er yeah something like that.&rdquo;  I was too sheepish to correct her.</p>

<p>The whole time after that I was thinking that she might have thought, &ldquo;What is this Asian guy pulling here?&rdquo;  So Marie Callender&rsquo;s cashier, if you&rsquo;re reading this, it was an honest mistake.  I wasn&rsquo;t trying to cheat.  It&rsquo;s also kind of unrelated, but I&rsquo;m really not that Asian that I usually carry around Asian currency with me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It should come as no surprise that you are not always correct.  And this even though you probably think that you <strong>are</strong> always correct (as I talked about in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/">Algorithm For Your Life</a>.</p>

<p>When you have a wrong opinion and are faced with facts, are you willing to alter your thoughts on the matter?  It&rsquo;d be hard to find someone that doesn&rsquo;t think that sounds reasonable.  But it might come as a surprise to you that I feel as if I see that people are not always so.  But why?</p>

<p>I think that a large part of the difficulty is that changing is tough to do.  It is a rather outright admission that you are wrong.  Nobody wants to be wrong.  It&rsquo;s also admitting that you don&rsquo;t know it all.  And don&rsquo;t we all wish that we could be a know it all?  (That&rsquo;s a bit sarcastic for those that can&rsquo;t sense it since I obviously think that <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/01/experience-matters/">Experience Matters</a>.)</p>

<p>Be willing to change, you might find that it&rsquo;s not as hard or stressful as having to know everything.</p>
