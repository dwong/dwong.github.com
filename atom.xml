    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is pretty easy to read about how to conceptually do something.  It is equally easy to read about how other people have actually done something.  It is an entirely different task to do that something.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/596/finishing-my-first-marathon/">running a marathon</a>.  It is often referenced in terms of doing something difficult with perseverance.  Yes it is true that it is difficult.  Yes it is true that you need some perseverance (some more so than others simply because they aren&#8217;t as ready).  <em>Talking about it</em>, though, requires experience.</p>

<p>When I was younger I chafed at the idea that I could not understand something simply because I had not done it yet.  When I was learning how to drive a car I doubted my parents when they told me that I needed experience.  They essentially claimed that they were better at driving simply because they had done it longer than I have.  I reasoned that I understood the laws better than they, and in fact I probably had better reactions than they did.  So it seemed fairly reasonable that I could drive as well (if not better than) they could.  My how I was young and foolish!  (On a side note I must remember that being foolish is very often associated with being young.)</p>

<p>I have learned that yes, experience does matter.  Nobody buys a book about trading stocks from an author who has never traded stocks.  Nor does one buy a cookbook by someone who could not boil water.  Neither do I want to hear someone extol the virtues of running a marathon if they have not actually run a marathon.  Do you want to talk about running a marathon?  Then <strong>run a marathon</strong>!  It will give your words more weight.  Alternatively there are countless other examples that you could draw from to prove your point.</p>

<p>Experience does not linearly increases abilities, but I have come to appreciate that experience brings a measure of wisdom.  Oh that&#8217;s just great, next thing I know I am going to start calling kids &#8220;sonny&#8221; and talk about the &#8220;good ol&#8217; days&#8221;.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I traveled to Gdansk, Poland in the dead of winter for work.  I was there during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_European_cold_wave">2012 European Cold Wave</a>.  I mean you know it&#8217;s bad if the Poles thought that it was especially cold!  The news broadcast warnings that they should notify the police if they saw people outside sleeping (because they might actually have been dead!).  A far cry from sunny southern California to be sure!</p>

    <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/on-going-on-a-date-guy-version/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-28T00:21:54-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/on-going-on-a-date-guy-version</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Take this list and write it down.  Believe in it.  Win it.  Done and done, happily ever after.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Wing It</strong> - This is especially important early on.  Everyone likes a man who can improvise.  It&#8217;s probably just better to ask her what she wants to do when you pick her up.  Since you know, she might be very particular about the food she eats, the activities that she does, and so on and so forth.  So don&#8217;t plan anything specific because it will just be a waste of your time.</li>
<li><strong>Split The Bill</strong> - This is the modern age.  Women are the equal of men.  And you know what that means!  She wants you to treat her like an equal.  Plus you know, it might not work out.  Either way you get to save more of your hard-earned money in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Have Her Drive</strong> - She probably likes driving anyway.  This will let her practice since girls aren&#8217;t as good at driving.  Oh and you&#8217;re going to do whatever she wants anyway.  So really, everyone wins.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Talking As Much As Possible</strong> - Just stare.  She&#8217;s beautiful, huh?  Talking isn&#8217;t necessary.  She&#8217;ll be won over by your style, charisma, and wonderful cologne.</li>
<li><strong>Talk About Yourself</strong> - When you do have to talk (e.g., she asks you a question) then just make sure to keep the topic of conversation on something that you know.  And what do you know better than yourself and your favorite things?</li>
<li><strong>Come On Strong</strong> - Only the serious-minded know that the secret to winning the girl is to either go laid back cool or full-court press.  So if you are going to the latter route then you better go all of the way.  5 course candle-lit dinner, sunset walk on the beach, hired Mariachi band,  horse-drawn carriage.  Go big or go home, buddy.  Everything that you see in those romantic comedies is fair game.  Failing those things, <em>at the very least</em> contact her early and often after the date.  Show her how much you want more.  She&#8217;ll reciprocate I&#8217;m sure.</li>
</ol>

It encourages us to relive the days of our youth. Its success continues because it is easy to understand, requires little investment in equipment, and is fantastic fun for all ages.

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I did not take most of these pictures because I was actually playing in the tournament. Nevertheless I helped when I could, especially for the group shots. So thank my wife for the pictures.</p>

    <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/crom-the-one-who-loveshates-his-girlfriend/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-15T01:10:39-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/crom-the-one-who-loveshates-his-girlfriend</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So we know that Crom <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/914/crom-the-one-with-the-girlfriend/">has a girlfriend</a>.  It seems like he likes her a lot.  He talks to her on a very frequent basis as far as I can tell.  I rather wish that I did not observe so much about him!</p>

<p>From what I can recall, he talks to her at least twice a day.  Every.  Single.  Day.  The weird thing is that I get the impression that they also see each other quite often (I would guess 4 times a week).  Is that the weirdest thing?  No not by a long shot.  There are plenty of people out there who cannot get enough of seeing and talking to each other.  And I am sure that there are plenty of middle-aged men with girlfriends out there as well.</p>

<p>No, the weirdest thing is the fact that when he talks to her it is sugar, honey, lovey, and dovey for a little while.  You know what I mean.  He has his boyfriend voice (ugh, I feel gross just typing that) and talks softly and gently while saying nice things.  However, for whatever reason this almost always turns on a dime, and he seems to get very irritated/impatient with her.  He will start to tell her the things that she needs to do (e.g., get out of bed and get ready for work) or he will quickly bail out on the conversation (e.g., I really need to get back to work).</p>

<p>I know that no couple is perfect because <strong>nobody is perfect</strong>.  So it is not that strange that they could have this conversation every so often.  However it does seem strange to me that it seems to happen every time that they talk.  And remember, they talk a couple of times a day everyday!  I have no idea what it is about these people!  I have so many questions.  Why does he do it?  Why does she put up with it?  Why are they still together after all of this time??</p>

<p>Perhaps he is starting to feel guilty about using work time for personal reasons.  Perhaps he just gets tired of talking on the phone.  (Now mind  you he usually just stays out here in the cubicles while he is talking so everyone can hear his conversation.)</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, I guess that we&#8217;ll just have to chalk it up to another mystery of <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/tag/crom/">Crom</a>.  I doubt that I could ever understand.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuing with the trip to Asia, here are some pictures from the historical city of Xi&#8217;an.  It is one of the oldest cities, and it was heavily used as the capital of China for several dynasties.  Nowadays, though?  It&#8217;s not as prominent.  Nevertheless it had its moments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">telephone</a> (although apparently its original name is a bit more offensive!) is a simple game that teaches us a valuable lesson.  From it we learn that people are awful at accurate transmission of information.  In the case of the game, it leads to amusement and fun when finding out how quickly and drastically words will change.</p>

<p>However the game is not as funny in its everyday depictions.  We reference people who reference other people who read about some research piece in a magazine.  Other people pass along hearsay as common knowledge, and we grow to have a distorted view of truth.  We might see these everyday ranging from <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5847591/10-stubborn-food-myths-that-just-wont-die">common myths about food</a> to <a href="http://www.boundless.org/2005/articles/a0001126.cfm">common myths about (unmarried couples) living together</a>.  Despite our best intentions at accuracy there is something that we will never learn from the telephone game as well as we should - we are just not able to effectively relate information.  It is somehow beyond our grasp.  We tend toward chaos simply because we are human.</p>

<p>(Then again that is why coming upon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls">exceptions </a>to this rule is so amazing!)</p>

<p>Lesson to be learned?  You cannot relay information well so do it more judiciously.  That is, information that you do not relay does not have the opportunity to prove that you are speaking falsely.  Don&#8217;t trust me?  There are more <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2017:28&amp;version=NASB">reputable sources</a>.</p>
