    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is pretty easy to read about how to conceptually do something.  It is equally easy to read about how other people have actually done something.  It is an entirely different task to do that something.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/596/finishing-my-first-marathon/">running a marathon</a>.  It is often referenced in terms of doing something difficult with perseverance.  Yes it is true that it is difficult.  Yes it is true that you need some perseverance (some more so than others simply because they aren&#8217;t as ready).  <em>Talking about it</em>, though, requires experience.</p>

<p>When I was younger I chafed at the idea that I could not understand something simply because I had not done it yet.  When I was learning how to drive a car I doubted my parents when they told me that I needed experience.  They essentially claimed that they were better at driving simply because they had done it longer than I have.  I reasoned that I understood the laws better than they, and in fact I probably had better reactions than they did.  So it seemed fairly reasonable that I could drive as well (if not better than) they could.  My how I was young and foolish!  (On a side note I must remember that being foolish is very often associated with being young.)</p>

<p>I have learned that yes, experience does matter.  Nobody buys a book about trading stocks from an author who has never traded stocks.  Nor does one buy a cookbook by someone who could not boil water.  Neither do I want to hear someone extol the virtues of running a marathon if they have not actually run a marathon.  Do you want to talk about running a marathon?  Then <strong>run a marathon</strong>!  It will give your words more weight.  Alternatively there are countless other examples that you could draw from to prove your point.</p>

<p>Experience does not linearly increases abilities, but I have come to appreciate that experience brings a measure of wisdom.  Oh that&#8217;s just great, next thing I know I am going to start calling kids &#8220;sonny&#8221; and talk about the &#8220;good ol&#8217; days&#8221;.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I traveled to Gdansk, Poland in the dead of winter for work.  I was there during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_European_cold_wave">2012 European Cold Wave</a>.  I mean you know it&#8217;s bad if the Poles thought that it was especially cold!  The news broadcast warnings that they should notify the police if they saw people outside sleeping (because they might actually have been dead!).  A far cry from sunny southern California to be sure!</p>

    <link href="http://dwong.github.com/on-going-on-a-date-guy-version/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-28T01:21:54-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dwong.github.com/on-going-on-a-date-guy-version</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Take this list and write it down.  Believe in it.  Win it.  Done and done, happily ever after.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Wing It</strong> - This is especially important early on.  Everyone likes a man who can improvise.  It&#8217;s probably just better to ask her what she wants to do when you pick her up.  Since you know, she might be very particular about the food she eats, the activities that she does, and so on and so forth.  So don&#8217;t plan anything specific because it will just be a waste of your time.</li>
<li><strong>Split The Bill</strong> - This is the modern age.  Women are the equal of men.  And you know what that means!  She wants you to treat her like an equal.  Plus you know, it might not work out.  Either way you get to save more of your hard-earned money in the process.</li>
<li><strong>Have Her Drive</strong> - She probably likes driving anyway.  This will let her practice since girls aren&#8217;t as good at driving.  Oh and you&#8217;re going to do whatever she wants anyway.  So really, everyone wins.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Talking As Much As Possible</strong> - Just stare.  She&#8217;s beautiful, huh?  Talking isn&#8217;t necessary.  She&#8217;ll be won over by your style, charisma, and wonderful cologne.</li>
<li><strong>Talk About Yourself</strong> - When you do have to talk (e.g., she asks you a question) then just make sure to keep the topic of conversation on something that you know.  And what do you know better than yourself and your favorite things?</li>
<li><strong>Come On Strong</strong> - Only the serious-minded know that the secret to winning the girl is to either go laid back cool or full-court press.  So if you are going to the latter route then you better go all of the way.  5 course candle-lit dinner, sunset walk on the beach, hired Mariachi band,  horse-drawn carriage.  Go big or go home, buddy.  Everything that you see in those romantic comedies is fair game.  Failing those things, <em>at the very least</em> contact her early and often after the date.  Show her how much you want more.  She&#8217;ll reciprocate I&#8217;m sure.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I did not take most of these pictures because I was actually playing in the tournament. Nevertheless I helped when I could, especially for the group shots. So thank my wife for the pictures.</p>

    <link href="http://dwong.github.com/crom-the-one-who-loveshates-his-girlfriend/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-15T01:10:39-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://dwong.github.com/crom-the-one-who-loveshates-his-girlfriend</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So we know that Crom <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/914/crom-the-one-with-the-girlfriend/">has a girlfriend</a>.  It seems like he likes her a lot.  He talks to her on a very frequent basis as far as I can tell.  I rather wish that I did not observe so much about him!</p>

<p>From what I can recall, he talks to her at least twice a day.  Every.  Single.  Day.  The weird thing is that I get the impression that they also see each other quite often (I would guess 4 times a week).  Is that the weirdest thing?  No not by a long shot.  There are plenty of people out there who cannot get enough of seeing and talking to each other.  And I am sure that there are plenty of middle-aged men with girlfriends out there as well.</p>

<p>No, the weirdest thing is the fact that when he talks to her it is sugar, honey, lovey, and dovey for a little while.  You know what I mean.  He has his boyfriend voice (ugh, I feel gross just typing that) and talks softly and gently while saying nice things.  However, for whatever reason this almost always turns on a dime, and he seems to get very irritated/impatient with her.  He will start to tell her the things that she needs to do (e.g., get out of bed and get ready for work) or he will quickly bail out on the conversation (e.g., I really need to get back to work).</p>

<p>I know that no couple is perfect because <strong>nobody is perfect</strong>.  So it is not that strange that they could have this conversation every so often.  However it does seem strange to me that it seems to happen every time that they talk.  And remember, they talk a couple of times a day everyday!  I have no idea what it is about these people!  I have so many questions.  Why does he do it?  Why does she put up with it?  Why are they still together after all of this time??</p>

<p>Perhaps he is starting to feel guilty about using work time for personal reasons.  Perhaps he just gets tired of talking on the phone.  (Now mind  you he usually just stays out here in the cubicles while he is talking so everyone can hear his conversation.)</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, I guess that we&#8217;ll just have to chalk it up to another mystery of <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/tag/crom/">Crom</a>.  I doubt that I could ever understand.</p>

    <updated>2011-10-12T01:44:56-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dwong.github.com/the-telephone-problem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">telephone</a> (although apparently its original name is a bit more offensive!) is a simple game that teaches us a valuable lesson.  From it we learn that people are awful at accurate transmission of information.  In the case of the game, it leads to amusement and fun when finding out how quickly and drastically words will change.</p>

<p>However the game is not as funny in its everyday depictions.  We reference people who reference other people who read about some research piece in a magazine.  Other people pass along hearsay as common knowledge, and we grow to have a distorted view of truth.  We might see these everyday ranging from <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5847591/10-stubborn-food-myths-that-just-wont-die">common myths about food</a> to <a href="http://dwong.github.com/item?0,http://www.boundless.org/2005/articles/a0001126.cfm">common myths about (unmarried couples) living together</a>.  Despite our best intentions at accuracy there is something that we will never learn from the telephone game as well as we should - we are just not able to effectively relate information.  It is somehow beyond our grasp.  We tend toward chaos simply because we are human.</p>

<p>(Then again that is why coming upon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls">exceptions </a>to this rule is so amazing!)</p>

<p>Lesson to be learned?  You cannot relay information well so do it more judiciously.  That is, information that you do not relay does not have the opportunity to prove that you are speaking falsely.  Don&#8217;t trust me?  There are more <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2017:28&amp;version=NASB">reputable sources</a>.</p>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
<li>Sew nylon strap through swiveling hook with a box stitch</li>
<li>Attach locking carabiner to swiveling hook</li>
<li>Thread shoulder strap through both nylon strap and carabiner</li>
<li>Cut original Canon strap, leaving enough room on the thick portion for a grommet</li>
<li>Cut hole in thick portion, not too close to the edges</li>
<li>Insert and attach grommet</li>
<li>Attach skinny nylon strap of the original Canon strap to the camera</li>
<li>Attach grommet on thick portion of original Canon strap to the swiveling hook</li>
</ol>


<h4>Parts</h4>

<ul>
<li>Grommet kit ($7, Michael&#8217;s)</li>
<li>Included Canon strap (free or less than $10, eBay)</li>
<li>Swiveling hook ($4, Home Depot)</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/Rz7V35">Locking carabiner</a> ($5, Amazon)</li>
<li>Nylon strap (free, cut from an old messenger bag)</li>
<li>Thread (negligible, already had)</li>
<li>Shoulder strap (free, already had)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I enjoyed making this, especially when compared to the ~$60 R-Strap.  It saved me some money.  (Then again, that small amount of money saved hardly gets me very far in terms of purchasing new lenses!)</p>

<p>My main issues with the commercial R-Strap is its price and its attachment to the tripod mount.  I don&#8217;t particularly trust screws to hold my camera, especially since it swings and hangs there.  Additionally, it is quite difficult to put a camera on a tripod with something else attached to its tripod mount!  This strap attaches to one of the metal tabs that is normally used for holding up the camera.  It&#8217;s integral to the camera body, and I trust that it won&#8217;t break.  If it does break, then it would drop just as it would have if I were only using the original Canon strap.  In any case it is a pretty secure setup, and I will be using this for the time being.</p>

<p>A lot of my inspiration is from the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.comhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Safer-DIY-R-Strap/">Safer DIY R-Strap</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People want their private space.  People <strong>need</strong> their private space.  Some people have even been known to go crazy without it!</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are people who do not seem to really understand the whole personal space thing.  My co-worker, Crom, is exactly one of those people.  I don&#8217;t know if I would go so far as to say that he enjoys getting all up in people&#8217;s business (and by business I mean personal space), but he definitely does it the majority of the time.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s even worse for the short ones!  He is pretty tall (over 6&#8217;) and has a bit of a portly stomach, which I would imagine would make shorter people feel like he is intruding into his space even more if his stomach is near their face!  Thankfully I am not at that height.  Interestingly enough <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/914/crom-the-one-with-the-girlfriend/">his girlfriend</a> <strong>is</strong> pretty short at (I&#8217;m estimating) 5&#8217;2&#8221;.</p>

<p>The best part is getting to watch Crom do this to other people.  Unbeknownst to him, I observe him and amuse myself  with all of it.  What can you learn from all of this?  Beware of the watchful ones since they are probably analyzing and making fun of you in their head.</p>

    <link href="http://dwong.github.com/the-inevitability-of-friendship/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-11T01:50:24-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dwong.github.com/the-inevitability-of-friendship</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like having friends.  They usually share some connection with you and are able to share in experiences with you.  Laughter, excitement, and life all happen when friends are around.</p>

<p>But something that I am continuing to learn is that friendships will change.  As in, you will change.  Or the friend(s) will change.  Or circumstances will change.  Maybe you just stopped trying.  Maybe they slighted you in some way.  All of this adds up to your friendship changing.</p>

<p>So apparently I am much worse than I thought I would be at maintaining friendships.  People have come and gone in my life.  Some have left a mark (and amusingly many have not).  Many are now gone.</p>

<p>Now looking back on times long gone, I realize how difficult it would have been to predict how my life would have turned out.  Even if things had been planned or more effort would have been invested, I know that it would have been quite difficult to overcome what has turned out to be the biggest reason for all of the change: <strong>life</strong>.</p>

<p>Proofreading this post I have come to the conclusion that this could have been written by a lovesick high school kid secretly talking about some girl he had a crush on who just stopped talking to him even though all indications were that she liked him.  Not that I have that experience, I&#8217;m just saying.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays it is all the rage to get medical help to correct our weight loss.  From the LAP-BAND to gastric bypass to diet drugs, we as a society are looking for a way to get rid of those extra pounds hanging on our bodies.  I am not sure if I am just blessed to be able to do things that others cannot or if I really am seeing with clear vision, but it seems that people could do with choosing to do things correctly (albeit with more difficulty).  That is, they should diet and exercise instead of going for the quick fix.</p>

<p>It seems strange to me that the LAP-BAND will compare itself to diet and exercise by saying that diet and exercise do not work because people fail.  While I am sure that is true, that is not a particular reason why the LAP-BAND is better since that comparison is effectively saying that it is better for a person if they cannot choose to do something themselves.  On the other hand I think that people need to make that choice.  With freedom they have a responsibility to live with their choices.  I would not want another person telling me what I can and cannot do.  The most marked change is the one that comes from within when they <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/476/having-the-desire/">have the desire for change</a>.  They need to want it so badly that they actually get out and do something to enact that change.</p>

<p>The part that amazes me so much (and which is the impetus for this post) is that people who do end up getting medical help take pride in that.  How can you be proud that you resorted to get surgery to get skinnier??  Absurdity of absurdities!  Can you be <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/229/proud-of-nothing/">proud of things that you have no control over</a>?  Well&#8230;apparently people are.  Still, the fact that people are will always boggle my mind.</p>

    <link href="http://dwong.github.com/paying-for-software/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-16T01:14:37-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://dwong.github.com/paying-for-software</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> so it is no surprise that I use and advocate it when I can.  I would not consider myself <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/10/fanaticism/">fanatical</a> about it (i.e., I will and do use non-free software).  However, in my experience and observation I have noticed how difficult it is for people to pay for software.  How else can you explain how we can pay hundreds to thousands of dollars for a computer only to refuse to pay $20 for a particular desired application?</p>

<p>It seems that people are confused about developers, especially those that create free software.  Maybe they do not think that the developers are entitled to compensation because they are releasing free software.  I guess that in part it is due to the difference between the definitions of free (as in zero cost) and free (as in liberty).  Software developers are (surprise!) real people that need to make a living as well.  In a world that contains both free (as in zero cost) and free (as in liberty) software, people need to understand both in order for them to see where the software developer is coming from.  So perhaps we can all remember that paying for software should be seen just like we should view all other purchases - if it satisfies our requirements for purchasing then we should go ahead and do that.</p>

<p>All of these words when this abbreviated comic (originally <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/blog/apps">here</a>) says it perhaps even better:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Farmers have used branding for a long time as a way to mark their property, namely their livestock.  They knew that if their livestock wandered off (as they invariably would) then they needed a way to make sure that they had a way to get their property back.  It was a wonderful idea for the farmers.  But what did the livestock think?  I am sure that the livestock were not huge fans of the process.  Having a hot metal brand pressed into their skin was probably not on their list of highlights from their lives.  But they didn&#8217;t have a choice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/179/applegeeks-coachgirls/">Apple stickers</a> on cars, Gucci emblems on purses (<a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/70/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/">real or fake</a>), and perhaps even soccer jerseys with their large corporate sponsorship logos are all things that seem to follow this idea.  It&#8217;s a strange idea really because we are paying companies so that we can advertise for them.  If I walked up to you and asked if you would pay me money in order to wear a necklace with my name on it you would think that I am crazy.  Is the idea that we would pay to display companies&#8217; logos that far off from this example?</p>

<p>Nowadays people have a choice.  And I am always surprised when people  choose self-branding.  Instead of viewing it as branding, though, they want to display an affiliation, love the cachet/exclusivity, or perhaps just do it because  others do it also.</p>

<p>In truth, we all do it to some degree.  We buy T-shirts, computers, and cars that all have logos on them.  So I would doubt very much if anyone is exempt.  But thinking about it sure does make one think.  And it sure does give me a different perspective of &#8220;brand&#8221; names.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of outsourcing?  Besides the TV show, there is much to the issue of outsourcing.  At the heart of it, outsourcing basically means getting someone else to do the work.  When used in terms of software, it usually refers to having someone overseas in India or China write the code according to what the desired behavior is.  For the past decade or so there has been talk (and more than talk) about how all of the software created is going to be outsourced rather than done in America.  In fact I remember during my undergraduate studies there was a survey taken of my class to find out whether talk of the outsourcing of our future careers scared us into going into other fields.  At the time it did not seem too pressing of an issue.  Maybe it is because we were not aware enough of what was really going on in the industry yet.  In any case, the reason that all of the outsourcing was talked about is basically because  American computer programmers are much more expensive than those in other countries.</p>

<p>So what does this mean to me (or you) unless you are getting laid off as your work is being moved overseas?  I think it still is quite relevant.  Because it is not just losing a job that causes me to stop.  It is really the fact that I have seen people purposely choose to outsource their own projects!   In their new ventures they have opted to outsource the programming to some other group or country.  As for me, though, I do not think that I would ever outsource my projects.</p>

<p>Reasons why I would not outsource my projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I set out on a side project because <strong>I want to learn</strong> something.  Maybe I want to learn a new programming language.  Maybe I just want to go through the experience of building something in particular.  After all, <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/366/experience-matters/">experience matters</a>.  And I want that experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Outsourcing something essentially <strong>tramples upon the lower state of others</strong>.  While I am sure that I do this in an indirect way (e.g., by buying anything made in China), it still seems worse to me to directly order other people to do things.</p></li>
<li><p>When I do something myself, I get this odd <strong>satisfaction from doing something myself</strong>.  I do not imagine that everyone else feels the same way.  In fact I would guess that most other people just want whatever it is to work.  But I love being able to look at something (even if it is imperfect) and knowing that I had a huge hand in doing it.</p></li>
<li><p>There seem to be a myriad of reasons why working with people in another country (or even other people in general) would be difficult.  This includes things like <strong>language, time difference, and general misunderstandings</strong>.  As the sayings goes: &#8220;If you want something done right you have got to do it yourself.&#8221;  Because trusting others to do things that you want to do is not ever going to work out just as you have planned.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>While people can (obviously) do whatever they want with their projects, I am pretty sure that I would not do such a thing.  In fact it flies in the face of who I want to be.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What up guy at the soda fountain using your definitively clear plastic water cup in order to get some soda?   How are your ill-gotten gains?   Tasty I hope.</p>

<p>I am sure that you have a good reason for doing what you do.  The world has probably beaten and berated you.  You deserve some of this sweet nectar.  Besides, you figure that it is a chain restaurant, and the syrup water that you are taking is really only worth cents to them.  If you have a job it probably is not the one that you really want (I mean not everyone gets to sleep in, tell people what to do, and have no pressure on them whatsoever).  Or maybe you don&#8217;t get paid as much as you know that you deserve (it must be because people don&#8217;t understand how much you are worth).</p>

<p>Some people will never learn to have integrity <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/6/cheaters-4-life/">no matter what they are doing</a>.  Some people will sell it for a little cup of soda.  Then again <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2025:29-34&amp;version=NASB">others have sold much more valuable things for not much more in return</a>.</p>

<p>So keep at it, sir.  I know that you will no matter what I say.  And good luck on that whole job of your dreams thing.</p>
