    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I live in California.  It&rsquo;s a state with plenty of fantastic attributes, but it has its drawbacks.  There are the earthquakes.  It&rsquo;s really crowded.  Housing is unpleasantly expensive.  And we get droughts.  In fact we&rsquo;ve going through one for the past few years.  At this point, there are starting to be more fines and publicity about what we should do to help.</p>

<p>My neighbor is not really having any part of it.  He waters his lawn at least 8 times each week (from what I can tell).  I know because I&rsquo;m up early in the morning feeding the baby so I hear both his first and his second watering (which he does at least 4 times each week).  He&rsquo;s also out there watering with a hose in the twilight hours sometimes, just to get those spots that the sprinklers might have missed.  As you&rsquo;d imagine, his lawn is lush and green.  It&rsquo;s nice, it really is.  He mows it on average twice a week.  He loves his lawn!</p>

<p>We both redid our lawns at the same time a couple of years ago.  We originally got the same grass, but after a year or so, he got too fed up with it because it would get brown spots.  He didn&rsquo;t like that.  So he killed it and redid it again with different grass.  Like I said, he loves his lawn.</p>

<p>Now usually this wouldn&rsquo;t be a big deal.  Except for that whole drought that we&rsquo;re going through.  So while everyone else might be trying to save water, my neighbor has a nice green lawn.  To me, it seems pretty wasteful, and I wonder how much water he uses (I&rsquo;m guessing a lot).  Overall it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for him to do it.  It&rsquo;s more expensive for him, it&rsquo;s bad for Californians, and it&rsquo;s not even par for the rest of the neighborhood (nowadays anyway).</p>

<p>So why does he do it?  It&rsquo;s his American dream.  It&rsquo;s where he places his hope, and it&rsquo;s much more important to him than any of this other stuff.  I feel bad for him because it seems like such an ephemeral hope.  I really think that there could be more.  I sure hope there is anyway!</p>
