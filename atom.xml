It was bound to happen eventually, right? The illness came with a few bouts of vomit along with some rather unpleasant less-than-sleepful nights. All is as expected. Except that I was also infected with said illness!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I’m not saying that I don’t ever get sick. Because I do. I definitely do. In fact when I do get sick it seems like it’s extra awful. But it still catches me by surprise that I can get sick so easily by such a little baby. Conceptually I know that germs are much tinier than either of us, and size does not matter at all when getting sick. But something about it still surprises me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully it only took me out for a day. But boy was it an unpleasant day!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Colorado 2015</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/colorado-2015/"/> <updated>2016-01-21T22:34:34-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/colorado-2015</id> <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;galleria&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/denver_co_springs-1_b343371.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-title=&quot;&quot; data-description=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/Thumbs/denver_co_springs-1_f568.jpg&quot; height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;33&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/denver_co_springs-2_3f90224.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-title=&quot;&quot; data-description=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/Thumbs/denver_co_springs-2_eb94.jpg&quot; height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;60&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/denver_co_springs-3_6445d04.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-title=&quot;&quot; data-description=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/Thumbs/denver_co_springs-3_8ceb.jpg&quot; height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;60&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/denver_co_springs-5_a19f7dc.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-title=&quot;&quot; data-description=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/Thumbs/denver_co_springs-5_baef.jpg&quot; height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;34&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/denver_co_springs-8_35f9894.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img data-title=&quot;&quot; data-description=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/Thumbs/denver_co_springs-8_0fa8.jpg&quot; height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;60&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was our first time flying with a child, and it didn’t go too badly!

Just FYI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I was changing the Bear’s diaper, she grabbed the changing pad (as she is wont to do). There was already some poop in the old diaper that I was changing so I moved that away before she could touch it. However, while I had her butt in the air (off of the changing table) she proceeded to poop some more. This new poop was fresh stuff (unlike the poop in the diaper which was more pebble-like). I was in a bind because one hand was holding up her legs, but the poop was going to land on the changing table. In order to save the poop from landing on the changing table, I had to just go for it. I decided that catching it with my hand was better than letting it fall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And thus I achieved another parenting milestone: I willingly chose to catch poop with my bare hand (thankfully not watery in any way).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ah parenthood, gotta love it.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Moving Around (Or The Crawling Mischievous Bear)</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/moving-around-or-the-crawling-mischievous-bear/"/> <updated>2015-12-30T15:27:02-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/moving-around-or-the-crawling-mischievous-bear</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Bear is starting to push herself backwards.

I had initially enjoyed Octopress because it seemed to get me up and running in a short amount of time. It also included a pretty nice default theme along with some tools to use. However, the project seems to have been on a bit of a hiatus, and I think that it would be better in the long term if I just start to use Jekyll itself. While I lose some of the included tools in the Octopress rake tasks, I can probably re-write some of them myself now that I’m more comfortable with Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did the following items while migrating, which maybe someone will find useful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;syntax-highlighting&quot;&gt;Syntax highlighting&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rouge.jneen.net/&quot;&gt;Rouge&lt;/a&gt; is now the default syntax highlighter with Jekyll 3.0. After converting to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://liquidmarkup.org/&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt; tags and running jekyll serve, I got the following error:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Liquid Exception: undefined method `t&#39; for nil:NilClass in /Users/blah/blah/YYYY-MM-DD-some-post.markdown/#excerpt &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turns out that I couldn’t have syntax highlighting for the whole post. I didn’t dive too deep into it, but my simple fix was to add a first paragraph to the post so that there would be an excerpt available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;theme&quot;&gt;Theme&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon&quot;&gt;Lanyon&lt;/a&gt; theme. At the time that I did it, I had to manually apply &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon/pull/149&quot;&gt;this pull request&lt;/a&gt; to get it working with Jekyll 3.0.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>The Baby Is Killing Me</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-baby-is-killing-me/"/> <updated>2015-08-22T22:20:28-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-baby-is-killing-me</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have been trying to keep 1 bottle feeding for the baby each day, but lately it’s been disastrous.

It’s a state with plenty of fantastic attributes, but it has its drawbacks. There are the earthquakes. It’s really crowded. Housing is unpleasantly expensive. And we get droughts. In fact we’ve going through one for the past few years. At this point, there are starting to be more fines and publicity about what we should do to help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My neighbor is not really having any part of it. He waters his lawn at least 8 times each week (from what I can tell). I know because I’m up early in the morning feeding the baby so I hear both his first and his second watering (which he does at least 4 times each week). He’s also out there watering with a hose in the twilight hours sometimes, just to get those spots that the sprinklers might have missed. As you’d imagine, his lawn is lush and green. It’s nice, it really is. He mows it on average twice a week. He loves his lawn!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We both redid our lawns at the same time a couple of years ago. We originally got the same grass, but after a year or so, he got too fed up with it because it would get brown spots. He didn’t like that. So he killed it and redid it again with different grass. Like I said, he loves his lawn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now usually this wouldn’t be a big deal. Except for that whole drought that we’re going through. So while everyone else might be trying to save water, my neighbor has a nice green lawn. To me, it seems pretty wasteful, and I wonder how much water he uses (I’m guessing a lot). Overall it doesn’t make sense for him to do it. It’s more expensive for him, it’s bad for Californians, and it’s not even par for the rest of the neighborhood (nowadays anyway).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why does he do it? It’s his American dream. It’s where he places his hope, and it’s much more important to him than any of this other stuff. I feel bad for him because it seems like such an ephemeral hope. I really think that there could be more. I sure hope there is anyway!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Getting Out</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/getting-out/"/> <updated>2015-07-11T16:06:22-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/getting-out</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’re getting out of the house more now that the little girl has gotten her vaccinations, and it almost feels like we’re normal people again!&lt;/p&gt;

People believe that it’s out there helping or hurting them. They believe that it is a force to be reckoned with. With countless other things in the world people take to rationalism. They deny spirituality, mysticism, and definitely things like Christianity. But all around us people have ideas ingrained in their minds about luck. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;You dare not shave your &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.gtww.net/1iavCMf&quot;&gt;playoff beard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Saying “good luck” to someone before they go on stage for a performance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Don’t do anything to annoy or bother evil spirits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If you win a game doing a certain routine, don’t change that routine as long as you continue winning&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The list goes on and on. Superstitions, old wives’ tales, and folklore. By any of its names, luck abounds in all cultures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got to thinking about this because Chinese New Year happened a little while ago and brought &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.gtww.net/1m7d6bk&quot;&gt;red envelopes&lt;/a&gt; with it. It’s interesting to be a Christian and Chinese at this time of year. I shouldn’t believe in luck, and yet I still accept these gifts which are filled with ideas of luck and prosperity. (I’ve come to accept it as a gift but heartily do not believe that it wards off evil spirits or brings me good luck.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luck, and all of its spawn, are everywhere. It will take some effort to avoid allowing it to take hold in my life, that’s for sure!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>When Selfishness Surpasses Logic</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/when-selfishness-surpasses-logic/"/> <updated>2013-12-07T11:10:32-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/when-selfishness-surpasses-logic</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was out for lunch on a Sunday afternoon in Chinatown. The restaurant that my group went to was mostly full, but we were able to get a table in a back room. It wasn’t ideally placed since it was awkwardly positioned relative to another large table, but it was definitely better than having to wait. I sat near the large table with my back to it and at some point later on in the meal my lunch mates indicated for me to look behind me. Lo and behold there was an elderly Chinese woman sitting with her chair positioned so that I could not move back any further. This wouldn’t be a problem if that’s what the proximity of our tables required, but she was so far from her table that she couldn’t touch it if she wanted to. In fact I’m not sure if she could have touched the people who were sitting at the table! She had taken it upon herself to reserve as much space for her table as possible. Oh fantastic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we concluded and left our lunch, my group discussed this. What amazed us most was the fact that she would make herself so uncomfortable to do what she did. In the end, she was able to reserve some extra breathing room for her lunch mates even though she had put herself out of sorts. However, the extra breathing room is pretty useless if you already have plenty of breathing room! Ultimately I am losing, she is losing, and her tablemates are not really gaining anything of use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a small personal context this doesn’t make sense. Nor does it in a larger social sense. Getting cheap/free healthcare is going to cost all of the rest of the people more (whether reduced benefits or higher cost). For you to get more, others must get less. There is no magic fountain of money and benefits. Would you pursue more if ultimately getting more meant that everyone got nothing? What if everything collapsed because everyone was getting something for free? Was it worth it? Is your pension worth it if governments go bankrupt? Is it even worth anything at that point?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take what you’re doing and think about the consequences. You might not like what you find.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Surprising Things My Coworkers Never Learned</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/surprising-things-my-coworkers-never-learned/"/> <updated>2013-08-31T21:17:00-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/surprising-things-my-coworkers-never-learned</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a few years on the job, I have seen a number of things that I find rather peculiar. While I wouldn’t say that I meet people from all walks of life, I have met quite an assortment of people. I have realized that people are different from me. Some of them are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different from me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take these examples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cutting other people off while they’re talking. It seems that people need to get a word in edgewise, and they find that the best time is when someone else is talking.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Food service help. Some people are very helpful when it comes to preparing food for company events (e.g., BBQ, birthday cake). However, their grasp of cleanliness seems to be different from mine. They are very open to the idea of eating the food while preparing it. They are totally &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.gtww.net/14hQQik&quot;&gt;down&lt;/a&gt; with using their bare hands to touch food. Yum!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Covering their mouths when coughing and sneezing. No explanation really needed. Everyone should always cover up!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Washing their hands after using the bathroom. And some of the people that do wash their hands do not seem to understand that hand washing is even better when you use soap. The sign with “Lavese Las Manos Antes De Salir Esta Sala” should probably mention soap.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my life, where things can always be amusing. You just have to notice them.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Plywood Tree Coat Rack</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/plywood-tree-coat-rack/"/> <updated>2013-08-24T10:52:00-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/plywood-tree-coat-rack</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is a fun and very functional little add on that I recently did:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2013/08_Tree_Hooks/1397/tree-1_0df0f71.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Full Plywood Tree&quot; /&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;http://img.gtww.net/2013/08_Tree_Hooks/1397/tree-2_6688327.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hook Closeup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On top of all of that, it was super cheap to do (especially compared with just buying a premade set of hooks). The cost breakdown was something like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dowels - $5&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dowel Screws - $2.50&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Plywood scraps - already had&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Screw, nails - already had&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can see I mainly used scraps that I already had from other projects.

As with many people, I find that they’re a fun diversion from life. We can quickly escape into a world where the only goal is getting a particular roll of the die or win a particular competition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the beginning, we just try to understand the rules of the game. As we progress, though, we start to naturally get better at them. We figure out optimal ways to accomplish whatever task it is that we’re trying to do. That’s good, but sometimes we want to get there faster than through simple experience. This entails looking up tips and tricks. In previous times, we would have to read books or ask people to help with this. Nowadays there are all kinds of options for getting better at the games that we play. This can range anywhere from reading the daily newspaper for scenarios about &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.gtww.net/17hUTgu&quot;&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; to watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://go.gtww.net/13cKgyd&quot;&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt; for the World Poker Tour to checking out &lt;a href=&quot;http://ballsupbingo.com/&quot;&gt;ballsupbingo&lt;/a&gt; for bingo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However we get there, I am all in favor of more games! Exercise your mind, try something new, and make friends doing it.

How can you even begin to start all of that if people can’t even agree on the definition. Some people think that a date must involve mutual feelings. Others think that you have to use the word “date” for it to count. Semantics, people!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;noun - Prearranged meeting between a male and a female for some period of time greater than 10 minutes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;verb - Spending time socially with one other person of the opposite sex&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;People are going to object to my definitions. In fact people have already objected to my definitions! But stick to them, and your wariness might prove to save you untold heartache from a lack of communication. At the worst, these definitions are going to force you to communicate about what people’s intentions rather than drawing your own assumptions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And remember everyone, assumptions are a fast track to trouble.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Color Mob 5K Run</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/color-mob-5k-run/"/> <updated>2013-02-11T21:38:00-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/color-mob-5k-run</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A run that was more about the fun than about the run.

It’s been a few months now, but I mention it here to keep things on the up and up. Based on my pattern, I’m good for a few years until I yearn for new things. Then again, I have a relatively small sample size. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed my previous job. The work was fine, and I had some friends amongst my workers (note: Crom wasn’t one of them). But I’m off to new things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I now work for a retail website (in fashion no less). Suffice to say it’s been a bit of a different experience since now it’s less about the software and more about selling products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh don’t worry, I have some Crom posts backed up that I need to finish. So stay tuned for those, but fear not for I have already encountered numerous other characters in my new workplace! I suspect that this blog won’t ever die simply because I need an outlet to tell the stories that make up my life.

You were fantastic to me for over 5 years, but I’m moving on to something new. In efforts to keep things fresh, learn something new, and improve the performance of this blog, I am starting to blog with &lt;a href=&quot;http://octopress.org&quot;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt;, which is a blogging platform built on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The advantages of this system include (but are not limited to):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;It serves static web pages so it’s &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; offers built-in support so my blog is now in proper source control and hosted for free!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The completed website is generated on my machine and pushed to a webserver so I could easily move webhosts at any time.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of write-ups about transitioning to a Jekyll-powered blog. Namely I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp&quot;&gt;exitwp&lt;/a&gt; to extract the posts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Octopress includes a pretty decent stylesheet, which made it easy to get up and writing. However, I ended up customizing it that my blog would not look like all of the other Octopress-powered websites out there. Some of the things that I added were:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#sitemap&quot;&gt;Sitemap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#atom&quot;&gt;Atom Feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#sidebar_state&quot;&gt;Retaining sidebar collapsed state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-idsitemapasitemap&quot;&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;sitemap&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sitemap&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Octopress included a sitemap plugin, but I didn’t like that it used the file modification time. In theory that works great, but for some reason it always showed every post with the exact same modification time. So I just created my own:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/596/finishing-my-first-marathon/&quot;&gt;running a marathon&lt;/a&gt;.  It is often referenced in terms of doing something difficult with perseverance.  Yes it is true that it is difficult.  Yes it is true that you need some perseverance (some more so than others simply because they aren’t as ready).  &lt;em&gt;Talking about it&lt;/em&gt;, though, requires experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I was younger I chafed at the idea that I could not understand something simply because I had not done it yet.  When I was learning how to drive a car I doubted my parents when they told me that I needed experience.  They essentially claimed that they were better at driving simply because they had done it longer than I have.  I reasoned that I understood the laws better than they, and in fact I probably had better reactions than they did.  So it seemed fairly reasonable that I could drive as well (if not better than) they could.  My how I was young and foolish!  (On a side note I must remember that being foolish is very often associated with being young.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have learned that yes, experience does matter.  Nobody buys a book about trading stocks from an author who has never traded stocks.  Nor does one buy a cookbook by someone who could not boil water.  Neither do I want to hear someone extol the virtues of running a marathon if they have not actually run a marathon.  Do you want to talk about running a marathon?  Then &lt;strong&gt;run a marathon&lt;/strong&gt;!  It will give your words more weight.  Alternatively there are countless other examples that you could draw from to prove your point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experience does not linearly increases abilities, but I have come to appreciate that experience brings a measure of wisdom.  Oh that’s just great, next thing I know I am going to start calling kids “sonny” and talk about the “good ol’ days”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wing It&lt;/strong&gt; - This is especially important early on.  Everyone likes a man who can improvise.  It’s probably just better to ask her what she wants to do when you pick her up.  Since you know, she might be very particular about the food she eats, the activities that she does, and so on and so forth.  So don’t plan anything specific because it will just be a waste of your time.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Split The Bill&lt;/strong&gt; - This is the modern age.  Women are the equal of men.  And you know what that means!  She wants you to treat her like an equal.  Plus you know, it might not work out.  Either way you get to save more of your hard-earned money in the process.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have Her Drive&lt;/strong&gt; - She probably likes driving anyway.  This will let her practice since girls aren’t as good at driving.  Oh and you’re going to do whatever she wants anyway.  So really, everyone wins.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Talking As Much As Possible&lt;/strong&gt; - Just stare.  She’s beautiful, huh?  Talking isn’t necessary.  She’ll be won over by your style, charisma, and wonderful cologne.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk About Yourself&lt;/strong&gt; - When you do have to talk (e.g., she asks you a question) then just make sure to keep the topic of conversation on something that you know.  And what do you know better than yourself and your favorite things?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come On Strong&lt;/strong&gt; - Only the serious-minded know that the secret to winning the girl is to either go laid back cool or full-court press.  So if you are going to the latter route then you better go all of the way.  5 course candle-lit dinner, sunset walk on the beach, hired Mariachi band,  horse-drawn carriage.  Go big or go home, buddy.  Everything that you see in those romantic comedies is fair game.  Failing those things, &lt;em&gt;at the very least&lt;/em&gt; contact her early and often after the date.  Show her how much you want more.  She’ll reciprocate I’m sure.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Dodgeball</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/dodgeball/"/> <updated>2012-02-16T00:45:53-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/dodgeball</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dodgeball experienced a resurgence in popularity with the release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/MnBO66&quot;&gt;Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;From what I can recall, he talks to her at least twice a day.  Every.  Single.  Day.  The weird thing is that I get the impression that they also see each other quite often (I would guess 4 times a week).  Is that the weirdest thing?  No not by a long shot.  There are plenty of people out there who cannot get enough of seeing and talking to each other.  And I am sure that there are plenty of middle-aged men with girlfriends out there as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, the weirdest thing is the fact that when he talks to her it is sugar, honey, lovey, and dovey for a little while.  You know what I mean.  He has his boyfriend voice (ugh, I feel gross just typing that) and talks softly and gently while saying nice things.  However, for whatever reason this almost always turns on a dime, and he seems to get very irritated/impatient with her.  He will start to tell her the things that she needs to do (e.g., get out of bed and get ready for work) or he will quickly bail out on the conversation (e.g., I really need to get back to work).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know that no couple is perfect because &lt;strong&gt;nobody is perfect&lt;/strong&gt;.  So it is not that strange that they could have this conversation every so often.  However it does seem strange to me that it seems to happen every time that they talk.  And remember, they talk a couple of times a day everyday!  I have no idea what it is about these people!  I have so many questions.  Why does he do it?  Why does she put up with it?  Why are they still together after all of this time??&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps he is starting to feel guilty about using work time for personal reasons.  Perhaps he just gets tired of talking on the phone.  (Now mind  you he usually just stays out here in the cubicles while he is talking so everyone can hear his conversation.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, I guess that we’ll just have to chalk it up to another mystery of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/tag/crom/&quot;&gt;Crom&lt;/a&gt;.  I doubt that I could ever understand.&lt;/p&gt;

data-description=&quot;Here is the assembled harness.  I connect this to the grommet on the original camera strap and then I thread my shoulder strap through the nylon strap and the carabiner.  In actuality, I don&#39;t need both the nylon strap and the carabiner.  Originally I only had the nylon strap, but I found that it had too much friction with the shoulder strap.  So with both the nylon strap and the carabiner I get the benefit of less friction between the carabiner and the shoulder strap along with double safety in case either the nylon strap or the carabiner fails (neither of which seems likely to me).&quot;

&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoyed making this, especially when compared to the ~$60 R-Strap.  It saved me some money.  (Then again, that small amount of money saved hardly gets me very far in terms of purchasing new lenses!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My main issues with the commercial R-Strap is its price and its attachment to the tripod mount.  I don’t particularly trust screws to hold my camera, especially since it swings and hangs there.  Additionally, it is quite difficult to put a camera on a tripod with something else attached to its tripod mount!  This strap attaches to one of the metal tabs that is normally used for holding up the camera.  It’s integral to the camera body, and I trust that it won’t break.  If it does break, then it would drop just as it would have if I were only using the original Canon strap.  In any case it is a pretty secure setup, and I will be using this for the time being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of my inspiration is from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.comhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Safer-DIY-R-Strap/&quot;&gt;Safer DIY R-Strap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Crom, The One Who Is All Up In Your Business</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/crom-the-one-who-is-all-up-in-your-business/"/> <updated>2011-09-15T01:20:31-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/crom-the-one-who-is-all-up-in-your-business</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People want their private space.  People &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; their private space.  Some people have even been known to go crazy without it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there are people who do not seem to really understand the whole personal space thing.  My co-worker, Crom, is exactly one of those people.  I don’t know if I would go so far as to say that he enjoys getting all up in people’s business (and by business I mean personal space), but he definitely does it the majority of the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s even worse for the short ones!  He is pretty tall (over 6’) and has a bit of a portly stomach, which I would imagine would make shorter people feel like he is intruding into his space even more if his stomach is near their face!  Thankfully I am not at that height.  Interestingly enough &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/914/crom-the-one-with-the-girlfriend/&quot;&gt;his girlfriend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; pretty short at (I’m estimating) 5’2”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best part is getting to watch Crom do this to other people.  Unbeknownst to him, I observe him and amuse myself  with all of it.  What can you learn from all of this?  Beware of the watchful ones since they are probably analyzing and making fun of you in their head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something that I am continuing to learn is that friendships will change.  As in, you will change.  Or the friend(s) will change.  Or circumstances will change.  Maybe you just stopped trying.  Maybe they slighted you in some way.  All of this adds up to your friendship changing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So apparently I am much worse than I thought I would be at maintaining friendships.  People have come and gone in my life.  Some have left a mark (and amusingly many have not).  Many are now gone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now looking back on times long gone, I realize how difficult it would have been to predict how my life would have turned out.  Even if things had been planned or more effort would have been invested, I know that it would have been quite difficult to overcome what has turned out to be the biggest reason for all of the change: &lt;strong&gt;life&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems strange to me that the LAP-BAND will compare itself to diet and exercise by saying that diet and exercise do not work because people fail.  While I am sure that is true, that is not a particular reason why the LAP-BAND is better since that comparison is effectively saying that it is better for a person if they cannot choose to do something themselves.  On the other hand I think that people need to make that choice.  With freedom they have a responsibility to live with their choices.  I would not want another person telling me what I can and cannot do.  The most marked change is the one that comes from within when they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/476/having-the-desire/&quot;&gt;have the desire for change&lt;/a&gt;.  They need to want it so badly that they actually get out and do something to enact that change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The part that amazes me so much (and which is the impetus for this post) is that people who do end up getting medical help take pride in that.  How can you be proud that you resorted to get surgery to get skinnier??  Absurdity of absurdities!  Can you be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/229/proud-of-nothing/&quot;&gt;proud of things that you have no control over&lt;/a&gt;?  Well…apparently people are.  Still, the fact that people are will always boggle my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that people are confused about developers, especially those that create free software.  Maybe they do not think that the developers are entitled to compensation because they are releasing free software.  I guess that in part it is due to the difference between the definitions of free (as in zero cost) and free (as in liberty).  Software developers are (surprise!) real people that need to make a living as well.  In a world that contains both free (as in zero cost) and free (as in liberty) software, people need to understand both in order for them to see where the software developer is coming from.  So perhaps we can all remember that paying for software should be seen just like we should view all other purchases - if it satisfies our requirements for purchasing then we should go ahead and do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these words when this abbreviated comic (originally &lt;a href=&quot;http://theoatmeal.com/blog/apps&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) says it perhaps even better:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/theoatmeal-img/comics/apps/3.png&quot;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/179/applegeeks-coachgirls/&quot;&gt;Apple stickers&lt;/a&gt; on cars, Gucci emblems on purses (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/70/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/&quot;&gt;real or fake&lt;/a&gt;), and perhaps even soccer jerseys with their large corporate sponsorship logos are all things that seem to follow this idea.  It’s a strange idea really because we are paying companies so that we can advertise for them.  If I walked up to you and asked if you would pay me money in order to wear a necklace with my name on it you would think that I am crazy.  Is the idea that we would pay to display companies’ logos that far off from this example?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nowadays people have a choice.  And I am always surprised when people choose self-branding.  Instead of viewing it as branding, though, they want to display an affiliation, love the cachet/exclusivity, or perhaps just do it because others do it also.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In truth, we all do it to some degree.  We buy T-shirts, computers, and cars that all have logos on them.  So I would doubt very much if anyone is exempt.  But thinking about it sure does make one think.  And it sure does give me a different perspective of “brand” names.&lt;/p&gt;

When used in terms of software, it usually refers to having someone overseas in India or China write the code according to what the desired behavior is. For the past decade or so there has been talk (and more than talk) about how all of the software created is going to be outsourced rather than done in America.  In fact I remember during my undergraduate studies there was a survey taken of my class to find out whether talk of the outsourcing of our future careers scared us into going into other fields.  At the time it did not seem too pressing of an issue.  Maybe it is because we were not aware enough of what was really going on in the industry yet.  In any case, the reason that all of the outsourcing was talked about is basically because American computer programmers are much more expensive than those in other countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what does this mean to me (or you) unless you are getting laid off as your work is being moved overseas?  I think it still is quite relevant.  Because it is not just losing a job that causes me to stop.  It is really the fact that I have seen people purposely choose to outsource their own projects!  In their new ventures they have opted to outsource the programming to some other group or country. As for me, though, I do not think that I would ever outsource my projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reasons why I would not outsource my projects:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I set out on a side project because &lt;strong&gt;I want to learn&lt;/strong&gt; something. Maybe I want to learn a new programming language. Maybe I just want to go through the experience of building something in particular. After all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/366/experience-matters/&quot;&gt;experience matters&lt;/a&gt;.  And I want that experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Outsourcing something essentially &lt;strong&gt;tramples upon the lower state of others&lt;/strong&gt;.  While I am sure that I do this in an indirect way (e.g., by buying anything made in China), it still seems worse to me to directly order other people to do things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I do something myself, I get this odd &lt;strong&gt;satisfaction from doing something myself&lt;/strong&gt;.  I do not imagine that everyone else feels the same way.  In fact I would guess that most other people just want whatever it is to work.  But I love being able to look at something (even if it is imperfect) and knowing that I had a huge hand in doing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;There seem to be a myriad of reasons why working with people in another country (or even other people in general) would be difficult.  This includes things like &lt;strong&gt;language, time difference, and general misunderstandings&lt;/strong&gt;.  As the sayings goes: “If you want something done right you have got to do it yourself.”  Because trusting others to do things that you want to do is not ever going to work out just as you have planned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;While people can (obviously) do whatever they want with their projects, I am pretty sure that I would not do such a thing.  In fact it flies in the face of who I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure that you have a good reason for doing what you do.  The world has probably beaten and berated you.  You deserve some of this sweet nectar.  Besides, you figure that it is a chain restaurant, and the syrup water that you are taking is really only worth cents to them.  If you have a job it probably is not the one that you really want (I mean not everyone gets to sleep in, tell people what to do, and have no pressure on them whatsoever).  Or maybe you don’t get paid as much as you know that you deserve (it must be because people don’t understand how much you are worth).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people will never learn to have integrity &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/6/cheaters-4-life/&quot;&gt;no matter what they are doing&lt;/a&gt;.  Some people will sell it for a little cup of soda.  Then again &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2025:29-34&amp;amp;version=NASB&quot;&gt;others have sold much more valuable things for not much more in return&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So keep at it, sir.  I know that you will no matter what I say.  And good luck on that whole job of your dreams thing.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Crom, The One With The Girlfriend</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/crom-the-one-with-the-girlfriend/"/> <updated>2011-03-23T01:22:38-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/crom-the-one-with-the-girlfriend</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The post title pretty much says it.  Crom, our (or at least my) favorite interesting co-worker, has a girlfriend.  While this may be new to you, it is not actually new information.  As far as I can gather they are in a long term relationship.  So that would probably make it pretty old information since my co-workers tell me that she’s been in his life for awhile, and he has been here for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I wonder, what is it about commitment that scares people?  He is probably in his mid to late 40’s, and from the sound of it has never been married while he has worked here.  I have heard him joke about getting married to his girlfriend.  Of course I would imagine that those jokes have happened many times over the years with no obvious change in the situation.  Maybe he’s just testing things out like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/825/crom-the-one-without-license-plates/&quot;&gt;he’s testing out his “new” car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wonder if he writes a blog, and he wonders about me being a young (relatively to him) guy who has already gotten suckered into getting married.  Let’s hope so!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The funniest part is that I could never forget her name.  Previously he gave some of us login information for one of his machines so that we could work on a project.  Her name was the password.  Even though I have long since worked on that project, I definitely keep that Post-It note around just for kicks.&lt;/p&gt;

I had no idea that I cared so much until he started his new job recently. Now I have had coworkers who smoked in the past, but they were never close enough in proximity to make a huge difference to me. That is I could smell the stench when I got close to them, but I did not need to be close to them to do my work on a regular basis. However this new coworker is in the cubicle right next to me so suffice to say he is very close to where I need to be to do my work on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyday I find myself trying to figure out his smoking break schedule so that I can tell when I want to take a nice stroll around to see what everyone else is up to. I find myself trying to cover my nose (even though I know that the third-hand smoke can easily get through whatever it is that I’m using to cover it). Somehow, whether real or imagined into being, I find that sometimes I will feel slightly ill right around the time that he comes back from his smoke break.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The coworker does not help the situation very much because he is hardly friendly. He pretty much keeps to himself even when everyone else is chatting. He seems content to be in his world, and subsequently I do not really have a relationship with him. He does not seem stupid so I am pretty sure that he is aware of all of the warnings about the detrimental effects of smoking. At least he knows that he has to go outside to smoke. In any case, I have been thinking about what I can do about this little problem. Some ideas that I have had:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Post a sign about smoking (which might get me onto &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.passiveaggressivenotes.com/&quot;&gt;Passive Aggressive Notes&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Move all of his stuff to another cubicle far away and print out a paper directing him to his new location as a result of some hazard located only in his cubicle with thanks and regrets from “The Management”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complain loudly to everyone except to him. If he asks me about it then just deny, deny, deny&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get a fan (its size depending on how passive aggressive I’m feeling) and turn it on whenever he comes back from a smoke break&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complain to human resources that I am in an unsuitable environment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as he gets back from his smoke breaks loudly take my laptop and stomp over to another cubicle or office to start working there&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or I just realized that I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; just you know…talk to him and tell him how I feel.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>2011 Los Angeles 13.1 Race Report</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2011-los-angeles-13-1-race-report/"/> <updated>2011-01-16T14:37:32-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/2011-los-angeles-13-1-race-report</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Running has just become a part of my life. I hear others talk about how they think that it’s sheer craziness, and I know that I would have agreed at times in my life with that sentiment. But since my mind was changed around 7 years ago I have gone from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/389/half-marathon/&quot;&gt;my first half&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/596/finishing-my-first-marathon/&quot;&gt;a full&lt;/a&gt; and even starting to mix in a fair share of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/631/barefoot-running/&quot;&gt;barefoot running&lt;/a&gt;. With this in mind I decided to do another half marathon with some friends from church.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This half marathon stands apart from the other races that I did because I believe that I did nearly all of my training for it barefoot. There might have been a couple of runs that I ran shod, but I don’t particularly remember them even when I ran in Boston, MA in November or during the cold temperatures here in Los Angeles, CA (~36 degrees Fahrenheit at night). In any case I was fairly set on trying to do this barefoot, but I hurt my heel on my very last tapered run 2 days before the race! I was trying to run on the street more since it was going to be a street race, but it did not go well. I am sure that there are errors in my form, and these will need to be addressed in the future. This started to give me some idea to what my problems were going to be for the race. The pain in my heel was slight, but I knew from past experience that any slight pain will be hugely magnified over the course of many miles. This made me start to doubt whether I would be able to finish the race barefoot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The morning of the race went well. We all slept well and got up ready to go. I brought my shoes along just in case the conditions were unbearable, but I decided to leave them in the car when we finally got there. At the starting line I went up to the 8-9 minute/mile corral just before they started the race. The first mile along the boardwalk was grand since it was concrete, and I have plenty of concrete sidewalk experience. However near the first mile marker the course turned onto Venice Blvd. That first portion went decently even if there were some rough spots. Just to give you an idea from &lt;a href=&quot;http://therunningbarefoot.com/?p=625s&quot;&gt;Ken Bob’s Terrain Guide&lt;/a&gt;, I had trained mostly on grades near 6 or 7 while the actual surface of those Santa Monica streets oftentimes warranted a 3 or 4.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case I continued on my merry way, doing okay until between miles 8 and 9. It was at that point that I was starting to feel the pain quite a bit, and it was affecting me a lot. I refused to stop or walk, but I was not doing well. Instead of passing people, I was starting to get passed. I won’t lie, it was rough going. The surface seemed to have gotten worse on the way back, but it could have just been that I was more sensitive after having run all of those other miles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those last 5 miles were torturous. I knew that I had to make it, and I knew that I could not stop. I reasoned with myself that stopping to walk just meant more time on my feet, and that was the last thing that I wanted at that point. I approached the end, thankfully, and I’m pretty sure that I picked it up in the last half of a mile as the finish line neared simply based on the fact that I was soon going to be able to get off of my feet. For the next 2 hours I was either sitting with my feet off of the pavement or hobbling uncomfortably because my feet were too tender to walk very far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did get to meet a nice older fellow who had run the race barefoot. He looked pretty comfortable as he was walking around afterward, but we chatted and he shook my hand in congratulating me on my first barefoot half marathon. I’m pretty sure that he thought that I was slightly foolish for only having run my longest barefoot run at ~10 miles prior to that race, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t have too many pictures because honestly I only had 2 things on my mind. My right and my left feet. But the short story is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I did not train far enough in my distances.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I did not train on the correct surfaces.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I will be hobbling for a little while.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://results.active.com/pages/oneResult.jsp?pID=98847911&amp;amp;rsID=105097&amp;amp;pubID=3&quot;&gt;I did it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Everyone Needs A Soundtrack</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/everyone-needs-a-soundtrack/"/> <updated>2010-12-30T00:15:56-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/everyone-needs-a-soundtrack</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Books are great. They take us to far away lands and on many adventures. They stimulate the mind and imagination to explore things that have been or things that could be. But alas they are a dying form of entertainment it seems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even with the advent of the digital book reader (such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/Nxod9r&quot;&gt;Amazon Kindle&lt;/a&gt;), many people are moving towards more quickly gratifying forms of entertainment. We want games immediately on our iPhone (even if it gives us &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/710/iphone-attention-deficit/&quot;&gt;ADD&lt;/a&gt;), we don’t want to waste a moment of possible entertainment so we watch videos in our cars, and we maintain the convenient connection with people through Facebook and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/83/tweedle-dee-twitter-dumb/&quot;&gt;Twittter&lt;/a&gt; rather than actually interacting with them face-to-face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it seems that lately people are progressing even further. Many people cannot even walk around without rocking some tunes. They do this when they’re by themselves, with their family, or even with their friends! While this seems to be more prevalent with teenagers, I have seen it with others as well. Is it the incessant need to be entertained? Is it the desire to shut out the world to live in one’s own fantasy? I daresay that while these might be true, it is actually because everyone simply wants to be the hero!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Movies always have a soundtrack, and it is especially apparent during the monumental scenes. What kind of a movie would it be if there was not music playing as the hero rescues the captive while avoiding 2 dragons, 10 soldiers, and a huge boulder?! The music helps the audience experience the emotion and excitement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So kids these days. They should be commended. They just want to be the hero and do good in the world. Or maybe they just need a jolt of extra emotion in their lives, which is probably good because many accuse them of a lack of passion. In any case, maybe we should all just give a kid with headphones on a high five.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unless, of course, they’re playing the villain’s track.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Bag Of Crap</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/bag-of-crap/"/> <updated>2010-12-21T00:37:58-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/bag-of-crap</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Check out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woot#Bag_of_Crap&quot;&gt;bandolier of carrots&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5169/5279014335_33ce24c054_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5169/5279014335_33ce24c054_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Crispy Is Great</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/crispy-is-great/"/> <updated>2010-12-06T00:42:49-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/crispy-is-great</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Crispy. Yeah that’s something that I can work with. I have started to enjoy photographing food. Possibly because I enjoy food, and I want to in some way remember the experience of good food. So while I will not ever be able to share the taste and smells of the food, I can at least share the visuals.

That is not surprising. But it is surprising when Crom is loud in the bathroom because I am of a particular opinion that most people try to be discrete there. And he can do this no matter what he is doing in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He will walk in loudly as if he is in a rush. He whistles and hums.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As he is urinating it is as if he is using all of his might to expel the liquid from his system. Oddly enough, it seems as if there is air in the line since it will go full force then halt entirely then back to full force. Even more odd is the fact that I have always thought that going full force (as he does) would result in more splash-back (if you know what I mean). After expelling the liquid, he seems to like to let out a loud sigh of relief. The sound makes me think that he is being intimate with the urinal. That is just the sound that I want to be hearing from him. Ew. Just ew. After that I sometimes &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unfortunately do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; hear the sound of the faucet. Quadruple ew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now on the other hand, there are times when he poops. I mean, &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/Rs69nc&quot;&gt;everyone does&lt;/a&gt;. And those times are pretty loud as well. But that’s because he pushes that stuff out of his butt with as much force as he can. At least that’s what it seems like! I can also discern that there is no toilet seat cover or toilet paper used to cover the seat. Good thing he washes his hands after using the stall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the bathroom world of Crom. It is a very unpleasant place for the rest of us. He probably does not know about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/176/on-bathroom-behavior/&quot;&gt;some of my opinions about the bathroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Experience Required</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/experience-required/"/> <updated>2010-10-16T01:15:03-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/experience-required</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You might be surprised to know that I actually know that I do not know everything. People who personally interact with me sure are. Even more likely, they flat out refuse to believe it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I am confident that I am not delusional. I know that I do not know everything. So yes, I am confident when I think that I know something (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/5/algorithm-for-your-life/&quot;&gt;as most people are&lt;/a&gt;), but I also have seen enough to know that there is a vast amount of things that I have no idea about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I was learning how to drive, I did not give too much credit to my parents when they told me that experience matters in determining how good of a driver I was. I thought that as long as I knew and followed the correct procedures, I would be just fine. But I was wrong. Surprise, surprise; experience really does matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having the chance to actually see and try things for yourself is priceless. There is absolutely no substitute for experience. It gives you a warranted confidence that you know and can handle whatever it is that you are doing again. Experience involves getting up close and personal with tasks. You get to see (and hopefully get through) hiccups. You get to see the whole process through to the end and learn lessons from first-hand knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when someone is giving me &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/781/unsolicited-advice/&quot;&gt;unsolicited advice&lt;/a&gt; about a project or task, my immediate response is needing to know whether they have actually done it themselves. I do not want to know if they understand what to do, have seen it done by someone else, or have read manuals about it. I want to know if that adviser has actually done it. If so, they have some credibility in my mind. If not, their words might as well be “Wah wah wah.”&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Being Thankful For Monetary Gifts</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/being-thankful-for-monetary-gifts/"/> <updated>2010-09-17T01:18:22-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/being-thankful-for-monetary-gifts</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Growing up (maybe just because it was growing up in the United States of America), I have become accustomed to getting gifts. There are presents for birthdays, graduations, Christmas, and other events that society deems worthy. There are all kinds of gifts, too. There are handmade gifts, clothes, toys, service coupons (e.g., breakfast in bed), simple cards, gift cards, and even the classic dollar bill(s).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a child I used to enjoy getting money as much (and probably more than) any other type of gift. It is of the utmost in practicality since it can be used for anything that the receiver desires. It is also much easier on the giver since it removes all of the effort involved in finding and purchasing a gift.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I think, as a receiver of gifts, therein lies the reason why my embrace of money has declined as I have aged. There is no work on the part of the giver. Actually I should take that back because they do have to work at a job in order to actually receive that money. But a giver of money does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; need to wonder about the recipient’s desires or tastes. They do not need to go out searching for an appropriate gift that will delight. I appreciate the work that is involved in all of that. (Even if, sometimes, the gift turns out to be awful. If that is the case, I indeed would probably prefer money, but I can still try to appreciate the work and attempt that the giver made.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which leads me to my method of dealing with monetary gifts. I can happily receive such a gift, but I also try my best to set aside that money and use it on something pleasant. In that way, I can tangibly interact with the gift that has been given to me. I find that it makes me much more thankful to have, say, a room fan rather than $50 in my pocket that will be spent over time on miscellaneous soon-forgotten expenses (e.g., parking meter). The fan can cool me on a summer night. The $50? Not nearly as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, can it really hurt any of us to be more thankful people?&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Acronyms</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/acronyms/"/> <updated>2010-09-01T01:29:50-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/acronyms</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is it just me or does it seem like there are a lot more acronyms around? There are institutions for this, organizations for that, degrees in something else, and (especially) the forms and titles for all types of occupations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Acronyms are not inherently awful things. In fact they are quite convenient. They allow us to say “PC” instead of “personal computer” or “CEO” instead of “Chief Executive Officer.” They only become a problem, though, when people use more obscure acronyms as if everyone should know them. It seems to me that people assume too much. Perhaps people never learned that it is bad practice to use an acronym (when you are writing) without spelling it out first. There are acceptable exceptions to the rule when words are integrated into the language (e.g., radar). Still, it only seems blog-worthy because their use of acronyms points to a world in which everyone knows everything that is going on in your life. In fact, it seems likely to me that your audience has no idea what you are talking about unless they are as intimate with your topic of conversation as you are. So explain all of your acronyms usage appropriately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Really I suppose it is just a matter of society’s change in communication. It is likely that the assumption of audience understanding is indicative of a decrease in the collective communication skills of society. There is someone’s thesis topic.

It is a website that advocates a smaller government by exposing the ways that the government is improperly doing things. It is definitely enlightening because the articles attempt to show the readers ways that our very own federal government (of the United States of America) are doing things that most of us would very likely disapprove of. And boy do we! (Or at least…I do.) Compounding the problem is that many of these things do not even seem legal in light of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/512/10th-amendment/&quot;&gt;10th amendment&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn’t a long post and really I am not adding anything to the collective knowledge or opinion of the Internet. However I have been enjoying some of the videos that I have seen there and would therefore like to share:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Getting Paid Under The Table</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/getting-paid-under-the-table/"/> <updated>2010-08-05T01:53:23-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/getting-paid-under-the-table</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately I feel like I have been encountering people who are getting paid under the table, which means that they are being paid in a way that attempts to circumvent tax laws. Basically whoever is paying them is not reporting that payment as wages and that means that they are not liable for their share of the tax to the government. The person being paid has the benefit of also not being subject to tax for that payment amount, which effectively means that everyone is keeping more money for themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there is a loser in this transaction. And that loser is everyone else. Everyone who &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; pay their taxes loses because:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;they could be paying less&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;they could receive more benefits if everyone paid their taxes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the national debt (which at the time of writing stands at over $13 trillion - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/&quot;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;) could be lower&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead it is left to the taxpayers to pick up their slack. Yes, even though they (the ones involved in this nefarious transaction) are likely working members of society who do not see themselves as being a burden (they are making their own money after all), their presence on the roads, need for protection (e.g., police, fire), and receipt of other benefits are proof that they have an impact on us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Integrity? Yeah why don’t we go for that. Or at the absolute very least, acknowledge and label black as black and white as white.

The familiar sound can be heard at my workplace. Imagine the surprise of myself and my coworkers as we were chatting when we heard it. The sound is rather unmistakable and usually reserved for the bathroom in one’s home. However, we were actually at work on a weekday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It came as little surprise to us that Crom would do this. He is a man of little social reservation. He is the first to (eagerly) get his food. He is the first to go back to work so that he can leave earlier (without helping to clean up of course). He talks (sometimes loudly I might add) on the phone with his girlfriend (as I understand it, it’s a long term kind of thing). Truthfully, I would not be awfully surprised if he picks his nose and eats whatever treasure he finds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you hear your co-worker cutting his toenails at work, all bets are off.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Noticing Wedding Gifts</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/noticing-wedding-gifts/"/> <updated>2010-07-21T01:43:14-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/noticing-wedding-gifts</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I often figure that when I am in a large crowd, I will be much less noticed than when I am alone. This often turns out to be true, and I often enjoy blending in with the crowd. It provides a measure of anonymity that is sometimes desirable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weddings can be small or large affairs where each individual guest is merely a single person in a larger group. So it can stand to reason that each guest will think that they do not stand out too much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While we (my wife and I) made a conscious effort to be thankful for everything that was given to us, I have an insider’s tip for everyone that has not gone through a wedding yet: the bride and groom notice a lot more than you think. That means that your thoughtful, generous, cheap, or even missing gifts are noticed. This directly correlates with how close to the married couple you are. Do not be fooled into thinking that of 10’s, 100’s, or even 1000’s of gifts yours will not be noticed. While the day of the wedding might be a blur, the aftermath of finding out what people decided to gift you with is a much longer process that allows for more consideration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The purpose of weddings is &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; not gifts, but I figured that this tip might be useful to a lot of people who had not discovered it for themselves already. Either that, or we are the only ones, and we might have noticed you (for good or for bad). Remember that sometimes it’s the thought that counts and sometimes the thought only gets you so much. And then you have to at least give a well thought out card!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Crom, The One Without License Plates</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/crom-the-one-without-license-plates/"/> <updated>2010-07-13T01:32:25-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/crom-the-one-without-license-plates</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Crom bought a new hybrid vehicle approximately 1 year ago. When he bought it I could not help but overhear him proclaiming its merits. He talked about how it had all of the latest gadgets, of which I believe the only one that I actually heard him specifically mention was the Bluetooth. The same song came out of his mouth for the whole week. Not a big deal. Everyone gets excited when we get a new possession, right? Lately I doubt that he has been as excited about it. It’s a Toyota after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a year of owning the car, he still does not have license plates on it. It appears to those who do not know that it is a new car. When I noticed that this was happening (it’s hard not to notice after a few months) I was very curious as to why someone would want to do this. My pondering led me to the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;The license plates that he received were 6BAD666, 1SAD120, etc or which he otherwise found offensive.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;He is in love with the dealer that sold him his vehicle&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Now he has the ability to run red lights or drive toll roads without paying&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;He desires to remain as unique as possible (i.e., a recently purchased Toyota)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;He actually purchases a new model of the same car every couple of months&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The Department of Motor Vehicles has made its first ever mistake&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am of a mind to tear his precious new car papers just to see what happens.

Some of them are very amusing and some of them are difficult to understand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have decided that my own thoughts (while arguably interesting and intriguing) are not the only thing that I want on this blog. I want to season the meat and potatoes of this blog’s content with some posts about my everyday life. You will be able to judge the amusement factor of these posts for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to Crom. He sits in a nearby cubicle and has been working in this office for over a decade. That makes his tenure longer than the newer people (like myself) but definitely not as long as the old timers (of which there are a whole lot, some of whom have been around for a couple of decades!). He works rather autonomously on single-main projects. I suspect that he and I do not share the same sense of humor. We also do not share the same idea of manners but more on that later.

Conversely it is awful when it refers to the appropriations of government money for local projects. While I might be a big supporter of the former, let’s not forget that the late Senator Robert Byrd was a huge proponent of the latter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he passed, I heard a radio commentator quote an unnamed source from West Virginia saying that they would not know what to do now that he wasn’t in Washington to send federal funds back to them. It makes sense for them to think this way because he sent back billions to them during his tenure (Citizens Against Government Waste has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cagw.org/newsroom/byrd-pork-tally.html&quot;&gt;tally of Senator Byrd’s pork&lt;/a&gt; that will boggle the mind). So it is true, they just lost a major source of income. What’s a person to do?! I have an idea: start making your own way instead of swiping money from the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am sure that the people of West Virginia are not the only ones. There are recipients of pork everywhere, and they should all be ashamed. This corruption needs to stop. We all know that politicians are self-serving, power-hungry individuals. Do not feed them your vote &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; willingly eat their pork! Does anyone think about the fact that the politicians are taking money from everyone else just so that they can remain in office?

It seems to me that oftentimes the advice giver is simply someone who is older who feels like they must direct the uninitiated, and to me &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/244/age-its-just-a-number/&quot;&gt;age is just a number&lt;/a&gt; that does not automatically entitle people to give advice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know that mistakes are not pleasant. Sometimes mistakes hurt. They might even hurt a lot. But just because something is unpleasant or hurtful does not necessarily make me want to avoid it. While I do not relish pain, I do appreciate lessons learned. No lesson is as well learned as one through a mistake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I go through life I have grown to appreciate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/428/pay-me-in-silence/&quot;&gt;silence from others&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a good thing to fall off the bike and get up to try again. The problem is that people that have fallen off of the bike before do not want others to fall off, too. They want them to go straight to riding perfectly. Or maybe they want to ban bikes altogether.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I like trying things out, I can definitively say that I do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; know much in this life. I know some things. I will learn other things. And hopefully there will always be people around me that I can turn to for some advice. The thing is, I only want advice if I ask. And likewise I will only try to give advice if asked for it.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Modern Human Rights</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/modern-human-rights/"/> <updated>2010-04-23T01:27:23-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/modern-human-rights</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I think of basic rights, there are certain things that come to mind. There is life, which is the right to not be killed without a just reason. There is liberty, which allows us to have the freedom to do whatever we want to. And there is the pursuit of happiness, which allows us the freedom to find the ever elusive happiness (granted of course that this doesn’t interfere with others’ rights).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this day and age apparently people’s perceptions of human rights are changing. We are entitled to a good job (even if we do not deserve or cannot do the work), keeping our house (even when we cannot afford it), health care (even though it’s an optional service since our right to life is not an entitlement to a set number of years), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/10/broadband-access-a-legal-right-in-finland.html&quot;&gt;high speed internet&lt;/a&gt;. So while all of these things really deserve their own respective thoughts, I just have to say this: really, high speed internet? What an entitled and distorted society we live in.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Important vs Urgent</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/important-vs-urgent/"/> <updated>2010-03-31T01:25:39-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/important-vs-urgent</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We make decisions everyday. Some conjecture that we make hundreds of them. But really who knows because who really has the desire to count every single thing that we consciously decide upon. There are little choices like how many squares of toilet paper to use and there are big ones like what university to attend. Besides being categorized as big or small, we can also characterize its importance and its urgency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On initial glance, it would not seem that importance and urgency are as diametrically opposed as big and small. However in daily living, decisions that are strong in one aspect seem to butt up against other decisions that are strong in the other aspect. The question that we should (but do not often enough) ask of ourselves is whether we are making choices that we are comfortable with. It is easy to answer choices on paper, but actual actions indicate our actual choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I doubt that there are many of us who would say that answering a phone call about work is more important than continuing a discussion with a friend. Nor would anyone say that clean dishes are more important than spending quality time with a child. But when we step back and evaluate it, it sure does seem like we make some decisions that we regret, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe it is time to let the house get a little bit dirty, let voicemail fulfill its intended purpose, be cured of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/710/iphone-attention-deficit/&quot;&gt;iPhone ADD&lt;/a&gt;, and put work away. Then it just might be easier to look back and be comfortable with what we have decided to do with our lives.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Take It Easy, Old Fella</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/take-it-easy-old-fella/"/> <updated>2010-03-26T01:15:03-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/take-it-easy-old-fella</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the weather warms up, I start to see more people out and about getting their exercise on. That is, they’re either getting out of the stuffy gym for some sunshine or they are actually realizing that it is nice to be outside instead of sitting on the couch. Whatever their reason, it is good to see them out there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unless of course they are old.&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that is probably an ageist statement no matter how you slice it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, my whole point is that an old person should not be running in 85° F heat with either a plastic suit or a sweatshirt/sweatpants on. There are some things that are good and important (like exercise). There is also a fair amount of wisdom in knowing when to take it 100% and when to err on the safe side. A young guy trying to sweat out some water to make weight for high school wrestling can take the plastic suit a little better than an older gentleman in his 60s who is just trying to slim down for the ladies at the retirement home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So remember, friends don’t let friends let their grandparents go on a crash diet to get ready for cage fighting. What, cage fighting? Yeah that definitely seems like the only reasonable place for anyone over the age of 22 (i.e., post-collegiate wrestling) to wear a plastic suit.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Water War (Card Game)</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/water-war-card-game/"/> <updated>2010-02-15T00:20:01-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/water-war-card-game</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29&quot;&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;, here is a fun little game that was concocted by yours truly. In keeping with finding out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/773/the-origin-of-things/&quot;&gt;origin of things&lt;/a&gt;, this took place at the winter retreat of the Hi Koi fellowship in December 2007. Anyways, the game adds the mindlessness of war with punishments and randomness that will amuse you to no end. It is good clean fun! And it happens to be good for you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;At least 1 deck of cards&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;2+ players&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 cup for each player&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gameplay&lt;/strong&gt; Deal all of the cards to each player (as in war). Players are not to look at their cards. Play occurs in rounds (“battles”) with each player revealing the top card in their pile. The highest card (ace is high) is the winner. All players with cards lower than the highest relinquish their card to the player with the highest card as well as drink an arbitrarily small amount of water (i.e., a sip). If the 2 players have equally high cards, they are now to engage in a “war” with each player placing their top 3 cards facedown and revealing the 4th card. This continues until one of the players engaged in the “war” has a higher card. The loser of the war must relinquish all cards as well as drink the rest of the water in their cup. Once a player has lost all of their cards, they are eliminated. Each loser must drink the number of cups of water relative to their standing (i.e., the first person eliminated with 6 players has a standing of 6th and will then drink 6 cups of water).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate Versions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Winner must drink the water&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use food instead of water&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>The Perfect One</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-perfect-one/"/> <updated>2010-01-27T00:14:22-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-perfect-one</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Search for anything of substance, and you will find that it is quite easy to start believing that there is only one option that will satisfy. And even though it is near impossible to tell whether you have exhausted all possibilities in the world, you know that you will immediately recognize that Perfect One.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Perfect One is the ideal that you have in your mind of whatever it is that you are looking for. It is going to be recognized and apparent. You are sure of this. Far be it from me to doubt that you could possibly know this for sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example when you are dating, you are looking for the Perfect Boyfriend/Girlfriend. If you are a little better at seeing the bigger picture, you are looking for the Perfect Husband/Wife. But through the good and bad dates, you are evaluating the other person by holding them up against your ideal. Once the other person does not match, you are going to move on. Don’t pay attention to the fact that the person would make a very good match for you despite being slightly too short. Much more tragically than missing a good match in search of a perfect match, though, is being married to someone who you eventually believe to not be the perfect match. When that happens, you might find that you have found the Perfect One in another person. At the very least in this situation you are going to imagine the possibilities of a different life, and at the worst it can lead you to pursue your fantasies. This will obviously hurt many people around in addition to making you a liar (since you could not keep your vows).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another instance when people look for the Perfect One is when they are house hunting. When you are searching for a house, people often advise you that you will “just know” once you walk into a house. That is rubbish. It is just another way of saying that you should be looking for the Perfect House. Forget the fact that you are looking at houses that would work out just fine. And forget the fact that any house will have its problems. Forget the fact that &lt;strong&gt;it’s just a building&lt;/strong&gt; that will not last!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The horrible thing about this mindset is not that you should have standards. When someone fails to meet your standards for a mate or if a house is completely broken, you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; move on. That just makes sense. However, the horrible thing about this mindset is that it will fool you into doing things that do not make any sense at all. You will fall in love with the Perfect One with your heart but not with your head. And then when (not if) reality comes in the form of imperfections, you will be horribly disappointed. And it will hurt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can this be fixed? Yes it can! Today you can realize that there is no perfect one, whatever it is that you are looking for. Realize that settling can be just a negative take on this and realize that settling is not always so bad. Settle on something that is acceptable (this seems obvious but don’t settle on something that is unacceptable). If you do not settle, then at least start to believe that the Perfect One will never be found. Move forward with the knowledge that you will NOT find the Perfect One. And if the results match up to your expectations, you are much less likely to get into trouble.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>The Origin Of Things</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-origin-of-things/"/> <updated>2010-01-14T00:14:48-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-origin-of-things</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Given enough time, we rather forget about the origin of things. That reminds me of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-reading/the-foundation-trilogy-by-isaac-asimov/&quot;&gt;Isaac Asimov’s Foundation Trilogy&lt;/a&gt; where the novels are set thousands of years in the future, and the things that we know about now have by then become so far removed so as to be thought myth. They could not fathom the planet that we live on, and they could barely remember that they had originated from Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even when we are not so far removed from the origin of things we begin to see disagreements about the facts. As time moves on, opinions diverge. Sometimes no opinion even leads to the truth. Sometimes people become &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/10/fanaticism/&quot;&gt;fanatical&lt;/a&gt; about their opinions. In any case, we can see this phenomenon here and now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Give a new idea a couple of years, and it will be as if they had always existed. Nicknames just need time before they become the preferred way of referencing things (case in point: not too many people could tell you that “blog” is actually just a chopped up version of “web log”). Games are invented and taught to others with no regards as to why certain things are the way that they are. It is amazing, really, to think of how much information we pass on without even stopping to think about where that information comes from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; important aspect would be the origin of information. I know that I want to know if I can trust the source of information before I willingly pass it on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh by the way, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_on_Me_%28song%29&quot;&gt;Lean On Me&lt;/a&gt; is a song by Bill Withers.

And when you’re a young child, it is easy to trick yourself into believing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then you get older and you realize the truth. Words are, in fact, more powerful than physical pain. Physical pain definitely has its place. Broken bones, strained joints, diseases, and so on are all painful and uncomfortable (to say the least) to go through. But all of that pales in comparison to the effect that words and emotional trauma can have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While it’s rather debatable what can hurt a person more, it is pretty easy to see how emotional trauma can scar people for life. The life of a child who has verbally abusive parents can be negatively impacted for good even with counseling. While I do not want to undermine the damage that physical pain can have, the emotional pain is the one that I have seen with my own eyes because it happens all of the time. One can toil for great lengths of time over something, and sometimes it seems like it takes only a single word to make all of that labor futile. Words get at us even through our armor and shields. They needle their way through kinks and prick us to death. And the worst part of all is that it is the words of those closest to us that hurt the most. Well maybe even worse than that is the fact that we are all so horrible in regards to how we use our words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tongue: so mighty and so horrible. No one can tame it, but we must try, eh?&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>The Government Union</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-government-union/"/> <updated>2009-12-12T00:40:33-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-government-union</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have frequently heard people advocating government jobs. That is, the people that I know will talk about how good it is to be a government employee. They talk about the pension, benefits, and job security, to name a few. All of these things are true. But just as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/519/unions-will-get-you-for-sure/&quot;&gt;unions&lt;/a&gt; will get you in the private sector, so also will the unions affect the public sector. Sometimes the unions in the government are organized, but one could make a case for the entire federal government being one gigantic union that stands against their employer (aka the American people).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-12-10-federal-pay-salaries_N.htm&quot;&gt;USA Today article&lt;/a&gt;, we find out that things are in fact not too good. People are being paid quite a bit nowadays, don’t you think? It is especially interesting that there has been such a boom in government increases during the same time as the private sector losing so many jobs. And by interesting I mean awfully disturbing. The government is becoming a behemoth that is going to continue growing until it collapses and knocks down the support columns that hold up this house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing that I do not understand in the least is how people in government positions can work without the fear of being fired! Whether incompetent or able, they will keep their job (unless perhaps they are grossly ill-performing where even then it will take quite some effort to make a move on them). So when people are presented with the option to try their best or do as little as possible with both seeming to result in the same outcome, what would people do? Exactly, they would do the least possible. There is no incentive for people in government jobs to continue to do their best. Now you see what I am saying about the government employees being similar to a union.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as the unions have been able to cripple portions of the private sector (such as the American automakers), it is going to be the government employees that are going to bring down the government. If you have not read what unions can do to the world, I suggest that you read the ever popular &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/PuUYqb&quot;&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Ayn Rand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the signs are there. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/675/health-care-reform/&quot;&gt;Health care reform&lt;/a&gt; that will dictate much more than we need or want it to, a growing government influence in our lives, a government that dictates what companies will do (since it owns them), perhaps even the degradation of freedoms to which we are rightly entitled to under the Constitution. This is something that concerns all of us, and we all need to care about it. Because we sure are going to have the live with the consequences together. And disregarding warning is a terribly foolhardy thing to do.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Clueless Spokesmen</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/clueless-spokesmen/"/> <updated>2009-12-03T00:12:37-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/clueless-spokesmen</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When there is a disaster happening, the affected agencies always seem to appoint a spokesman. And that spokesman always seems to have no idea what is going on. Is it really that hard to have a spokesman with a little bit of knowledge?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am rather tired of hearing the endless stream of:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;“I do not have that information”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“We are not aware of that at this time”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“I cannot say whether that is true or not”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“I do not know the answer to that”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;“We have not heard of that rumor”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do not understand any of the people that are involved in putting these spokesmen out there!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are the agency or group that is being spoken for, I would think that you want to seem competent. You want to put out someone who is excellent because they are going to be the face of your group. You do not get that if you present someone who cannot even answer the questions that they field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are the person who is to be the spokesman, I would also think that you would want to be knowledgeable of everything that you are supposed to know. Otherwise, as so often happens, you will get roasted by the questions that the audience has. They are going to ask you about what they have heard and apparently their sources are better than yours. So you will sound clueless and lost. Who wants that to be them?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And me? Yeah I just want someone who will give some answers. I can get tired real quickly of hearing people avoid the questions that they just don’t know the answers to. No, lame answers are not better than no answers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On another note, salesmen are just specialized spokesmen that are trying to get your money.

We do not check every fact each and every time otherwise we would go insane! We sit on chairs without checking that the legs will support our weight (although sometimes the chair unfortunately does not support our weight). We figure that our car engine is going to work even though we don’t check it before turning it on everyday. Staplers have staples, light switches will turn on lights, and our e-mail is accessible. These assumptions are slight and imperceptible things that we do. When the assumption does not hold, it is quickly discarded to handle the exceptional case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then there assumptions that have a more costly result. When you and your teammate assume that the other is going to catch the fly ball, you could lose the game. Perhaps you and another drive make an assumption that the other is going to get out of the way and an accident occurs. At work, if no definitive statement is made about who is to carry out a task then all involved will think that the other is doing it. Or in the tragedy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/scraig/gansberg.html&quot;&gt;Kitty Genovese&lt;/a&gt; everyone assumes that someone else will do the right thing. Or infinitely increasing in the depth of tragedy, what happens to someone who assumes that scientists and public opinion are correct enough that Jesus is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the answer?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let us not assume! Especially when it comes to the important things. Else we are complicit in the outcome, whatever that might be.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>iPhone Attention Deficit</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/iphone-attention-deficit/"/> <updated>2009-10-16T01:14:12-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/iphone-attention-deficit</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While there are many advances in mobile technology, there is none more prominent (nowadays anyways) than the Apple iPhone. Subsequent to its release in June 2007, it has made a definite mark on society. It has created huge lines, buzz in media, envy in people’s eyes, and a huge increase in revenue for the companies involved. Despite &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/165/why-hype-up-the-iphone/&quot;&gt;much hype&lt;/a&gt; and doubt, it has been a game-changing device for the smartphone world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has a user interface that is the standard to which all others are (now) compared, it is sleek, it is expensive enough to stay out of the hands of the less privileged (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/179/applegeeks-coachgirls/&quot;&gt;Coach purses for girls&lt;/a&gt;), and it has an entire &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/10/fanaticism/&quot;&gt;fanatical subculture&lt;/a&gt; to support it. There are some people who use it for its useful features, others who just want it so that they can be hip with the times, and others who will probably say that it’s an essential part of their life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing is, I think that we need to help these people. Their iPhones are taking over their lives. Here we thought that Attention-Deficit Disorder (although this has been replaced by Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in psychology as of DSM-IV, but I could not apply the hyperactivity to iPhone users) was something that we could treat. Unfortunately it seems like we are inducing it in people. And while I am talking specifically about the iPhone, the general principle still stands that people are getting worse at maintaining their concentration on tasks at hand. They have instant messaging that they’re always connected to, text messages that encourage deplorable grammar, and the ever annoying Twitter (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/83/tweedle-dee-twitter-dumb/&quot;&gt;dumb as far back as 2007&lt;/a&gt;), which combines all of these things at one time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most people with iPhones seem to have an incessant need to check them. People need to stop this. They need to start living lives that do not involve the Internet. Let us move onward from our digital slavery!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am slightly amused that I am writing such a thing for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hello this is a blog, which is an entirely digital medium.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I am in front of a computer at least 8 hours a day as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/about/&quot;&gt;software engineer&lt;/a&gt;.

And health services are not perfect at all. They (medical professionals) charge more than what seems reasonable, and they do not seem to have to answer to anybody except for the health insurance companies because they only listen to the money. It would be nice to have personal doctors and nurses to tend to your every whim. And it would be nice if you did not have to pay anything for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But this is not how the world works. For one, medical professionals are people as well. I am talking about doctors, not the rank and file like staff and assistants. These are individuals who have gone to school, invested hours and nights to their profession. (Well at least I hope that they have. The ones that have not are not ones that I would ever want to go to.) Their work is indeed important, and it is at times worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People sometimes claim that a single entity watching over the entire operation here in the United States will be more efficient. More efficient? Since when did a government project ever win awards for efficiency?? Yeah that’s a pretty crazy &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.house.gov/gopleader/House-Democrats-Health-Plan.pdf&quot;&gt;health plan chart&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t it? It is only a guess at what the new health government would look like, but it sure is a scary one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If everyone has access to all of the doctors, people are going to take as much as they can. Do you think that you will get to pay the best doctor what he/she is charging? Well when everything costs the same for everyone it just logically follows that the best doctors are going to be as busy as people can schedule appointments. People dismiss the supposed “death panels” that will decide on life and death decisions for everyone, but if there is a shortage of supply (doctors) compared to the increase in demand (patients) then some of those patients will have to be left out. There is just no possible other way for that outcome to be different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is pretty debatable whether or not other countries have succeeded at this or not. That is not really the question. The question is: do I really want to cede more control over my life to the federal government? To that I say no, I am still a huge fan of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/512/10th-amendment/&quot;&gt;10th amendment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Sensitive To Humor</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/sensitive-to-humor/"/> <updated>2009-10-02T01:20:26-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/sensitive-to-humor</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/N8Y0lX&quot;&gt;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&lt;/a&gt; recently with some other people. I thought that the movie was amusing. It was not uproarious, but I was definitely amused. It was just in line with Monty Python and the Flying Circus (the TV show), of which I occasionally partake of. A TV show very well remembered for its SPAM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However everyone else did not find it amusing at all. As in, they thought the 90 odd minutes spent watching it were painful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Non sequiturs, absurdism, plays on words, and more. These are all things that make some people SPAMMILY laugh. And apparently some people cannot endure it at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humor is a strange thing. It is not the same for everyone. Often there is overlap. However other times there is something funny to someone and not funny at all to someone else. Sometimes the only way that we realize that we are alone in our humor is when we are laughing before we receive social cues that it’s not funny. Some people don’t even have any sense of humor at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t have any answers.

Maybe I’m dense or maybe this will be helpful to someone out there. If you have a Garmin GPS device, and it gives you an error that says “Can’t Unlock Maps” then try:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Register online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.garmin.com/&quot;&gt;myGarmin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Find your unlock codes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Connect your device to your computer&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a file gmapprom.unl and paste the unlock codes into it, one to a line&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Put the file onto the Garmin device inside of the Garmin folder&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It is probably also a good idea to install and update software as necessary&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a very odd error because it seemed to happen out of nowhere. One minute the device was working fine, and then turning it off and on seemed to somehow allow that file to magically disappear. Not good, Garmin, not good. Don’t let it happen again!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If that fix doesn’t work out for you, you can check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/QO2zNz&quot;&gt;some of the latest and greatest new Garmin devices&lt;/a&gt; instead.  They look pretty snazzy.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Serious Gaming</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/serious-gaming/"/> <updated>2009-09-24T01:05:49-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/serious-gaming</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I enjoy a board (or sometimes card or tile) game just as much as anyone else. They are good clean fun that often test particular skills and attributes. There are games like scrabble and speed scrabble, which test your vocabulary and literacy; chess, which tests your planning capabilities; and Nertz, which tests speed and awareness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I enjoy the games, I do not always enjoy the people that play the games. I mean what is up with people that take games too seriously? Games are fun, and I will play as hard as I can. But it is never appealing when things get out of hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In particular there are some games that I cannot stand playing with other people because they tend to get much too involved in them. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catan.com/&quot;&gt;Settlers of Catan&lt;/a&gt; is one of those games. Since so much of the game is the relationships between the players in the game, it is extremely susceptible to antagonism, back-stabbing, and bitterness. All lovely attributes. It is an excellent game if you want to see the ugly in people, that’s for sure. People cannot help but reveal themselves a little bit when it gets competitive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will always remember a friend that I knew who was willing to give up a game (in that case basketball) because he was enticed to behave badly while playing. He thought that there were more important things in the world, namely his Christianity, so he gave it up.

While &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/5/algorithm-for-your-life/&quot;&gt;everyone thinks that they’re right&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like it’s getting easier (in this increasingly relativistic society) for people to change their mind after committing. They think that they’re right even when they go back on what they have previously said. They just rationalize away the facts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A man is only as good as his word&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This saying is often used, and it is one that has stuck with me over the years. Let’s face it, nobody appreciates someone who backpedals when the going gets tough. Neither friends, family, or employer will ever enjoy someone whose word is unreliable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you find that you’re in an un&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/142/tenable/&quot;&gt;tenable&lt;/a&gt; position because you overextended, perhaps you should have thought about it before you extended. When you are out there, you have to deal with the consequences. Next time remember to calculate the cost before giving your word.

It is therefore logical to conclude that each person will encounter strangers. Some people are good at talking to and interacting with them while others are completely unable to do it. Whether it is in line at the grocery store, waiting at the post office, going to a friend’s party (where there are some people that you know and some that you don’t), or sitting at a wedding banquet, it’s pretty easy to see how you handle strangers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I find it rather strange that sometimes it’s actually easier to talk to strangers than it is to talk to people that you already know, especially those that you have not interacted with in awhile, and it’s especially true for those that you only know superficially. With people that you knew before, it seems like it gets awkward after the initial greeting whereas (depending on the strangers) it can be much more enjoyable to find out about a person from the start as the conversation continues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my case, I often hope &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to have to talk to people that I know superficially previously, especially in situations that will span a considerable time (like the aforementioned wedding banquet scenario). It is worlds less awkward to talk to strangers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although if the stranger is out to rob, punch, or otherwise do harm to me I reserve the right to prefer a person that I know superficially. And if the stranger is dull and uninteresting, then I also reserve the right to hate talking to the stranger.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Understanding Domains</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/understanding-domains/"/> <updated>2009-09-03T01:12:24-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/understanding-domains</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I could have your attention, I would rather like to quickly rant about something that I see all of the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;People pay for their own domain name&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Those same people want to get e-mail&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Those people proceed to register an e-mail address with some free webmail (e.g., Yahoo!, Google, etc)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why does require a rant? Because they paid for their own domain! Instead of having to register SomeOrganizationSomeGroup@gmail.com, they could very well just decide that they want to get SomeGroup@TheirDomain.com. Doesn’t that seem more appealing? Isn’t that more professional and more enjoyable? Yes, yes I think that we can all agree to that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only argument that I can think of is that people want to be able to use the webmail clients to access their e-mail. I hear ya. But maybe more importantly, Google hears ya. I don’t want to be a Google salesman, but their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html&quot;&gt;standard edition of Google Apps&lt;/a&gt; is pretty free. And that will pretty much take care of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Together, we can combat annoying-to-remember e-mail addresses.

&lt;h4 id=&quot;readme&quot;&gt;README&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s some help for understanding this snippet of Python programming code. While you are unmarried, you are either dating someone or you are not. If you’re not dating and happen to find someone that you want to date, then lucky you! The next categorization is you are either actively pursuing marriage or you are not. If you are, I think that you should want to go on interesting dates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life isn’t dinner and a movie. Life is crazy and uncertain. It’s hard and difficult. Don’t you want to see how the person that you might spend the rest of your life with reacts? When they’re fording a river, do they get angry and upset with you? When you’re lost in the wilderness, do they get upset and frustrated? When you get frustrated with them, do they snap back? Find the worst in the person. Look for it as hard as you possibly can. Because if you can handle the worst, then you can definitely handle the best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you aren’t as actively pursuing marriage then enjoy your dinner and movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if you’re not dating then good luck with being on your own and all of the issues entailed in CT’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/august/16.22.html&quot;&gt;The Case For Early Marriage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Unions Will Get You For Sure</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/unions-will-get-you-for-sure/"/> <updated>2009-08-12T01:08:44-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/unions-will-get-you-for-sure</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Labor unions have their origins as recently as the 18th century and in the United States of America in the 19th century. Quite simply a union is an entity that represents the collective interests of its members, often associated with workers of a similar profession. They were extremely important in yesteryear when “the Man” would snuff the very life out of people with his unyielding desire for more profit, even at the expense of people’s lives. Unions were an answer to this vileness. They allowed the workers to stand united against injustice and fight for their rights as human beings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But now &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are getting despicable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In striving for (or at least claiming to strive for) the best possible situations for its members, the power-hungry leaders of unions are wielding weapons that they seem ill-equipped to handle. They know only to grab all that they can at no expense. There are so many different groups reaching for as much as they possibly can that they threaten the very structures upon which they stand!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unions make it easy for people to get as much as they can while also being protecting from punishment for not doing their job. Do you think that it’s a coincidence that the automakers in Detroit have huge unions and are also now going bankrupt? What about the education system (especially locally in southern California) that is floundering for money? Those teacher unions sure are big and powerful, aren’t they? I say that if they had just been reasonable about what they wanted and did (e.g., protecting from unjust terminations instead of deserved terminations) then perhaps we all would be a little bit better off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States of America, we stand for things. Our Constitution says that we have rights. But those rights do not include a guaranteed source of income nor a completely secure job. We are not entitled to a house nor do we deserve free health care, but I digress. Our rights do include the ability to work as hard as you can to achieve things. And in our current society, it sure seems like we could get ride of unions and let the best of the workers survive (because they will always be sought after as good workers).&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Police On Phone</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/police-on-phone/"/> <updated>2009-07-31T01:15:13-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/police-on-phone</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m never a fan of people talking on their cell phones while they’re driving. And now I’m even less of a fan since it’s blatently against the law (whereas before it was just selfish to put others at risk). They definitely don’t drive as well, and that is a problem if I am driving near them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if I see a police officer talking on their cell phone? Yeah, that’s another layer on top of that! They’re supposed to be working, and I am fairly confident in my ability to say that they’re not talking about work on their cell phone. They are also not doing their job as well. And that affects me just as much as it affects you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nobody thinks that police are perfect. In fact they do all types of blatent things. They speed (even when not purposefully chasing someone), they are sympathetic, patronizing, power hungry, and on occasion corrupt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well these are happy thoughts!

And there is a whole world of accessories out there. For the first couple of weeks I was keeping my camera in a FedEx bag because it is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;inconspicuous&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cheap&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;slightly padded&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;water resistant&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;That seems like a pretty good list to me! But alas I knew that it could not last. Unfortunately, bags (from companies that market them as camera bags) are fairly overpriced. Okay they’re not terribly expensive compared to the actual camera, but I rather enjoyed some of the unique aspects of my FedEx bag. I wanted to keep most of its positive attributes without having to bear the shame of actually holding a FedEx bag all of the time. Here is my bag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First I got:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;a canvas bag from my local Army/Navy military surplus store, which was a lot less rugged than I would have imagined&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;craft foam and ripstop nylon fabric from JoAnn Fabric and Crafts (the higher quality foam that I wanted to buy online had an unfortunately prohibitive shipping cost that was higher than the foam itself)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cardboard from a shipping box that I already had&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;my sewing machine (which isn’t actually mine and which I had never used before this project)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;velcro with adhesive backing (I already had this)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;Raw goods after purchase&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2637/3722068453_2f366f6cb5.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My idea was to create my own padded inserts to put into the canvas bag. I was going to use the craft foam as the filler, cardboard to stiffen the insert, and the nylon to wrap the whole deal. I made a number of inserts, and each of them had a similar method of creation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess that I didn’t take any pictures of my initial steps, but all I did was measure and cut the desired size of foam, cardboard, and nylon. I cut enough nylon to wrap the foam and cardboard like a present.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next I pinned the fabric according to how tight I wanted it to be around the foam. I generally was going for pretty tight because I thought that it would give it a more professional appearance. For the most part I think that was correct because I saw other examples of loosely wrapped inserts that people made online that did not look as nice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;Pinned fabric ready to be sewn&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3419/3722886662_1141e0ac2c.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I inserted the foam and cardboard into the sewn nylon. This was actually one of the most difficult steps because the nylon was getting sewn with the intent of there being a tight fit. And a tight fit it was! I was able to eventually get all of them into their nylon sleeves, but some of them were quite difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;Foam going into the nylon&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3722072177_0c660c2227.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I then closed up the nylon and pinned it so that I could hand stitch it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;Pinned nylon ready for hand stitching&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3482/3722071175_766ef3f6af.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I used (or tried to use) a hidden stitch when I was hand stitching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;Hand sewn and completed foam insert&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2547/3722884054_56a8d4374e.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I repeated that process a number of times so that I could have the appropriate number of bag inserts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;All of the completed inserts&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2583/3722887336_b66e28ace6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My final step was to attach some velcro so that the pieces would hold their form. I’m still working on this step, though, because I have since found that the adhesive on the velcro is insufficient to keep the velcro on the nylon. I am pretty sure that using some kind of glue (maybe even fabric or super) will do the trick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;All of the materials completed!&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3472/3722888066_c450201797.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;500&quot; title=&quot;Here&#39;s my camera bag&quot; src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3722257961_dcabf8cafd.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s fairly inconspicuous, modestly priced (total for everything is under $50 compared to over $100 for the bags that I wanted, and I have leftover material), padded, and now I have skills that I didn’t have before!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, if after reading this you decide that it’s still not worth it to sew all of the inserts yourself then you could just buy a commercial camera bag insert like &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/P6vRtH&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, and put it into whatever bag you want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inspiration came from: - &lt;a href=&quot;http://howto.wired.com/wiki/Make_a_Stealth_Camera_Bag&quot;&gt;Wired - How To Make A Stealth Camera Bag&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the3dstudio.com/blog_detail.aspx?id=640&quot;&gt;Make Your Own Customized Camera Bag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Barefoot Running</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/barefoot-running/"/> <updated>2009-07-10T01:10:25-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/barefoot-running</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That title probably gets your attention. As is common knowledge, we need shoes in order to run. Running barefoot is impossible to comprehend. Except…it’s not. There are so many reasons that I have found that compel me to run barefoot. And I figured that now would be a good time to post them here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have been running barefoot for over 9 months now. I started off running a few blocks, and I have progressed to now run a few miles a couple of times each week. Yes, it will sometimes be briefly uncomfortable when I step on a pebble, but it is usually gone in the next step. However for most people the thought of pain is enough to prevent them from ever trying to run barefoot. On the other hand, just because I run on the street does not mean that everyone has to. &lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; title=&quot;Yep, they&#39;re mine&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2554/3706453438_b247aaa513_m.jpg&quot; /&gt; Running on sand or grass would definitely be more comfortable, but it’s really not that bad running on the pavement (in my opinion). I believe that running barefoot is better, and I want my behavior to be in accordance with my beliefs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I was &lt;strong&gt;not born&lt;/strong&gt; with shoes. (Of course I also wasn’t born with clothes, but clothes don’t injure me. If they did, I wouldn’t wear those either.)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injuries increase with the price&lt;/strong&gt; of the shoes according to surveys from runners.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It’s recommended (by pediatricians) that &lt;strong&gt;young children be allowed to walk around barefoot&lt;/strong&gt; so that they can develop their feet. There must be something there, right?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;By the laws of &lt;strong&gt;physics&lt;/strong&gt; the force of each step when running has to be translated and absorved somewhere. Running sure isn’t hurting your feet. Where does that leave? Perhaps the knees and hips?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Tough and hardened feet are much more &lt;strong&gt;useful&lt;/strong&gt; than soft tender feet. Soft feet are nice to the touch, but they can’t nearly do what used feet can do. If you had to run away from danger, you can’t exactly stop to put on your shoes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Without the artificial support of shoes, your feet need to balance and adapt. That is, the &lt;strong&gt;muscles and tendons in your feet will get stronger&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s similar to why it’s excellent to do exercises without artificial support. You need to balance while also performing the task at hand. And that will make you stronger and strengthen the entire structure.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There sure are a lot of people from &lt;strong&gt;other countries&lt;/strong&gt; that are awesome runners without the need for shoes. Have you ever thought about that? Not only are they awesome, but they have lower incidence of injury. Just because I wasn’t born in a culture like that does not mean that I cannot become like that!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I stand for &lt;strong&gt;freedom&lt;/strong&gt;!. I always have, I always will. But it is a different kind of freedom that I feel when I’m running barefoot. It kind of makes me feel like a little kid, and I love that.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The arch is one of the strongest structures known to man. We use it for bridges to hold up amazing amounts of weight. Have you ever seen an arched bridge have something filling the entire arch? No. That’s because the &lt;strong&gt;arch is strongest when there is nothing filling that gap&lt;/strong&gt;. Surprise, surprise guess where we have an arch.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;One of the most important reason to consider running barefoot is that it makes you more &lt;strong&gt;conscious of your running form&lt;/strong&gt;. So while your form might suffer when you’re running with shod feet, you won’t modify your behavior because it doesn’t manifest itself until years of running have beaten your body down. However you will definitely notice the difference with bare feet. You will not strike your heel. You will land on the balls of your feet. You will be careful of where you go. You could learn how to run with better form from someone teaching you. But that doesn’t mean that you’re necessarily going to change. Pain is a much better way to modify your behavior than mere information. It’s a reminder every step that you need to run correctly.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I run barefoot. I enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;References:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsci.org/jour/0103/mw.htm&quot;&gt;SportSci - Running Barefoot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1170253/The-painful-truth-trainers-Are-expensive-running-shoes-waste-money.html&quot;&gt;The Painful Truth About Trainers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://barefootrunner.org/&quot;&gt;Barefoot Rick&lt;/a&gt; - I enjoyed reading some of his articles and thoughts about running barefoot.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Do It, Arnold</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/do-it-arnold/"/> <updated>2009-07-01T01:14:13-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/do-it-arnold</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The whole situation with the California budget crisis is ridiculous. It is looking very likely that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE55T7E120090630&quot;&gt;California will have to issue IOUs&lt;/a&gt; as the new fiscal year rolls around. How did we get into this pickle? The recession! The decreased revenue from falling property taxes and lack of state income taxes from those who are not working has left the Golden State in a huge predicament. $24.3 BILLION?? That is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the special election on May 19, 2009, the people of this state voted against the increased taxes that were proposed. I am a fairly modest supporter of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger&quot;&gt;Governator&lt;/a&gt; as he is standing against the tide. I agree with his observation that the people of California are sick and tired of living in the most taxed state of the United States of America! Even though he has not always been my favorite politician (really who is?), I am glad that he is attempting to stand for what he thinks that the people want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Democratic state politicians on the other hard are, inexplicably, ridiculous. While they, too, are trying to stand for what they think that the people want, they are doing it in a way that is illogical. From trying to find loopholes to pass the budget with a simple majority (since they can’t pass what they want without Republican support) to trying to pass tax increases along with budget cuts, they are not making the process extremely difficult. They are still trying to get theirs while seeming to not understand what basic tasks they need to do in order to get the state’s finances in order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let us put it simply: California &lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt; to cut its costs. It doesn’t have the money and at this point it is not reasonable to increase the taxes that it imposes on its population. At some point people are going to get tired of paying so much for the privilege of wonderful weather (and horrible smog). I wonder if the politicians know this. Maybe good old Mr. Olympia himself knows.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Pay Me In Silence</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/pay-me-in-silence/"/> <updated>2009-06-25T01:10:47-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/pay-me-in-silence</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Silence is golden at the movies. How much is it worth everywhere else? It’s usually trouble to dispense knowledge and wisdom to everyone around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People don’t like to be told what to do. Have you ever noticed that it is sometimes harder to tell those that are close to you about something compared to telling those that are not as close? Why is it that a close friend or family member can tell you something that will cause a negative knee-jerk reaction when the same opinion from a perceived detached and objective party will be received well?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems to me like part of wisdom is knowing when to be quiet and give others a chance to succeed. Surprise, surprise maybe other people don’t want me to solve all of their problems, even if I could. Perhaps maybe a little more love in all things, without which I am nothing even if I am the wisest person in the world.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Maybe I'll Miss That Pit</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/maybe-ill-miss-that-pit/"/> <updated>2009-06-20T01:40:28-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/maybe-ill-miss-that-pit</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boundless.org/2005/articles/a0002060.cfm&quot;&gt;The Long Journey From Obesity&lt;/a&gt;, I started to realize that I was like the author before she became an obese person. At times I look down on obese people because I think that it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; possible for them to lose weight. And while I still do think that it is true for them in a lot of cases, I can easily lose sight of the fact that being skinny is not the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are skinny gluttonous people and there are larger fit people. Size is not of the utmost importance.

It’s a straight forward application that allows you to create a set of accounts that have rules assigned to them, which dictate how to split up whole account deposits (e.g., a paycheck). I originally had the idea because I wanted to start budgeting using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/199/is-the-40-30-20-10-rule-too-ideal/&quot;&gt;40-30-20-10 rule&lt;/a&gt;. But then I realized that I wanted to use the idea but customize it a little bit more for my needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But enough about the details. On to my point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I am working on Budse by myself. I started the project, and it has been a one-man show the whole time. As an individual developer working on an open source project, sometimes I dream. I start to think big about people actually using it. Big dreams, I know. Haha currently I doubt it if anyone aside from me uses it. When I was coding and especially when I was deciding on how to license it, I thought that since it fulfilled my need it would be useful to other people as well. Maybe that’s not true. Maybe it is. It remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is so easy to dream of becoming great. But maybe dreaming big isn’t such a bad thing. Maybe if I lost the ability to dream big, I would lose a little bit of who I am. So while I am currently unsatisfied with its use, I am definitely going to press forward!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>What Is Marriage?</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/what-is-marriage/"/> <updated>2009-06-11T11:40:41-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/what-is-marriage</id> <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re pretty much married already.

In fact there is a difference between marriage and any other state that one can be in (e.g., single, friends, partners)!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But to the rest of the world, it seems like marriage is only an extra special promise to be faithful. And legal rights and benefits. Really, that’s all it is to a large part of the world? “I do. I definitely promise not to be unfaithful to you.

At one time! I am still a little bit shocked at this turn of events. I have turned from being someone who hated running in high school to someone who enjoyed it as a getaway from the computer lab in college to someone who runs these kinds of races in their free time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do have a few amusing things that I want to jot down for posterity’s sake:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-fundraising&quot;&gt;The Fundraising&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially I was only thinking of what I could get out of running a marathon. First off I could say that I ran a marathon. I could learn about myself and what I’m made of. And so on and so forth. But part of the way through the training I decided to run for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/582/team-world-vision/&quot;&gt;Team World Vision&lt;/a&gt;. It was rewarding to be able to realize even in the midst of such a solitary sport that I could be doing this for other people. It was good to get to spread the word a little bit about what World Vision is doing in parts of the world, and it’s even better to be able to raise funds for a charity that is spreading the love of Jesus Christ in tangible ways to our world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m still accepting donations so I welcome you to visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstgiving.com/derekwong&quot;&gt;my donation page&lt;/a&gt; and consider joining with me to support this charity. And a &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; thanks to everyone that has already supported me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-toe&quot;&gt;The Toe&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;On May 20th, I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.costco.com/Home.aspx&quot;&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; to get my tires changed. Prior to this I had moved one of my existing tires to the spare tire because I had a nail in the sidewall. Basically this meant that my spare was usable but just barely. So I asked the tire center at Costco to move one of the existing tires to the spare so that it would be a little more reliable if it ever had to be used. I asked them if they did it when I picked it up, but I wasn’t confident that they did it as I had asked them. So I wanted to check it out for myself when I got home. As I was pulling the tire out from under my truck, it hit the toenail on my right big toe and separated the nail from the flesh a bit. I just stared at it because I was in shock. I had &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; read a post about &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/209645/hack-attack-how-to-hack-a-marathon&quot;&gt;hacking a marathon&lt;/a&gt; in which Adam Pash of Lifehacker fame briefly mentions messing up his big toe before his first marathon. I, of course, thought something like that would never happen to me. But that is also why &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/594/i-hate-murphy/&quot;&gt;I Hate Murphy&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy&#39;s_law&quot;&gt;Murphy’s Law&lt;/a&gt; fame). So I’m staring at my big toe, and blood is starting to come out. Thankfully I washed up, wrapped it up, and later applied some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newskinproducts.com/liquid-bandage.htm&quot;&gt;liquid bandage&lt;/a&gt; that took care of weather-sealing the wound. While it could have been pretty horrible, it all turned out alright. In fact it was the least of my worries during the actual running. On the other hand it did make the days leading up to the marathon more stressful!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-mob&quot;&gt;The Mob&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;I made the mistake (&lt;strong&gt;again!&lt;/strong&gt;) of starting off further back in the full field. That meant that there were a lot of people in front of me that were going to be running (or even walking!) slower than me. So I had to weave in and out for the first 6 miles at least. Stupid urge to urinate right before the start even though I had done so at Union Station a half hour earlier!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-band&quot;&gt;The Band&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, my Iliotibial Band started to hurt. This is the same injury that I experienced when I ran my half marathon. And all of this, I am guessing, happened because I was not paying attention to my form at all in the beginning while running through the crowd. I started to feel the effects of it near mile 10, but it didn’t actually start to hurt until perhaps mile 15 or 16.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-wall&quot;&gt;The Wall&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially I did not think that I &lt;a href=&quot;http://marathonandbeyond.com/choices/latta.htm&quot;&gt;hit The Wall&lt;/a&gt;. But now that I’m thinking back about what happened in the last 6 or 7 miles of the race, I might have to change my answer. Reasons why I might have hit The Wall after all:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hallucination - I thought that a mile marker was coming up. Then I looked up again, and it was nowhere in sight.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Forgetfulness - I lost track of what mile I was on near mile 24. Or was that mile 23…&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dead tired - Usually I fancy myself strong of mind. But there were quite a few points where I could &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; psych myself up to start running. I just felt like I was stuck.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Focus - It was near impossible to think about anything else except for finishing. I could not multi-task with my brain.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes it sucked a lot. And no you have no idea what it feels like unless you experience it. Everyone should. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-pace&quot;&gt;The Pace&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started off on great pace to finish in 4 hours. That would been extremely ideal. However I started to peter off as the race went on such that I eventually was trying to struggle to complete in 4:15. And that didn’t even happen. Thankfully I did finish under my overall goal of under 4:30.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-near-fight&quot;&gt;The Near Fight&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generally people in and around a marathon are going to be pleasant and full of good cheer. But as I was running I noticed that there was a middle aged Causasian male runner who was getting into it a little bit with a young Hispanic male on a bike. I didn’t see what happened, but they were talking as if I was about to see some fisticuffs right there. My guess is that someone ran into someone else, which almost caused a much more devastating accident. I steered clear of them and picked up my pace to get away!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-stairs&quot;&gt;The Stairs&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;After running a marathon, take my word and walk down stairs backwards. I look dumb, I know. But it feels worlds better than walking down like a normal person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-days-after&quot;&gt;The Day(s) After&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take it off from work if at all possible. Luckily this is possible for me. I was tremendously sore from head to toe. The soreness ranged from my shoulders and back to my entire legs and even my foot! In fact every step that I took with my left foot felt like there was a ball underneath it. Imagine my surprise at discovering this when I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom! The day immediately following the marathon was definitely one of the most sore days of my life. I was hobbling around like a crippled old man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;So there you have some of my thoughts. I hope that you enjoyed them (if you read them). If you just skipped them, that’s fine as well. It’s your loss. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely do not regret doing the marathon. It did indeed teach me about myself, and the whole experience is something that will have forever changed me. Doing one is completely different than hearing about it from others. Will I do another? Who knows. A guy that I chatted with a little bit before the start encouraged me to not be someone who is “one and done.” It took a lot of time to train for it, and I was still definitely feeling the effects of doing such an extreme thing. But considering all that I learned, and all of the health benefits that I received I would count it as something well worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh and if you’re wondering, here are my &lt;a href=&quot;http://results.active.com/pages/oneResult.jsp?pID=59611336&amp;amp;rsID=78608&quot;&gt;official results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>I Hate Murphy</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/i-hate-murphy/"/> <updated>2009-05-21T22:30:45-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/i-hate-murphy</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And that is it. More to come after I have all of my thoughts on everything surrounding the marathon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am glad that I don’t have a friend named Murphy otherwise he will think that I hate him.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Can't Stand The Ugliness</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/cant-stand-the-ugliness/"/> <updated>2009-05-13T01:10:50-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/cant-stand-the-ugliness</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People enjoy their modern lives where things are the way that they are. They have always been that way. Changes disrupt that happy life. Even trying to dig beyond the surface reveals things that they are loathe to consider.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take meat for example. While there are vegans who abolish all animal products from their life, there are still a great number of people that do not. They are happy to go to a chop house and order a nice big steak. Many people that I know would opt for a simmering and perfectly cooked as a last meal. How many of them would be shocked to see the cow butchered to produce said steak? I know that it would be quite a sight to behold myself. But many people who would eat a well-cooked steak in a heartbeat would turn away equally fast from seeing how that steak came to be. And yet, that is all part of the process. It is no less true than the steak that sits in front of them in a fancy restaurant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moving a step in the more offensive category, what about abortion? Depending on whose statistics you believe, there is probably about half of the population that thinks that abortion is just fine and dandy. And how many of those people do you think would be willing to see what actually happens during an abortion? Just ask groups like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.survivors.la/&quot;&gt;Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust&lt;/a&gt;, a Christian pro-life activism group that aims to educate high school and college students, about what they encounter when they go out. With their huge graphic displays, they offend people because it brings to light things that they don’t want to see. I have read articles about them getting into heated shouting matches and even getting arrested. Arrested for free speech?! In our enlightened society?!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who are pro-abortion like to think of themselves as pro-choice. They’re about the ability to choose something. That’s freedom! But when things start to ge a little more real than that, I am sure that they will be some of the first to avert their eyes. They will get heated because they will have to face the reality, which is ugly to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People love their nice packaged lives. They enjoy that everything is so nice and prepared for them. Abstractions are so much easier than the real thing. Get a grip people, there’s definitely more to things than what you want.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Vicarious Living</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/vicarious-living/"/> <updated>2009-05-06T01:20:04-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/vicarious-living</id> <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;He lives vicariously…through himself. -The Most Interesting Man In The World (Dos Equis Commercial)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parents do it through kids, friends do it through friends. It happens when you watch television shows, sports games, and internet videos. You envy someone else’s life. They have it better than you. Or maybe they just have the &lt;em&gt;opportunity&lt;/em&gt; to have it better than you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of discovering all that you can do with what you have, you choose to focus your attention on someone else. Their success is your success. Except it really isn’t. It’s still their success. At best, the focus of your attention will give you credit and thanks. At worst, you get nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why live a life that is so unfulfilled? (I feel rather like I am a motivational speaker right now.) But there is so much to be content with! I can enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbc.com/The_Biggest_Loser/&quot;&gt;The Biggest Loser&lt;/a&gt; because it is (at its root) about people learning that they can achieve what they could only dream about before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is fantastic to be glad that someone has gone and done something great. But I can’t help but always wonder at people when they don’t realize that they could get places that they never dreamed of as well.

Well what about finishing it and getting to help a worthy cause? That is even better! I was talking with a friend today, and she suggested that it would be a good idea to raise money for a charity since I have been doing all of this training already. After I thought about it, I realized that it made a lot of sense. People seem to be willing to help out since they can see that it is something that I would care about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looked at a number of very worthy charities before I decided that I wanted to be a part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldvision.org/content.nsf/getinvolved/teamwv&quot;&gt;Team World Vision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From their website:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;World Vision is a Christian humanitarian charity organization dedicated to working with children, families, and their communities worldwide to reach their full potential by tackling the causes of poverty and injustice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in joining with me to donate to a worthy cause, please visit my fundraising page:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstgiving.com/derekwong&quot;&gt;Derek’s fundraising page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Changing Permalinks</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/changing-permalinks/"/> <updated>2009-04-25T10:30:40-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/changing-permalinks</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh boy that was sweet. Okay let me qualify that by saying that I enjoy when things are easy and efficient. If you feel differently, then you may very well disagree with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So on a nice lazy morning I decided to look into converting my permalink structure to one that I preferred. Permalinks are how Wordpress describes permanent links to a post. When I first started this blog a couple of years ago (seriously, that long??) I decided on going with a fairly standard /yyyy/mm/dd/post-name type of structure for my posts. However, I am now a little opposed to this since it reveals more information than I would like. I tend to think that my writing transcends time since I am not usually writing about current events so I want to remove a visitor’s perception that my post is not worth reading just because it is old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After searching online, I came upon Scott Yang’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://scott.yang.id.au/code/permalink-redirect/&quot;&gt;Permalink Redirect plugin&lt;/a&gt;. The instructions seemed easy enough so I:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Downloaded it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unzipped, installed, and activated it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accessed the new Settings-&amp;gt;Permalink Redirect page. Under “Old Permalink Structure” clicked the link after “Current permalink structure”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accessed Settings-&amp;gt;Permalinks. Changed to a /post-id/post-name structure. (I used tags that I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Structure_Tags&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of my old links are now redirecting correctly! And that, my friends and enemies, is sweet! Especially since it took less time than it has taken me to write this post. I’m loving &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; all over again for its abilities, both built-in and extensible.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Chaffing, Cracks And Other Fun</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/chaffing-cracks-and-other-fun/"/> <updated>2009-04-16T13:16:14-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/chaffing-cracks-and-other-fun</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yep, I am still training for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2009/02/03/marathon/&quot;&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;. Some lessons that I have been learning:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are very likely under the impression that cotton is a glorious and soft fabric. But let me tell you that 15 miles can dictate otherwise. &lt;strong&gt;Chaffing is real, people. And it’s dangerous.&lt;/strong&gt; It is just crazy how such a small discomfort can completely occupy your mind. It is a nice reminder to get yourself set up completely before setting out. So beware for certain parts of your body. Personally it happens with my crotch and nipples. Is that too much information? Haha TOO BAD! :D&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seriously? &lt;strong&gt;Cracks in the sidewalk&lt;/strong&gt;? In fact yes. I thought it ludicrous to even consider them. How hard is it to just watch where you’re running? If there’s a crack, don’t trip on it. It’s obvious, it’s simple. And I failed. Yes, that is correct. I was running a while ago, and I was paying attention to the jacket that I was holding in my hand. Next thing I knew, I was stumbling and nearly on my face. Thanks to the amazing reflexes that God placed in me, I was able to remain upright. Really, I couldn’t believe that I didn’t eat some cement right there. A passing truck saw and slowed down, but continued on their way once they saw that I had not even fallen down. I counted my lucky stars and was thankful (once again) for reflexes that are faster than I can say, “Oh no!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Running along major streets leads to some interesting scenarios. People driving by can be placed into a few categories:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haters&lt;/strong&gt; - They will try their very hardest to scare me with honks and shouts. Usually they’re in high school, and they have so little in their life to be excited about that the best thing to happen to them would be to see others suffer. Pretty much they’re retarded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encouragers&lt;/strong&gt; - When passing they either honk in a more friendly way or yell out encouragement. I appreciate that, and I think that’s right kind of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leerers&lt;/strong&gt; - This probably happens much more to girls, but there are definitely those that will make comments that are somewhat lascivious. As a guy, I actually think that it’s awesome to get that. Haha don’t judge me. A girl yelled, “Sexy!” when I was running without a shirt a little while back. Why didn’t I have a shirt on? Because I can! Well that’s only partly true. It was also pretty hot and… see the point about chaffing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you so desire, you can see my &lt;a href=&quot;http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=paQawpLdPpn-M47OHMSL-GA&quot;&gt;LA Marathon 2009 training log&lt;/a&gt; for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Needs Blemishes</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/needs-blemishes/"/> <updated>2009-04-10T18:00:36-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/needs-blemishes</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When something is too good everyone thinks that something is wrong. A little while back I made a T-shirt, and it surprisingly turned out decently. Considering that I am not very artistic, it was rather miraculous that the lines were straight and the overall presentation was just fine. However, the most interesting thing that I found was that people that saw it did not realize that I did it freehand. Since the lines were straight and everything looked good, there were some that just thought that I used a stencil while other people did not even realize that I had made the shirt!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is easy and natural for people to only believe something if they can see the flaw in it. Else they will think that something is amiss (e.g., a machine made the product and you are trying to pass it off as your own work). Most of the time this is spot-on. People are imperfect. Everyone knows this. Why else would we need Jesus? Still it’s rather amusing to note that while people can assume that perfection in other people is acceptable, perfection is a piece of handiwork is odd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sing on it Nat King Cole (&lt;em&gt;Mona Lisa&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Marathon Training And Then Some</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/marathon-training-and-then-some/"/> <updated>2009-03-31T01:20:40-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/marathon-training-and-then-some</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So lately when people have asked me what has been going on, it’s pretty much been work (which is obviously going to be every weekday) and training for the 2009 Los Angeles Marathon. I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2009/02/03/marathon/&quot;&gt;sign up for it&lt;/a&gt; a little while back, and now is as good of a time as any for a little update.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While training for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/15/half-marathon/&quot;&gt;half marathon&lt;/a&gt; was a good introduction, it wasn’t nearly as intense. The thing about marathons is that they are known to be much more difficult to do without training. A half marathon (at 13.1 miles) is daunting, but it is still doable without too much training. But with 26.2 miles, there is the very real chance of “hitting the wall” (where the energy is depleted from the runner’s system leaving little left to continue on). And there are even some very well-publicized cases of people dying during a marathon. I want to train so that those things will not happen to me!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have definitely found out that something that you do not get right away is how much of a commitment this is. Training takes a large amount of time! I am on week 10 (out of 16 weeks) of my training, and I am running about 25-30 miles weekly. Holy moly! All of that training consists of an average of 45 minutes for the non-long runs and upwards of 3 hours (so far) for my long runs. I have a single long run each week that comprises less than half of my weekly mileage. And both my long runs and my weekly mileage will (and should) continue to increase. All told, I am spending a significant portion of my time on this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What have I learned from training thus far?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;A commitment to exercise and health is life-changing. And not easy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perseverance and the power of the mind is key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having a goal and training for it is an &lt;strong&gt;excellent&lt;/strong&gt; way to lose weight. I was not even looking to do it, but it just happens!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t know if running adds years to your life, but it definitely adds life to your years. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-244--12968-6-1X2X3X4X5-6,00.html&quot;&gt;Runner’s World Article (Page 6)&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Running, amazingly enough, can be enjoyable. (It can also be torturous!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It is definitely nice finding out that I am not dependent on my car. I can in fact go to the supermarket or the bank without it, if I so desire. This week I will also see what it feels like to commute from work to home using my running shoes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am not nearly done yet. I will not be until I cross that glorious finish line. However I can say that I am registered. And that is either a cause for me to commend myself or ask what in the world have I gotten myself into.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Middle Names</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/middle-names/"/> <updated>2009-03-25T01:10:32-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/middle-names</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We use names in order to identify people. Names are different according to our culture. Sometimes the family name is given more weight. Other cultures will have names that have a much stronger tie to what the person is like (e.g., Dashing Wind). And I am sure that there are many other uses for names that I don’t know about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here in America people often have middle names. We especially like to use the middle initial in order to make our name more unique. But our middle name is usually kept to ourselves. Or perhaps it’s just left to those times when our parents are exceptionally angry with us. There’s nothing like having your full name yelled to let you know that it’s time to do something right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case I have found myself over the years enjoying learning what people’s middle names are. After thinking about why this might be so, I have realized that it’s probably because it usually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; secret. I like knowing secrets. Doesn’t everyone? Middle names in particular make me feel that I am getting the chance to know people better because I have discovered something that so many other people don’t even take the time to find out. It creates an instant connection with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To top it all off, middle names can often be unique. And that can lead to amusing situations, indeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Middle names win. Sharing is caring.

It makes me more appreciative of what I have, and I don’t think that’s a bad thing at all. A while back, I was thinking about how great the yellow light is. For me, more often than not it’s a sign that says, “figure out if you can make this light!” Sometimes this is a resounding yes, and sometimes it’s a resounding no. Sometimes it’s even “you better get going pronto!” Can you imagine, though, what it would be like without yellow lights? Drivers would be moseying along thinking that they’re good to go, when all of a sudden they need to slam on their brakes. Accidents would abound because brakes cannot stop you instantly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently, I even got to experience a similar kind of fun. Many of the lights along a street that I commute on were out. So as expected all of the cars treated each malfunctioning light as an all-way stop intersection. And that wrecked havoc on my commute. Boy am I glad for signals!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, this reminded me of a problem that I am dealing with at work. The problem is that I am trying to make a single database access for every single object that I want to create. That would be analogous to a stop sign which lets everyone through one at a time. Ideally I am trying to code things that will allow for multiple objects with a single database connection. This would be with the lights that let multiple cars through.

Unless you’re Paris Hilton or some other well-heeled person (perhaps even if you are), you will come across things that need to be done. You will see dishes in the sink, clutter on the table, or tasks that need to be accomplished at work, and trash that needs to be picked up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past I have had the conscious thought that I want to be that person who will do what needs to be done. So I work at it. I am by no means great at it. In fact, I am probably not even that good at it. But I can see where I want to be. I want to be the person doing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there are so many people who do not even care. People will say that it is not in their job description or figure that someone else is going to do it. At times there are even people who do not see the things that need to be done because they are so intent on caring about themselves. How revealing!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you think that doing what needs to get done is natural? Today you can choose whether you want to be someone who gets it done or someone who cannot conceive of doing more than what is required.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Having The Desire</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/having-the-desire/"/> <updated>2009-03-04T00:14:18-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/having-the-desire</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nobody will go through life without changing. Sometimes that will be a physical change (e.g., exercising more) while other times it will be a character change (e.g., keeping secrets better). Personally, I think that it’s great to want to change for the better once you realize that there’s something that needs to be changed. It shows that you don’t don’t think that you’re perfect. And nobody likes someone who thinks that they’re perfect!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What about when other people dictate how you should change? When you’re young, it’s fairly normal for your parents to tell you what to do. That’s what they do. They instruct you on what to do in life. Without them (or perhaps sadly even with them) you don’t learn about things like manners and a good work ethic. But even more than as a child, there are all kinds of times when people are trying to tell us what to do. There are policies in the workplace, subliminal messages in the media, and even some form of instructions in politics. Everyone is trying to say how we are to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than having people tell you how to be, I think that it’s supremely better to have the desire to change come from yourself. It is so difficult to cause someone to want to change. Take losing weight as an example. There are countless people (especially in the United States) that are obese. Do they wish that they were healthy? On some level I’m sure that they do. Unfortunately, that desire isn’t strong enough to enact actual change (otherwise they wouldn’t be in the state that they’re in). But someone who is motivated to change will get so much more done. The key for all of the obese in America is that they need to stoke that fire of desire. Nutritionists and health experts can only tell them so many times about portion control and exercise. If they don’t desire it for themselves, they won’t do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, okay. I must admit that I’ve been watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbc.com/The_Biggest_Loser/&quot;&gt;The Biggest Loser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That desire surpasses everything else in importance. Skill? Sure that helps. But I’ll take a hard, less skilled worker over a lazy skilled worker any day. Status? People who get caught up in status are too content with that status to really do anything. Opportunity? People who really want it will make their own opportunities. And they will keep on trying until it happens.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Jury Duty 2009</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/jury-duty-2009/"/> <updated>2009-02-25T18:19:24-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/jury-duty-2009</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another year, another jury duty completed.

I got my highest score ever in bowling recently. While playing a game in the midst of bowling all I could for $5, I accomplished a feat that I thought not possible. The bowling alley was old school, and we had to score our own games (it’s amazing how few people know how to score bowling without a computer). Still I think that the picture speaks for itself:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3253/3288294781_3f6118082e.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scored 205!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lest you think that I am amazing at bowling, the score that I got the previous game was 98 thank you very much. I must also say, though, that I didn’t bowl my own third frame. If I did, who knows what great and earth-shattering things might have happened!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, I got sore from bowling that much.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Who Knows My Name?</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/who-knows-my-name/"/> <updated>2009-02-18T00:10:43-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/who-knows-my-name</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I parked in the garage in a slightly different spot on President’s Day since it was rather empty. There were a number of spots open that usually are not available when I arrive at work because so many people got to sleep in. Anyways, so I park next to a wall, and what do I see? None other than my name (spelled like I spell it) written on the wall!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How freaky is that? Excuse me while I go find out if someone is stalking me. If that’s you, can you kindly let me know? Thanks a bunch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3289113526_144e9802d5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Someone knows me...&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>10th Amendment</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/10th-amendment/"/> <updated>2009-02-13T00:10:35-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/10th-amendment</id> <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the 10th amendment to the United States Constitution, which effectively limits the power that the central government has. Have we forgotten this? Whatever happened to letting states decide things for themselves? Or even more, giving the rights to the people (without having it become a law).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the cusp of the likely signing into law of the Economic Stimulus Plan by President Obama, I can’t help but wonder how we got to this place. This place is one where the federal government gets to control so much of such a wide variety of areas. Will spending more of (essentially) our money revive us? I have my doubts as that has been tried before by FDR’s administration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This whole administration change has been interesting while I’m reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/PuUYqb&quot;&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/a&gt; by Ayn Rand, who would likely say that what President Obama stands for some of the most ultimate in evil because he is taking from the competent and giving to the incompetent.*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tenthamendmentcenter.com/&quot;&gt;10th Amendment Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What can we do? Perhaps decentralize the government a bit, huh? Not only is the government fairly unable to spend all of that money in a wise way, but they (at least in my mind) are going against the founding documents that this country is based on. Pragmatists will argue that desperate times call for desperate measures, but ideals are not just nebulous vapor. They are the foundation. Don’t let the foundation rot just so that the roof has new shingles. You can imagine the effect or even perhaps read about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%207:24-27;&amp;amp;version=49;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;* - Amusingly, I say this as if I know Rand even though I’m only halfway through the novel. So if you know contrary please let me know but don’t spoil the novel for me!&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Marathon</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/marathon/"/> <updated>2009-02-03T00:08:46-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/marathon</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I finished the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/15/half-marathon/&quot;&gt;half marathon&lt;/a&gt; back in October. And at the time I said that I wanted to eventually build up and do a full marathon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well I started to train for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lamarathon.com/&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Marathon&lt;/a&gt;! I haven’t registered for it yet just in case something happens during my training until the price increase. (Amusingly it increases on April 1, 2009 since fools and marathons go hand in hand.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many out there (myself included sometimes) wonder why people do these types of things. For me, it’s just something that I think would be an excellent chance to do. I’m not getting any younger. It’s a physical challenge that is a great goal to use to stay in shape. And it could be full of all types of life lessons. In the Bible there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:6-8;&amp;amp;version=49;&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:28-31;&amp;amp;version=49;&quot;&gt;kinds&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012:1-2;&amp;amp;version=49;&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:24-26;&amp;amp;version=49;&quot;&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; to it, and I think that is because there is so much that we can learn from doing things like this. How will I truly understand illustrations that I have not participated in myself? Because as we all know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/01/experience-matters/&quot;&gt;experience matters&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What will I learn? Will I finish? How long will I take? Stay tuned for all of this and much much more! Perhaps I will blog more about training for the marathon than I did while I was training for the half marathon. Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Right Then Fast</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/right-then-fast/"/> <updated>2009-01-28T00:22:21-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/right-then-fast</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wanting to do something new is an excellent thing. It’s often worthy of admiration whether that means keeping a commitment or trying something new.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the new year has rolled around, there have inevitably been a slew of new resolutions that people have made. They want to be healthier, they want to be slimmer, they want to be more productive. Whatever the case is, they are trying to be better than their old selves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s made me think recently about two of the things that I do: programming working out (well a little anyways).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing that they have in common is that they need to be done right. What is right in a world of relative truths? Well, Reader, that is a good question. Right is correctness. It is the lack of error. It is proper form, and it is successful execution. It is, in fact, an absolute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As people are trying to exercise and get healthy, they’re trying to do it as quickly as possible. And often people will burn themselves out with all of the effort that they’re putting in. Combined with a poor view (e.g., the goal is not to be skinny, it is to be healthy) and inadequate preparation, this is a recipe for disaster. By the time that February rolls around, most of the new year’s resolutions have fallen by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no use in trying to do 50 pushups as fast as you can if your form is incorrect. And there’s no use in trying to optimize a portion of code when the entire thing doesn’t work to begin with. Get back to the basics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First do it right, then do it fast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=20&quot;&gt;Quality, Quantity Or A Fast Time On The Stopwatch&lt;/a&gt; - from the gym that brought you the cast of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/&quot;&gt;300&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=vpTAq4dnmuAC&amp;amp;pg=PA474&amp;amp;lpg=PA474&quot;&gt;Optimization&lt;/a&gt; from a book that I use (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/QOeOtF&quot;&gt;Python in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition (In a Nutshell (O’Reilly))&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Be Realistic</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/be-realistic/"/> <updated>2009-01-21T00:15:10-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/be-realistic</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;He isn’t all that, people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-py&quot; data-lang=&quot;py&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;2013-01-20&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;2009-01-20&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;crowd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;pomp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;circumstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BarackObama&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Jesus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;derek&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exclaims&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&#39;Amen to that&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;work&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BarackObama&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;crowd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;judges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Finishing Up</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/finishing-up/"/> <updated>2009-01-13T00:10:51-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/finishing-up</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not everyone watches television. And even more than that, not everyone watches the commercials. But recently there has been a commercial that contains the quote:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I finish things. That’s what I do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;-Clint Eastwood (from the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1205489/&quot;&gt;Gran Torino&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I initially started this post last week, I unfortunately didn’t finish it before Gran Torino actually released nation wide on 1/12/09. (How apropos!) The quote is still interesting, and Clint Eastwood is still going strong as he nears the cusp of 80 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I see it all of the time: a carton of milk with a little bit left, a football player getting his arms on a runner but unsuccessfully bringing him down, books on reading lists that never get crossed off, leftover food that eventually rots, a job abandoned before its time. All of these things are a task unfinished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyday we perform tasks, and everyday we make choices. The finish line was made not only to be reached for, it was made to be crossed. Do I sprint, walk, or limp at the end? Or worse yet, do I not even get to see the end?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not that I’m there, but oh that I would live so that when I look back I can see that I made choices for completion in the form of empty plates, finished projects, read books, and tackled runners.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nba.com/lakers/&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Lakers&lt;/a&gt; have been doing fairly well, and I must say that I’m happy about that. If you’re wondering, I’m not a band wagon fan unlike many other people in southern California!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, I stop and think about the marketing for the NBA. “I love this game”?? Yeah, I’m sure that they love it so much. But what if they weren’t getting paid millions of dollars to play it? What if they only made the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/012528.html&quot;&gt;average salary of an American in 2007&lt;/a&gt;, which is $50,233? Okay let’s be generous and just go with an even $100,000. I doubt that we would get the talent that we have now because people wouldn’t devote their entire lives to getting better at the sport. Parents would force their kids to go through endless numbers of camps and drills in order to just get that perfect arc on their shot. They definitely wouldn’t spend every moment of the day in a gym. Well at least not the majority of them. I’m sure that some of them would still work just as hard because they really do love the game. But I’m sure that some of them would have to pursue other more lucrative careers that they could be successful at (such as rapping or investment banking).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love the game? Yeah, not so much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How is it that we live in a world where the player of a game (which I admittedly enjoy watching and participating in) can make many many times the amount of money of someone who is saving lives as a fireman? Or putting their lives on the line as policemen. Or helping the downtrodden. Money sure isn’t a direct correlation to importance in the grand scheme of things, is it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How inequitable! But what else can I expect from a world tainted by sin? *[NBA]: National Basketball Association, I thought that I already said that!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Passage Of Time</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/passage-of-time/"/> <updated>2009-01-02T00:29:16-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/passage-of-time</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many are apt to do, I feel like thinking about time as the new year is changing over. It’s interesting how time passes. In some ways it passes so quickly and things are so different now compared to a year ago. And in others, it was only a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not just a year that changes things. Even a moment has the power to affect a life.

This can range anywhere from a fish emblem to the more clever slogans to mysterious symbols that are a little more difficult to deduce. While I probably like seeing their proclamations of faith more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/11/sell-your-porsche/&quot;&gt;other things&lt;/a&gt;, it can still lead to pretty interesting results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A little while back I saw a van in and around Los Angeles, CA with the slogan: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;God’s way is the best way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The van was for a company that cleaned carpets named Best Way Carpet Clean. In addition to the above slogan, they also had some fish stickers on their van. Oh and there was a website listed on the van, but it seemed to be out of commission when I tried to access it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, what is the real motivation for them to put that on their van? Seems to me that it is either because they hope:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It will get them business because people are Christian and they’ll trust another Christian&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Non-Christians will think that Christians are more trustworthy so they’ll be hired&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever the reason, it seems to me that unless they made a special deal with God to miraculously clean carpets for them, it doesn’t have too much of a place in that environment. Not on their work van. As it is, it just seems like a ploy to get more business and hence make more money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lesson is: be a Christian anywhere (even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/29/christian-rap/&quot;&gt;as a rapper&lt;/a&gt;), but don’t do it out of incorrect motives.

Let me say that the new Dashboard (the part that the site owner looks at) is pretty darn nice now. You can drag and drop things, and it has all kinds of AJAX goodness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I also had some difficulties while upgrading. Namely, I had to fiddle a bit to get everything working alright. I’d been using Brian’s Threaded Comments, and the move from that to the new baked-in threaded comments wasn’t too hard. I just needed to update my theme, which is thankfully a custom one that I wrote so I know the ins and outs of it. So I made a new comments page that looks fairly similar to what it looked like before. The threading was maintained on old posts, and I definitely count it a success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I realized today that my commenting isn’t working! While using Brian’s Threaded Comments, I had been using a custom comment posting page to hinder spam. However that meant that I wasn’t using the normal page. So when I switched to the normal page (wp-comment-post.php), it wasn’t working! I had to realize that the “Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by …” error was because I had some extra lines in the aforementioned comment posting page. Removed those, and all is well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if you tried to comment recently and that didn’t work for you, I apologize.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But now that I think that I’m all good, I can enjoy how nice this new version is. You won’t be able to tell because it looks the same to you, but if you’re thinking about blogging then consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt; (if you don’t have a server) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;Wordpress.org&lt;/a&gt; (if you do have your own server).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have no idea what I’m talking about, then good day to you, and I hope that you’re doing well. Cheer up, at least gas is approaching $1.50 per gallon (it was $1.66 at Costco when I got it this morning).&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Only In A Metal Box</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/only-in-a-metal-box/"/> <updated>2008-12-11T00:35:49-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/only-in-a-metal-box</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do you alter someone’s mood and behavior so that they become a monster?

Of course, most of us don’t want to be put into a box because we feel that it inhibits who we are. We don’t want others to define us. And that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I’m talking about a metal box. In fact it’s a metal box that rolls around.

It really is pretty shocking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you use the box, you will get to see how people love to do things for themselves. In particular, they like to cut in line. Can you imagine if they did that to you while waiting in line at the bank? Perhaps when the teller says, “Next,” they will jump the line and just go up. What kind of an uproar would that cause?

Yes yes, in life you might see dancing. Whether in the club or at an organized school dance or at a wedding or in your house, dancing has a way of getting to people. Some more than others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it just me or does it always seem like people like to develop into circles when they’re dancing in groups? And where there is a circle, there will eventually be someone in the mush pot. It also seems like there is a particular type of person that always ends up in the middle. Maybe they like the attention. Maybe they’re trying to impress a special someone. Or maybe they just love a little space while they’re busting their moves. Everyone who’s not in the circle? I think that they like the circles because they can be entertained without having to actually dance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Me? I say no to circles!

Somehow we have to learn things. Even when we are talented at something, we still need to actually learn it before our talent can manifest itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I was learning how to drive a manual transmission, I got to go out with other people as I learned the basics of how it worked. But trying things out every couple of weeks could only get me so far. It was only when I got my own vehicle and had the chance to go out by myself that I started to work things out. Sure I failed. Sometimes miserably so. I can still remember some of those violent stalls where it felt as if the automobile body was going to separate from the wheels. But eventually it came together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve learned that while it’s easy to dictate (or be dictated to), it’s much better to give people the opportunity to shine. In other words, teaching a man to fish means sometimes the man doesn’t catch a thing. But he will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or…he’ll starve. In which case, I don’t know because the illustration doesn’t really cover that scenario.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Unsightly Hair</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/unsightly-hair/"/> <updated>2008-11-06T00:10:00-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/unsightly-hair</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’ve all seen people that have more hair than others. There are some that also have hair where others might not have it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these follicles are not really something that we get to choose. Whether we like it or not, we have genes that entirely dictate such things as the color of our hair, our height, and where hair grows on our body. We can try to change these things through dye, clothing, and hair removal (or implantation). But in reality we are who we are made to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s sad that we judge people based on things that they cannot change. (This is in no way a political statement about homosexuality, even though it’s becoming apparent to me that it can be interpreted as such. Or maybe it’s just been on the mind with Proposition 8 in California. Anyways, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.narth.com/docs/istheregene.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for some truth about the “gay gene” research done by Dr. Dean Hamer. But I digress.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So people can’t control things like where their hair grows. How do we in society get so disgusted by it? I admit that I can/do as well. But it’s strange how we can make demeaning statements about things that are not determined by these people at all!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes society stinks. And for sure mobs of people are no good.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Christian Rap</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/christian-rap/"/> <updated>2008-10-29T01:30:39-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/christian-rap</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Music is a wonderful thing. Throughout the ages, it has been created and enjoyed by man. It has ranged from the beat of the drum to the clang of the cymbal to the strings of the violin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In and of itself, music is innocuous. It is the words, lyrics, and association that we attach to these series of notes that give them their meaning. That brings me to the point where I wonder at the derision of specific genres of music. While I’m not a fan of every type of music (hardcore rock comes to mind), I do wonder sometimes at the motivation that people have for judgment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve often heard both Christians and non-Christians deride so-called Christian rap (aka Gospel Rap, Holy Hip Hop, and so on and so on). Basically it’s music that identifies itself as hip hop with lyrics that could in someway be identified as Christian. It seems that people mock it because they think that the combination of a culture of sex, drugs, and money that is often associated with the hip hop culture cannot be combined with what they perceive as stodgy, conservative Christianity. Since they cannot go hand in hand, it’s worthy of derision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet I can pretty readily admit that I listen to and enjoy some of the music in this genre. While I’m most definitely a fan of a wide variety of music (classic pop, r&amp;amp;b;, show tunes, alternative, trance, and more), some of my favorite artists might very well be clumped into this group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why I enjoy Christian rap:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like-mindedness&lt;/strong&gt; - While a lot of the groups and artists that I listen to don’t constantly mention the name of Jesus Christ, I enjoy listening to them because I know that we come from the same place. We’re more alike than different because we are more fundamentally similar than to someone who does not share the faith.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lyrics&lt;/strong&gt; - Hardly anybody on the radio even has interesting lyrics. It’s the same old game of sex, money, and women. Soulja boy? Hardly stimulating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creativity&lt;/strong&gt; - So granted, I don’t listen to a lot of underground secular rappers. But in my experience it seems that Christian groups that I listen to are much more wiling to try new things than the factory-pressed tracks heard on the radio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping It Real&lt;/strong&gt; - This might seem extremely strange in a genre that many people think of as utterly fake, but I think that they’re being more real when they create their works. They’re using their entire being, from their background in the ‘hood all of the way to their conversion because of Christ. They’re not trying to hide these things, and I can respect that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I don’t enjoy ever single Christian rapper that I listen to. Far from it. But the same is true across the board for all musical genres. Personally I enjoy those Christian rappers that like to talk about life, just like how I like to talk about life here on this blog. But that is my own taste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though it’s been popular in society to mock the Jesus that I believe in (Jesus is my homeboy anyone?), I won’t be party to it. I rather wonder why people act that way. Is it because (in the case of Christians) they’re insecure about being so in-your-face about the faith? Or perhaps it’s because (in the case of non-Christians) they haven’t experienced the same change?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever it is, I might not ever know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to check out some free songs: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sphereofhiphop.com/mp3/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=13&amp;amp;Itemid=30&quot;&gt;List of free (and legal) Christian hip hop mp3s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of my favorites are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;4th Avenue Jones (which have disbanded)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;L.A.

I figured that a half marathon would be a good place to start off at since the most that I’d run previous to my training was a 10K.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So it’s done, now I just need to figure out when I want to spend $100 to run 26.2 miles.

Specifically I went to go get a Double Cream Blueberry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I was walking out of the house I made sure that I had enough money, and I also grabbed a handful of coins off of my bookcase because I was running low in my car. So I get to Marie Callender’s and order my pie. Since I had a tin (they require a 50 cent deposit on them to make sure that people bring ‘em back) the cost was $6.99. I looked in my wallet, and I saw that I had one each of $20, $10, $5, and $1 bills. Sweet! So I grabbed the $5 and the $1 bills and started rummaging in the handful of change that I grabbed out of my car as I was getting out. I saw that I had 3 quarters, 3 dimes, a nickel and 3 pennies. (On another note, is it sad that I still remember all of this a few days later?) Sweet again! I can make over 99 cents with the coins that I had so I didn’t have to get more change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cashier starts looking at the coins (understandable since she needs to count it out), and she starts to mildly protest. I wonder what’s up, and she asks me what “this” is? She’s holding up one of the quarters. And…it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_yuan&quot;&gt;Chinese coin&lt;/a&gt;. Oh my, I am slightly embarrassed. Then I realize that I’m going to have to take &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of the money back since I couldn’t make another 25 cents. Haha I felt pretty silly having to take it back and give over the $10 bill. Thankfully the cashier didn’t seem to mind too much. She did make a comment that it was Japanese or something, to which I mumbled, “Er yeah something like that.” I was too sheepish to correct her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The whole time after that I was thinking that she might have thought, “What is this Asian guy pulling here?” So Marie Callender’s cashier, if you’re reading this, it was an honest mistake. I wasn’t trying to cheat. It’s also kind of unrelated, but I’m really not that Asian that I usually carry around Asian currency with me.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Willing To Change</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/willing-to-change/"/> <updated>2008-10-08T01:15:39-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/willing-to-change</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise that you are not always correct. And this even though you probably think that you &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; always correct (as I talked about in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/&quot;&gt;Algorithm For Your Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you have a wrong opinion and are faced with facts, are you willing to alter your thoughts on the matter? It’d be hard to find someone that doesn’t think that sounds reasonable. But it might come as a surprise to you that I feel as if I see that people are not always so. But why?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that a large part of the difficulty is that changing is tough to do. It is a rather outright admission that you are wrong. Nobody wants to be wrong. It’s also admitting that you don’t know it all. And don’t we all wish that we could be a know it all?

Those who can’t – teach. -H.L. Mencken&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;An oft heard saying that strikes deep at the hearts of every teacher around. It’s not hard to find a pupil or person who is willing to use the saying for someone that they are forced to listen to. While I don’t often say it (seems rather blatantly disrespectful, wouldn’t you say?), sometimes I can see where the quote might have come from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you met people that freely give their opinion on anything that they encounter? Yeah that person is called a know-it-all. They’re a KIA. Without the 10 year/100,000 mile warranty. Hardy har har. But they really are a pet peeve of mine. Most people aren’t fond of KIAs however when I encounter one I have this immense urge to prove them wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KIAs are a proud and arrogant bunch who at their core probably are a little unsure of themselves. And thus the need to prove their superiority over everyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to make the distinction at this point between those that think that they know it all as opposed to those that actually do know quite a bit. KIAs are those that think that they know it all. But they don’t. While they have an opinion on everything, you only need to be well-versed in one of the things that they talk about to know that they don’t know as much as it might seem. However, there really are people that know their stuff. And to them I say bravo. It’s funny how those that actually know a lot seem to think that they know so little while those that know very little seem to feign knowing much, huh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, so that point is that I don’t like listening to people give me their opinion on something that I’m doing when they have no experience in the matter themselves. If they have no experience, then they obviously do not entirely know what they are talking about. It’s even worse when I know that they don’t even have the capacity for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take exercising for example. While I’m not an amazing athlete or anything, it’s hard to listen to those who’ve never run a mile give their advice on my running. To someone who will not even raise a finger for their own well-being, you do not get to sit on the sideline and critique my effort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I give brownie points for trying your best. Perseverance is not something to be taken lightly. But if you’re not even willing to give it a shot? You might as well be talking to a wall. At least it won’t try to prove you wrong!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Mementos</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/mementos/"/> <updated>2008-09-24T01:20:18-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/mementos</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the journey of life, we have our ups and we have our downs.

While that doesn’t mean that they were any less impressive, it does mean that they didn’t get to be the first in their respective areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But many people are not satisfied to simply be doing something that has already been done. They want to be first. So they make claims that mean nothing. They state that they’ve invented the wheel without realizing that history says differently. They’re either &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/08/06/ignorance-bliss/&quot;&gt;blissfully ignorant&lt;/a&gt; or possibly a little more nefarious than that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This strikes deeper than simply attaining to some unknown peak. While for some people it might just be reaching for great things, it seems like those that make claims of “revolutionizing” something are just stuck in a world without the wild west to explore. They’re inventing frontiers where there is already a well-worn road. And they’re doing it because they can’t stand the thought of not doing something worthwhile in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to be a standout somehow. And you can.

There was steady progress until he was about 80% done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He continued to work on it (because as you well know 80% is getting pretty close to 100%). However, with new changes, he kept discovering that more work needed to be done. He would have to go back over his code to change things that he thought that he had previously addressed. The thing was, the further along he got, the more he discovered that he wasn’t nearly as close as he thought. So while he got further along, the end remained elusively close and yet not quite close enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While he was talking about the difficulties of the complete software development process, I also feel like the same troubles can affect me. (Haha and sometimes it happens to me in the software development process.) I make strides when there is much to be done. But then things start getting down near the end. I can see the end. Or at least I think that I can. But things keep popping up that keep me from getting there. Things will get done, but for some reason it feels like I’m going nowhere fast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From experience I’ve realized that I have to keep churning away at it until I’ve gotten there. When you’re climbing the hill, the end has to be the toughest (I mean, you’ve already spent all of that energy getting to where you’re at). But that triumphant moment when you get there, that’s worth it. Or, at least it usually is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Notice: Don’t climb mountains that you’re physically incapable of completing. I am just making my small commentary on life. I am in no way, shape, or form responsible if you actually fall off the side of a mountain.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Inconsiderate Actions</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/inconsiderate-actions/"/> <updated>2008-08-27T01:10:12-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/inconsiderate-actions</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else wish that people thought about others more? I can’t stand it when people think that their actions have no consequences for other people!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes people will do horrible and disgusting things. Sometimes they’ll even admit that it’s wrong. Sometimes, though, it goes beyond reason when they do horrible things, and justify themselves to others with the opinion that it won’t affect other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spit out your gum? Yeah, it’ll get on people’s shoes (or even my car!). That is not a happy moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throw your trash onto the street? Someone has to pick it up, and it most likely is not going to be your mother. It’s going to be some poor soul who has to clean up your mess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These things?

I know that I value this in myself and in others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While some think that fellowship and community are important, it seems to me that there is a distinctly positive association with being able to think and act of one’s own accord. In the workplace, this is obviously true because any employer would want someone who can figure out what’s wrong and solve something on their own without their manager’s every guiding instruction. But even outside of the workplace people like to see people who will help without being asked, not have to be told what to do every step of the way, and can come up with new ideas on their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps in this Randian society where man is elevated to the heroic nature that he is, we have gone even further such that our value system has become more sharply focused. That is, instead of praising society, we praise the individual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a Christian, though, I shouldn’t have such a high regard for the things that each of us can do on our own. I should feel indebted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christianity, at its roots, holds the message that we have something that we have done zero work for. The work that Jesus Christ did on the cross has made my sin null and void. And that is a wonderful thing! So while I can still appreciate independence in action, I need to always remember that ultimately I cannot hold it against others when they do not. For what do I hold over them? Nothing. I should forgive my debts, for I am forgiven mine.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Confusing Addresses</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/confusing-addresses/"/> <updated>2008-08-13T01:20:06-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/confusing-addresses</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For those that have ever driven in areas that are unfamiliar, I’m sure that you can sympathize with my distaste for confusing addresses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing is, it’s so unnecessary! Why must city planners do things like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Same name but differing suffixes (e.g., Boulevard, Street, and Circle)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Same number for multiple prefixes (e.g., 111 North Main St and 111 South Main St)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Non-numerical order. This can happen sometimes when changing cities. And it’s no good!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Non-standard street behavior. I’m talking about the one way street, the blocking island in the road that restricts cars from entering roads from certain directions, or even a strange break in the road!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buildings where you can’t see the address numbers! Alright so maybe it’s more the fault of the builders of each building. But still, it’s annoying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am Derek, therefore I rant. Haha. So will city planners listen? Doubtful, indeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously my deal with it is that I don’t like getting lost.

Bliss</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/ignorance-bliss/"/> <updated>2008-08-06T01:20:07-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/ignorance-bliss</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People sure seem to like to talk about themselves being ignorant. But just go and call someone ignorant and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve heard it said that being called ignorant is tops for bad things to be called. Now whether that is a true statement remains to be seen. Still it makes me wonder. Is the saying true? Is ignorance bliss?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When people talk about ignorance as a blissful state, they are usually talking about the fact that they are unaware of something. Perhaps it’s because they’ve been caught doing something that they’re not supposed to be doing (e.g., breaking the law because they didn’t know the law). Or perhaps it’s because it’s their last resort reasoning for why they aren’t caught up on the facts (e.g., people not up on things like politics).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t seem altogether like I have to buy ignorance as an excuse. Do I really care if someone didn’t know that it was illegal to yield to me at a signal when they’ve just caused an accident? No, frankly ignorance as an excuse is useless. Facts are facts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So is it bliss? Maybe. But it sure is an extraordinarily weak argument/excuse/cop-out no matter why you’re saying it.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Driving ~ Playing The Stock Market</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/driving-playing-the-stock-market/"/> <updated>2008-07-31T01:15:09-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/driving-playing-the-stock-market</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lots of people drive. Although perhaps we should rethink the way that we do it, what with the amount of money we’re sinking into our traveling. While there is much to think about (least of all are my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/07/16/tips-for-saving-gas/&quot;&gt;Tips For Saving Gas&lt;/a&gt;), you can also find lessons that aren’t initially obvious. And by you, I mean me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Driving everyday to work has taught me a few things. One thing that I’ve recently noticed is how it seems to me that I need to just chill when I’m driving. That is, it does no good to constantly switch lanes in order to try to get ahead. While I may get ahead a little bit, just a single wrong choice, and I’ve lost all that I’ve worked so hard to get.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So it is with stocks as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fairly common advice is that you should buy for the long term. The extra stress, work, and volatility are said to just not be worth it. That is, you could do all of that work and still end up at the same place as someone who just set it and left it. And that definitely happens to people when they’re switching lanes trying to get around all of the other people. It’s perhaps even more noticeable since a good deal of the road that I drive is 2 lanes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t be shocked if something abruptly happens to you. If you’re going someplace and you need to be on time, isn’t it always better to be early and prepared rather than cutting it as close as possible? That way, if something happens, you’ll have some leeway to recover. And don’t you dare go putting all over your money into 1 stock. Or even all of your money into stocks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notice patterns. When driving the same route everyday, I start to get a sense of how things are. That is, some lanes are more apt to progress more quickly because of the traffic flow. And I start to notice how lights are set up so I know whether it’s worth it to bust my butt to make the light. Alright so maybe that’s hard to make into some lesson for stocks because the whole deal with the stock market is that people are trying to predict what companies are going to do. And it’s only partially based on past performance. Still, take that past into account when doing your stock-picking thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The comparison doesn’t hold up completely, of course. While you don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to buy stocks, you do have to pick a lane to drive in. But you know what? I’m not concerning myself with making a perfect comparison.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Relationship Games</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/relationship-games/"/> <updated>2008-07-23T01:09:58-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/relationship-games</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An easy way to differentiate between people that are young and old are how they deal with relationships.

They play games. What are games?

And if the goal of relationships is marriage, then how is that helpful in accomplishing that goal? It’s not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guys need to ask the girl out, straight up. (I had my fun being sarcastic about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/06/04/on-asking-a-girl-out/&quot;&gt;On Asking A Girl Out&lt;/a&gt; by saying what you should &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be doing.) But you need to make it crystal clear to her what you want and what you’re doing. Otherwise you’re just beating around the bush and wasting everyone’s time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Girls need to act purposefully. You want him? Go with it if he asks you out. You don’t? Tell him the truth, brutal as it might be. Don’t sugarcoat things because that helps nobody.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These things don’t just apply to the chase, do they? I’m not even really sure why they would apply more specifically to guy/girl relationships. All I know is that I see it there more often.

And while I am not ever going to be a hyper-miler, I can at least do as well as I can. (It’s hard to get superb gas mileage when you drive a truck.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I do drive a less than ideal automobile, I am still able to get 20 MPG. And that might not sound too impressive to most people, but for trucks that’s not bad. But besides that, the tips are still good. They’re by no means new, though. But I didn’t just read it on some other site and paste them here. And remember, sometimes it’s just fine to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/07/02/coming-up-with-it-yourself/&quot;&gt;Coming Up With It Yourself&lt;/a&gt;. [caption id=”” align=”alignright” width=”240” caption=”Courtesy of Flickr user Cobalt123”]&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/people/cobalt/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3295/2673768684_bfbb573238_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Courtesy of Flickr user Cobalt123&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimize Braking&lt;/strong&gt; - This is of the utmost concern. Some of the other tips could also be generalized to this. Why is braking bad? Well every moment of braking is a moment where energy that was expended by gas is being needlessly lost. That is, you get the most use out of your gas when you’re not braking at all because all of the energy from the gas is being used to power the vehicle. And while this is not feasible with the traffic laws that we have, it’s still a true fact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coast Into Red Lights&lt;/strong&gt; - When you see a red light up ahead, don’t continue with your foot on the accelerator! Why are you in a rush to sit at a red light? Instead, take it easy on the accelerator and ride out your momentum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruise Control Is Your Friend&lt;/strong&gt; - For periods of driving that are going to be stop-free, utilize that cruise control. The car will consistently apply gas to continue at the speed that the cruise control is set at. And the car will probably do it better than your attempts at keeping your foot steady.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coast Down Hills&lt;/strong&gt; - Gravity will accelerate your vehicle down the hill. So put your transmission into neutral (this is more normal with a manual transmission) and let gravity work its magic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn Off The Car&lt;/strong&gt; - Instead of idling, turn the car off when you know that you’re going to be sitting for awhile. While most modern cars are not built to constantly be turned on and off (like at every red light), it’s probably best to turn it off if you’re waiting for someone to run into the store.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proper Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s hard to do your best when your vehicle isn’t up to snuff. So keep up with those oil changes, regularly inflate those tires, and make sure everything is as the manufacturer intended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow Down&lt;/strong&gt; - Probably one of the most important, this has numerous benefits besides gas savings including (but not limited to) overall safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;These seem simple enough. An added bonus for doing all of this is decreased road rage. You’ll care more about what’s going on with you and your vehicle than you will about how that jerk cut you off.

I mean, even besides the things that humanity doesn’t know (e.g. the cure to any of a whole slew of diseases, the details of all of the other planets and galaxies, where Amelia Earhart is), there are things that you just don’t know like how to program a complex program, how DNA works, how to create a bookcase from a tree, how to cook a perfect turkey for Thanksgiving, and the list goes on endlessly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So in life, we’re always learning. You’ve probably heard that it’s pretty good for you to learn something new everyday. And I concur, that’s a great thing. Having an open mind, being amazed, willing to be taught. It’s all swell!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m interested, though, in how there are differences to learning. There is the kind that we learn because someone has taught us (i.e. in the classroom setting at school), but there is also the learning that comes out of a totally different intelligence/mind set. While the former is good, I’m apt to think that the latter is even better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Newton, Socrates, Einstein among a few all had to come up with things on their own. They used logic, research, and intuition to arrive at the results that we now know all about today. And while there are many things that have been figured out already, it’s still pretty good for someone to separately arrive at the correct solution without having been taught it explicitly. At least I think so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So do you know anyone that solved the Rubik’s cube without looking at the answer? Yeah me neither.

And thankfully I enjoy it (well at least most of the time). Geeky as it sounds, I’ve also found that I kind of like to occasionally participate in programming contests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I participated in the last Google Code Jam in 2006, but I didn’t fare all that well. Of course, that might also be because I decided to open up the problem and then go eat lunch after reading through it. And did I mention that I only got an hour to work on it once I opened it? I could have at least solved that problem! I only needed 5 more minutes! Although, I’m pretty sure that I wouldn’t have solved another so I still wouldn’t have done very well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, to make a long story short, I enjoy programming. And programming contests like this can be fun! I’m currently trying out some of their practice problems, and I’m going to go with Python as my language of choice (last time I went with C++).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t particularly have high hopes for how well I can do, but it’s still fun to try! It’s free, and fun (for some people).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/codejam/&quot;&gt;Google Code Jam&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update: I suck! I solved one problem’s (Train Schedule) small input, but I couldn’t quite get another problem (Saving the Universe) to work correctly. However since they don’t test the large input until the end, I found out that my large didn’t pass! And that means that I do not move out of the qualification.

No matter where we go, no matter how high we fly, awkwardness will never leave us! Oh hooray!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than that, it seems like things are getting worse. What with the age of the computer upon us, our social interactions are changing rather dramatically pretty quickly. Children, instead of playing with the other neighborhood kids, will play games online with strangers they’ve never actually met. And while I am not opposed to playing games (I’ve played a game or two myself), you must admit that it is changing things up. Instead of being active, we’re watching more television. The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even beyond childhood, we are maintaining our relationships through this newfangled phenomenon called the Internet. On websites for all sorts of topics and aims, we are interacting with people in a whole new way. We consider people that we’ve never met in real life our friends. We spend countless hours writing on blogs (kind of like this one!). You get the point. I don’t think that these things are bad in and of themselves, they are bringing our society to a place where social skills are declining.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a related but slightly different note, is it just me or has the word awkward encroached everyday conversation over the past few years? And somehow, I don’t think that helps fight against the awkwardness. While it does seem amusing at times, I’ve grown to dislike it quite wholeheartedly. Perhaps it’s because any amusement is always coming at someone’s expense. Someone who usually cannot afford to be laughed at. Or maybe it’s because I’d much prefer if everyone were comfortable instead. Whatever the reason, awkwardness is no good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or am I the only one?&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Difference Between Childish And Child-Like</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/difference-between-childish-and-child-like/"/> <updated>2008-06-18T01:12:01-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/difference-between-childish-and-child-like</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I, for one, am very amused by children. Of course, I’m also amused by a lot of other things. So I guess simply because I’m amused by something doesn’t make it noteworthy. And yet here I go writing about what I’m amused by.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;child-like&quot;&gt;Child-Like&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3077/2588771033_77f03b9201_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;child-like&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/people/kristi-san/&quot;&gt;Kristi-san&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With children, I think that I can break down my amusement to the fact that they are new to the world. They haven’t lived in society for the years and years that adults have. (Of course, that relates to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/06/11/oh-youre-wrong-it-manners/#comment-14747&quot;&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt; on a previous post.) So for lack of all of those years of social influence, they are new to the world. They aren’t jaded because everything is fresh. The ocean is huge, the mountains so tall, and everything is worthy of a question. And in addition to that, they are much more free about doing and saying things. That is, they aren’t inhibited because they don’t even know that they should be inhibited. So they’ll run and have fun, pick their nose when they feel a booger, and say what they think about people. Even when it’s inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I’m amused by all of this, it’s also likely because I don’t have to deal with my own children. Because…I don’t have any. Yet. Haha but really I’m positive that it can get old to parents when their kid(s) are acting up endlessly. Oh boy I can’t even imagine!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3134/2588771103_dc3d32bf09_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;childish&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/people/63031528@N00/&quot;&gt;blondie478&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;childish&quot;&gt;Childish&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;And while I enjoy this child-like charm, (as the title suggests) I don’t actually like it when people are acting childish. What’s the difference? Well in my terms, childish usually applies to those traits of children that are very undesirable. I think of things like throwing temper tantrums, being self-centered, not knowing when to be serious, and other such pleasant attributes. And while children obviously do this, I think that I’m even more turned off when I see it in people that should know better: adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In them, I find it to be such a turn-off. And I’m not just talking about in girls. When I meet a guy that acts childish, I’m almost immediately turned off to ever wanting to be friends with him. Childishness just shows (to me) a lack of maturity that is more and more exaggerated the more I’d expect them to be mature. They say that with age comes wisdom, but that, unfortunately, isn’t true for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So it all comes down to this: I want to continually be child-like and grow to never be childish!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Oh You're Wrong, It Manners</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/oh-youre-wrong-it-manners/"/> <updated>2008-06-11T01:18:50-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/oh-youre-wrong-it-manners</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever eat or hang out with someone who has bad manners? Ever even notice?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have, and I’m sure that I will. But really I wonder about myself sometimes. That is, I will often wonder whether I am that person. Am I the one eating too much? Am I the one who acts like a slob? Am I the one doing something that everyone else talks about behind my back?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes manners are a social construct that simply ensures that there are people who can look down on others that don’t know the rules. As if life is a big game where someone always has to win. So on the one hand I don’t want to mind them because there is no absolute reality to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, while I am a part of society, society is also a part of me. I’ve seen people without manners, and let me tell you, it isn’t a pretty sight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I’ll do what I can and hope that I am not ever &lt;em&gt;that guy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>On Asking A Girl Out</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/on-asking-a-girl-out/"/> <updated>2008-06-04T01:25:47-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/on-asking-a-girl-out</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dating is a frightening proposition. I thought I’d put together some pointers for those guys who might be thinking about venturing out into the big blue sea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scared&lt;/strong&gt; - That’s right, girls are scary. They’re mean. They’re intimidating. So shy away from them. Ask them out using as little direct interaction as possible (e.g. while chatting online, on their Facebook, over e-mail). They’ll just want to coddle and love you because they can see that you’re a sensitive soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask Everyone For Advice&lt;/strong&gt; - Communal knowledge, right? Ask her friends, her enemies, your friends, your enemies, strangers, and anyone else what you should do before you actually do it. But no matter what, don’t ask her yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nervous&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s not easy. So go ahead and stutter, stumble over your words, and forget what you wanted to say. She’ll understand. It’s a tough, cold world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over Dramatize&lt;/strong&gt; - Asking out a girl is a big deal. So go all out. Flowers? Of course. Dress up? Sure. Jewelry? Perhaps. Because really, once she says yes to a date, she’s probably going to say yes to anything else that you ask.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick Her&lt;/strong&gt; - Don’t even call it a date. Call it “hanging out” or “catching up” or something similarly ambiguous. That way you can get in under the radar without having to put yourself out there. Because if you put yourself out there, you might get hurt. And that doesn’t feel good!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure Out Everying Before&lt;/strong&gt; - She’s gonna say yes anyways. So you have to know what kind of centerpieces you’re going to have at your banquet. Man she’s going to look beautiful walking down that aisle towards you, huh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Take No For An Answer&lt;/strong&gt; - She really wants you. She’s just playing hard to get. Go get ‘em, Tiger. Even if she gets a restraining order. Even if she never responds to you. Even if she says to get out of her life and never call her again. It’s all a ploy. Only suckers fall for ploys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now you’re ready, young man. Or old man. Whatever stage of life you are man. You have all of the tools necessary to win the woman of your dreams. Don’t worry, she’s gonna love you. Trust me, I can tell about these kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Neighborhood Dogs</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/neighborhood-dogs/"/> <updated>2008-05-28T01:10:13-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/neighborhood-dogs</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Say you’re taking a nice afternoon run.

We have them about all kinds of things. Sometimes we base them on our experiences, but more often we seem to base them on our hopes and dreams. We can have them about things like birthdays, get-togethers, and other events. In our mind’s eye we see people being caring and loving, friendly and jolly. It’s not always so, is it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But besides that, we can even have expectations about much more concrete matters. When we sit in the chair, we have that dreamy expectation that the chair will hold up our weight. If that expectation isn’t met, we sure aren’t too happy! And so it goes moment by moment with all sorts of things that we encounter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More recently I’ve noticed how much people do this with things that they don’t understand. Or rather, I’ve noticed how this comes into play when people are dealing with those things that most of us do not fully understand. Things like televisions, computer programs, and automobiles will all sorely disappoint us when we expect them to work and they do not. But when we don’t know what to expect, and things work how happy are we?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we try out a shortcut key and find that some programmer has made sure that shortcut key works aren’t we pleasantly surprised? Or when we go to a website, make a guess at what to do, aren’t we glad for whoever made it work just so?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I emphasize the computer software, but it’s obviously more.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Group Friendship</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/group-friendship/"/> <updated>2008-05-15T01:20:27-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/group-friendship</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I think of friendship, I initially think of a relationship between one person and another. They can be all sorts of combination of guys and girls (okay so really there are only 4 combinations if there are 2 people involved). But have you noticed how different everything is when a group is involved?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine, if you will, going into a situation where you’re trying to get in with a whole group of people. Individually you are able to interact pretty well with them. Conversation is pretty easy, common ground is found, life is good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as a whole when you’re with them things are not well. You are left standing there thinking, “What am I doing here?” You don’t follow their inside jokes. And you definitely haven’t known them for as long as they have known each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why the difference? It seems strange to me to be able to be friends with them individually but have trouble with them when they are all a group. But it happens. Related to mob mentality?

It’s an interesting (and kind) thing to say. Often it’s the guy talking about his wife, but not always so. It’s slightly demeaning towards the “lesser half” (often self-deprecating since that person will say it about themselves) but that’s supposed to be hidden by the elevation of the spouse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So my question is, how can both of them be the better half? I really don’t think that can be the case. I had a talk quite sometime back about this. We talked about different couples that we know, and sad as it was we realized that we could usually think of one person in the relationship who was a better catch. We weren’t trying to be mean (at least I don’t remember that being the intention, I think it was just a commentary on things that we saw). Still, it’s an interesting thought huh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think of a couple, and I’d hazard a guess that you could think that one of them is a bit of a better catch than the other. Now why this might be will obviously change from case to case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why did I write this? I don’t know, I just thought about it all of a sudden. And I thought it was an interesting thought. Don’t read into it too much or your head will hurt. And nobody likes headaches. Nobody. But do appreciate your other half for &lt;del&gt;what&lt;/del&gt; who they are!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>I Don't Follow Celebrities' Lives</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/i-dont-follow-celebrities-lives/"/> <updated>2008-04-30T01:15:31-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/i-dont-follow-celebrities-lives</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How many people do you know who are more interested and involved in the lives of celebrities than in the lives of those around them? Too many? Yeah, me too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;who-are-they&quot;&gt;Who Are They?&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the realm of entertainment, there are actors, musicians, athletes, and people who are nothing else except somehow rich. They all come together at events, walk around the same streets that we do, and have lives that occasionally defy soap operas in their outrageousness. But why are there people who don’t personally know the celebrities interested in them at all? Is it because they seem to belong to a higher social caste than we? Is it because they are prettier, richer, and more talented than us? Is it because they do things that we wouldn’t even dream of doing?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;my-thoughts&quot;&gt;My Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Really I just don’t know why us common folk are interested in them. All I know is that I see people all over the place who are far more interested in celebrities (who they do not know) than in their friends and family (who they do know). Something doesn’t seem right about that does it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really don’t think that celebrities are that interesting. I respect their talent, and I’m definitely not opposed to entertainment. But I don’t care what kind of a drink they ordered at Starbucks last Wednesday or who was seen schmoozing with who at the hot club in Las Vegas. Nor do I care to use any of my brain to remember any other unnecessarily small fact about them. What kind of a world do we live in where we know the favorite candy of a star and don’t even know what is really going on with the guy right next to us?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s time to stop immersing ourselves in others’ lives and time to start living our own!

Pirates, though? Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not the pirates that say, “Arggh me matey” or have a peg leg or even have a parrot on their shoulder. That would be cool, but I actually only know pirates in the modern day sense. You know the ones that illegally consume things like music, videos, software, pictures, or any of a whole range of things. Haha I can hear the groans already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The digital age has made it infinitely more easy to exactly duplicate other content (which is related to why digital things are superior in quality to analog). With this, people have degenerated to outright stealing while not even understanding what they’re doing. Well I hate to break it to you, but wrongs committed unintentionally are still wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I have written that I think that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/14/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid/&quot;&gt;Music Piracy Makes People Stupid&lt;/a&gt;, this issue is far larger than just music. Music is the best known, probably because it’s the area that’s most often violated. It is so much more widespread, though. So let’s get down to the real issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;breaking-down-piracy&quot;&gt;Breaking Down Piracy&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone creates something for a purpose&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somehow it’s made available to other people (whether stolen, hacked, copied, or what) outside of the realm of the original purpose&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You (or a “friend” of yours) gets a copy of said good and utilize it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is that pretty much how it breaks down? Seems to me like the real issue is that the creator/writer/actor/musician/whatever did not intend for those in step 3 to make use of their creation. If I were a computer programmer and wrote a program to sell. And then if someone had illegally hacked my program that I worked to create to sell and gave it away for free, I’d be piping mad. If you were a photographer and had taken a picture for someone, but someone else had taken it and used it for a totally different purpose, you’d be up in arms. If you provided services (law, medicine, therapy, teaching, what have you) and someone took your service without providing payment, you’d see that something was immediately wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So basically, since the creator didn’t want it (and who hopefully created a bulletproof license or end user agreement), you’re undermining what they’re doing. It doesn’t matter that you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; create a digital copy of their song without paying for it and they’ll be none the wiser. Because in actuality, it does affect them. You &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have paid them for that song. And you are now a pirate. But you don’t have to be!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;dealing-with-this-new-ninja-world&quot;&gt;Dealing With This New Ninja World&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is all lost? Far from it. Once you understand what it’s like to be the one being defrauded, you’ll see that something needs to change. And there is a solution! There are all kinds of answers! Maybe watch things that are actually released by the studios (try out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hulu.com&quot;&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;), actually buy music (if you’re listening to music you can probably afford to pay for it) or try &lt;a href=&quot;http://amiestreet.com/&quot;&gt;Amie Street&lt;/a&gt; for the whole indie scene, and possibly even catch up on some of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/13/favorite-open-source-apps/&quot;&gt;Favorite Open Source Apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or you could just become a real ninja and then you’d care about arrows, ninja stars, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninjato&quot;&gt;ninjato&lt;/a&gt; rather than swiping versions of old TV shows, Adobe Photoshop, and/or the remix version of Justin Timberlake’s latest single. :D&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>TiddlyWiki For The World!</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/tiddlywiki-for-the-world/"/> <updated>2008-04-15T01:10:26-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/tiddlywiki-for-the-world</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You might have heard of a wiki. Then again, you also might not have heard one it. It’s a method of displaying user-modifiable content. That is, it can be changed by the people looking at it. This is different than things like this blog where I and I alone get to write. The wiki has been gaining notoriety since it allows the collaboration of knowledge, especially over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The name wiki gets its name from Ward Cunningham, developer of the very first wiki. It’s actually Hawaiian in origin (wiki means fast), but you can read more about that at Wikipedia’s (appropriate since it’s one of the most well known wikis) &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki&quot;&gt;page on the wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-tiddlywiki&quot;&gt;The TiddlyWiki&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now that we’ve got the foundation knowledge in place, I wanted to share about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tiddlywiki.com&quot;&gt;TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt;. (It still strikes me as an amusing name.) It is touted as a personal non-linear personal web notebook. I like to think of it as a central place where you can store whatever you want. It’s pretty easy to use after some initial adjustment. It is a single html file just like any old webpage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To use it just open it up in any web browser, and you’re ready to go. Double-click on things to change them, and you can start creating new tiddlers (entries) and deleting ones that you don’t need. Saving your changes saves the information into that exact same html file. So all of the data &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the framework are contained within a single file. As long as you have a web browser, you can modify your file. And what computer out there doesn’t have some sort of a web browser nowadays?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This file is the perfect size for a portable usb drive. It starts off empty at about 250KB, but it doesn’t grow all that quickly since only the new text that is added is stored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The TiddlyWiki is a method that is open to different uses. And there are many.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;some-uses-for-tiddlywiki&quot;&gt;Some uses for TiddlyWiki&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Web Journal - save links and articles that you find online&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blog - extremely easy to write and publish (just put the html file on a web server and it’s published)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personal Journal - just have the file with you wherever you are, and it’ll be safe from prying eyes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Collaborate on projects - one person can write and the changes will be instantly available for anyone else to see&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many ways to store information. You could write it on paper, you could just remember everything, you could use a Microsoft Word document, whatever. So here are some reasons why you’d use a TiddlyWiki instead of one of those other methods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;advantages-of-tiddlywiki&quot;&gt;Advantages of TiddlyWiki&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basic tags (which allow you to quickly see all entries with a particular tag)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quick searching as you type into the search box&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Self-contained (it’s a single file)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Portable (I guess that’s always relative, but it’s small in size)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interactive feel&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;server-side-implementations&quot;&gt;Server-side Implementations&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personally I’ve been using a version of this that’s on my server. I tried a couple of different products, but MiniTiddlyServer (Update: MiniTiddlyServer is not deprecated so you will need to figure out another way) was the easiest and most straightforward for my PHP-enabled server. All I needed to do was download the zip file, put it onto my server, and off I went! Update: Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.goingthewongway.com/&quot;&gt;my own TiddlyWiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those without their own server, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tiddlyspot.com&quot;&gt;TiddlySpot&lt;/a&gt; seems like a reasonable free solution. *[html]: Hyper Text Markup Language *[usb]: Universal Serial Bus&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>200th Post</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/200th-post/"/> <updated>2008-04-09T01:10:31-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/200th-post</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So over a year after starting, I’m at 200 posts.

Sometimes we want to get older, and sometimes we will do everything that we can to reduce it. But we really have no control over it, do we?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems as if all of this starts early in life. As we are going through the different grades in school, there is a marked distinction between students who are in different grades. Granted, this is all rather necessary because children generally mature and progress according to how old they are. So it makes sense in that situation. But the lasting influence seems to be that we feel comfortable with &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; people our own age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This effect can often be seen in the arena of relationships. Why is it that many of my friends who are girls will not even think about dating a younger guy? Is it because younger guys is not be great and worthy of her? Is it because they (the girls) are somehow more mature because they are a couple of years (sometimes a couple of months) older? I doubt it. Why do my guy friends only look for girls that are younger than them? And why is there a floor limit such that they won’t even consider girls younger than their specified age? There are a lot of questions, and there aren’t that many answers. All I know is that it all doesn’t make much sense. People limit themselves by not looking for the things that really matter, the essence and characteristics of a person. Then they complain that they can’t find anyone. And that’s just not right, is it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;social-aspects&quot;&gt;Social Aspects&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;People age. That’s the truth. And it seems like as that happens the reality of death is more apparent. The chances become greater (on any particular day since the actual chances that you will die are 100%), and that seems to have lend itself to the general notion that young is better. Even more than that unspoken tendency is that socially we have come to praise the young as vibrant and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, people who are getting older can always attest that they are getting wiser. It’s true, they should be getting wiser anyways. They just have more experience, and those with experience know that it counts. Of course, those who lack it do not think that it counts for very much. I know, I’ve been/am still there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I say that it’s so much more important to be young at heart. Of people that I’ve met, young and old, I find myself consistently being convinced that being young at heart is truly the way that I want to go. I don’t want to lose the awe of a child looking at the huge expanse of the night sky or discovering something for the first time. No amount of time or social constructs can take &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; away. Whatever you do, don’t be proud of your age sheerly because of your age. That would make you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/01/13/proud-of-nothing/&quot;&gt;Proud Of Nothing&lt;/a&gt;, wouldn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So really there are 2 ways that you can deal with age:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wine&lt;/strong&gt; - get tastier and more valuable with age&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheese&lt;/strong&gt; - get moldy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Haha I know, I’m just good at making up strikingly accurate analogies.

And I must say, it was quite nice!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted to write this down partly for myself, just so that I can remember it all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Starting the day before the rehearsal some of the groomsmen hung out with Daniel, the groom. It wasn’t too outrageous at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then the day of the rehearsal (the day before the actual wedding) was quite busy. Rental car, drove up ~60 miles to the church (in LA) for the rehearsal. Got there in time (even with workday traffic). Fun rehearsal! For some reason it seemed pretty amusing. (Oh and I might have tested out the sanctuary to see how my laugh would echo. And other people might have told me to not dare laugh the day of the wedding. :P) Rehearsal lunch. Food was good, and the conversation was fairly flowing. Hotel. The hotel messed up. Unhappiness. Ah oh well. Go-karts. Better at it than I thought. (I guess that even though I can rant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/27/on-driving/&quot;&gt;On Driving&lt;/a&gt;, I might very well have an aggressive driver in me!) Got 2nd out of our group (thanks a lot Mike haha). Hm where is my trophy? Dinner with Daniel’s family. Late, but it worked out. Sat with some of his extended family and another groomsman. Got to hear about New Mexican food and their amazing miracle chili sauce. (I’ve never tried it, but I’d be very willing at this point!) Hotel. Get ready for sleep. Gifts from groom. Talk. Sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Up at 6:30 AM (it was a 10:30 AM wedding) to get ready. Out of the hotel by 8 AM. Do random stuff at the church and sit around looking good for a couple of hours. Walk down the aisle. Stand. Stand. Feet hurt. Stand. And done! Get out of there, help with more random stuff. Reception. Kiss kiss. See old friends from college. Nice. Good lunch. Real nice. Slideshow. Oh sweet they put me in it more than once. Drive back down to pick up my car from the groom’s place, and that’s a wrap!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoyed my time being a part of their wedding. I’m glad that I at least got to be in one! Haha I think that I’m probably good in terms of wedding experiences. That is I don’t need to be a part of another one. Except as groom. That’s one experience that I’m pretty positive that I want!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.micahgilmore.com/&quot;&gt;Micah Gilmore&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.micahgilmore.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; with:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;* [Wedding Day](http://weblog.xanga.com/micahs22action/647567516/staceydaniel.html) * [Rehearsal](http://weblog.xanga.com/micahs22action/647358369/a-quickie.html) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theimageisfound.com/&quot;&gt;The Image Is Found&lt;/a&gt; - the actual photographers.

I’ve often found it amusing for things like birthdays when people will say that they remembered, but they just didn’t say anything about it. Really…well that’s hard to imagine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing is, some people have better memories than others. Everyone is different and is able to remember things in different ways. Laugh if you must, but I remember wanting a photographic memory like Cam Jansen when I was a kid. Then I could rapidly flip through books and not need to study! How wonderful that would have been! But alas, my dreams did not come true. Even now I often wish for a better memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But just as remembering something is pretty binary (i.e. you did or you didn’t), those of us lacking in the memory department have to make do with what we have. Otherwise we will be mocked. Who will mock, I do not know. All I know is that mocking will occur.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;memory-aids-that-i-use&quot;&gt;3 Memory Aids That I Use:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;remember-the-milk&quot;&gt;Remember The Milk&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;(RTM for short)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides having a pretty amusing name, this is a website whose sole purpose is to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_%28computer_programming%29#Tags&quot;&gt;TODO&lt;/a&gt; lists. It’s refreshing for a website to be so singular in its purpose in this day of do-everything-until-we-take-over-your-life websites. In any case, I initially signed up for an account on the site, thought it was cool, and promptly did not hardly ever use it because visiting another site everyday wasn’t too practical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then they developed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/firefox&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; extension that changed that up! They developed an extension for placing an RTM pane whenever a Gmail tab is opened! It maintains the overall look and feel of gmail so you (or at least I) don’t feel like it’s out of place at all. Since I much more often have a browser tab open for Gmail, I was much more able to use the service. And I have. And it’s great!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The concept is nothing new, you just put in due dates. But since it’s in front of my face at least once a day (since I check my e-mail once a day), it’s actually useful. And it’s on a remote server so I don’t need to worry about losing it or keeping different lists in sync.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So there are 2 ways to use this baby:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;* [Gmail for RTM extension](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/gmail/) * [RTM website](http://www.rememberthemilk.com) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Either will do, just do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;phone-calendar&quot;&gt;Phone calendar&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay so I don’t have a smart phone. But that doesn’t mean that my phone is dumb! (Ha…ha…)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But almost all phones nowadays have some sort of calendar feature. And that’s fine and dandy for checking what the date is. But there is often also the ability to schedule events. So I use my phone (a Motorola, by the way) and put in reminders for certain things that I need to get done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is especially useful when I’m out and about. Often my phone is one of the few things that I’ll carry with me. I could actually text message a reminder to RTM which is cool. But I’ll be honest, I’m cheap when it comes to text messaging. And Verizon charges $.15 per message. For the amount of reminders that I put in for myself, that could get pricey. Haha laugh if you want, but the calendar reminders are free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;google-calendar&quot;&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calendars have been around for ages. The print versions are still quite popular and understandably so. But as computer usage becomes more and more prevalent, we are transferring much of the things that we do in tangible form to things that we can do through using the computer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personally I use the Google calendar, but really there are many such applications floating around. I figure that I already have a Gmail account, so why not. (Of course, this line of reasoning sounds that in my post &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/10/22/googles-taking-over-the-worldand-i-dont-like-it/&quot;&gt;Google’s Taking Over The World…And I Don’t Like It&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, a nice feature of Google calendar is that I can have it e-mail me before the event occurs. I don’t use the application everyday, but awhile back I input all of my friends’ birthdays. Now it will e-mail me the day before someone’s birthday, so I’ll never egregiously forget a friend’s birthday!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Granted, it’d be better if I just remembered. It would show that I care more. It’s not that I don’t care. It’s just that I don’t want to make a mistake! It’s my failsafe, if you will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;* [Google Calendar website](http://www.google.com/calendar) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you have other tips for fellow forgetful fellows (or gals)?&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Yelp Like You Love It</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/yelp-like-you-love-it/"/> <updated>2008-03-03T19:30:16-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/yelp-like-you-love-it</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One thing that the Internet is an amazing tool for is the ability to draw on collective knowledge. By being so easy to reach more people, we are able to better understand things. We can, as a society, collaborate and pool our individual pieces of the puzzle to form a more completely picture. I’m getting away from myself with the metaphors. Anyways, I think that one of the more useful applications of this for me is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com&quot;&gt;yelp.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically I like to eat, and yelp helps me do that well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So yelp isn’t at all a new website, and I kind of think that a lot of people have already heard of and/or used it before. But it doesn’t matter because you know what? I get to post whatever I want to since this is my site. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I meant to post this quite some time back, but I’ve been sitting on this post for a really long time. And the only reason is because I wanted to upload a picture before I posted a link to my yelp page. How lame is that? How hard is it to get a profile picture nowadays? It took me all of 2 minutes to accomplish that strenuous task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personally I’ve found this site to be pretty helpful, and I think that it’s worthwhile to me to be involved with it. The premise is that reviews will be made by people that actually go to different establishments. While I use the site mainly for food, they do have reviews of everything from shopping to entertainment to health centers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most useful thing to me seems to be that you can limit your search by location and see a map of where these places are in relation to where you are. Because even though I might be looking for some amazing food, I’m not exactly willing to drive 50 miles to get said amazing food into my mouth. But 5 miles for some pretty reasonably tasty food? Yeah I could go for that. You can also further filter the results based on more specific criteria such as food ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Running off of a 5-star system, it’s easy to quickly see how popular a restaurant is. For more in depth (and often rather interesting) reviews, there are the user comments. These usually range from the short and not-too-helpful to the long and exceedingly useful. Many reviewers will describe their entire meal experience, and it helps you get a feel for what a restaurant is like without actually having been there. Sometimes you can find very useful menu suggestions in the comments as well. To reward reviewers, you can designate their comment as one that you thought was either cool, useful, or funny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is even a social aspect to this site as you can add friends on it. I’m not sure if that’s something that I’m really going for. According to yelp, I currently have no friends. Haha let’s hope that’s only on yelp!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My own page, with my reviews and info, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://derekwong.yelp.com&quot;&gt;derekwong.yelp.com&lt;/a&gt;. Check out some places that I’ve been to, but more importantly let’s all help each other out by supporting quality establishments. You’ll be thankful that next time you’re looking for a place to go to on your hot date. Because we all know that the key to the hot date is the food. Personality? Eh. Charm? Blah. Looks? Well you can’t help that anyways.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Profanity Without Using Curse Words</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/profanity-without-using-curse-words/"/> <updated>2008-02-26T08:15:40-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/profanity-without-using-curse-words</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Profanity is often used in society in order to express discontent. From mild, momentary displeasure to extreme fury, humans make use of a seemingly defined set of off-limit words to express their emotions. Often these words reference things which would generally be considered better left unspoken of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is profanity really? Apparently there are 5 types of swearing (according to Steven Pinker’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/NcbRlH&quot;&gt;The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature&lt;/a&gt; which I found a reference to in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity&quot;&gt;the Wikipedia article on profanity&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block;&quot; alt=&quot;profanity&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2305/2292724409_12bf79702c_m.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-size:.8em;&quot;&gt;Photo courtesy of Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/found_drama/&quot;&gt;Found Drama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dysphemistic - Opposite of euphemism. Force listener to think about negative thing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Abusive - Abuse, intimidate, or insult others&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Idiomatic - Refer to (but do not explicitly mention) something in order to arouse interest, be macho/cool, or express to peers that the setting is informal.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Emphatic - Emphasize what is being said (pretty self-explanatory)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cathartic - Rid oneself of negative feelings by outwardly expressing it&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can see how all of these are accurate descriptions for how profanity is used. It’s very interesting to study profanity and how it comes about. How it is sociological in a sense because profanity in our language is different from profanity in other languages (even taking into account translation). That’s not the issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The issue is that profanity comes out of your mouth much more than you’d like to admit. I feel your pain, it comes out of mine more than I’d like to admit, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, I’ve told people before that I do not cuss. And I’m absolutely correct in a strict sense of the term. I don’t use those words that society has impressed upon me as being profane. In fact, I don’t feel like I need to use profanity in order to express myself. I do feel the same emotions that my cursing brothers feel. (Okay I don’t actually have blood brothers, but I mean it in the mankind term.) And yet I don’t see that it’s too necessary. Am I aghast when I hear it? Not extremely so. Well I’m not with those from whom I expect nothing better. Some people are held to a higher standard, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I don’t cuss. But the thing is that I’ll cuss in spirit. I’ll use nice versions like “darn”, “crap”, and “shoot” instead of the usual fare. But does that make it any better? No, I’m beginning to think that it does not matter much at all. Even though the words are different and less offensive to the ear according to society, the usage shows that my mouth is still overflowing with what is in my heart. And I can see that all is not right in that region of my chest. I’m not as loving or as good as I profess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ah if only the distance between my head and my heart weren’t so far.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Difference Between Nerd, Geek, And Dork</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/difference-between-nerd-geek-and-dork/"/> <updated>2008-02-15T09:42:44-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/difference-between-nerd-geek-and-dork</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The common thought is that nerds, geeks, and dorks are one and the same.

(Looking them up online does prove amusing because apparently the first definition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=nerd&amp;amp;db=*&quot;&gt;nerd&lt;/a&gt; is “a stupid, irritating, ineffectual, or unattractive person.” Stinks to be called unattractive in the dictionary.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First off, the most important thing to note with any of these terms is that they can have both negative and positive connotations. I think that it mainly depends on your self-awareness. So if someone calls you a nerd, and you think of yourself as a nerd, then it’s not so bad. However, if you think that you’re a cool guy and you get called a nerd, all is not right with the world. As in many things in life, the failing of some expectation will result in your disappointment. And sadness. And low self-esteem. You get the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alright so back to the matter at hand. (Cue “Nothin’ But A G Thang”! &lt;del&gt;Hm I thought there was a rap song with “back to the matter at hand,” but I can’t find the song, let alone one that I could listen to in order to verify that. So…you get a small lame comment about how I tried and failed to remember a rap song of old.&lt;/del&gt;) Okay back to it, really now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is the breakdown of the different types (at least in my mind):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nerd - intelligent, industrious, understands things&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2261/2263814806_705169093b_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;computer programming&quot; /&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-size:.8em;&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/mjryall/&quot;&gt;Matt Ryall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;By day I’m a software engineer. (By night a superhero, but that’s another matter.) So I’m obviously a little biased if I give a good definition for a word and also remind everyone that it can describe me. But whatever, it’s what I actually think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some computer programmers (but by no means all of them) generally tend to be of the sort of people that want to delve deeper into understanding issues than others would. They want to truly understand how something works rather than just settling for using the end product. In the case of computer programming, while everyone else is content with looking at websites, using applications, and generally enjoying the products of the computer programming, the programmers themselves are working to create those products. And if they’re not creating them, then they’re trying to understand them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of them might not be like that, but those are the kind that will end up not being very good at what they do. Those are the ones that do not have &lt;a href=&quot;/professional-integrity/&quot;&gt;Professional Integrity&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll also end up being your boss, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a general sense, nerds can be from all different backgrounds. But I think that they can generally be described as someone who is willing to study and do the work in order to learn the stuff. I’m not quite sure that someone who is naturally gifted with intelligence but who doesn’t utilize it can be categorized as a nerd. No, I take that back. They cannot be categorized as a nerd. They’re just smart and lazy. Really, how much worse can you get? I think that most people would rather be dumb and hard-working than smart and lazy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2042/2263025755_b6b8488e2f_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;studying&quot; /&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-size:.8em;&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/sveinhal/&quot;&gt;Pragmagraphr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nerds can often be found in libraries, hunched over books, or wondering aloud about their surroundings. “Nerd” seems to be used most often in a complimentary way when describing others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone can very well be a nerd, and you wouldn’t be able to tell from the outside appearance. The stereotype of the nerd is a skinny guy with glasses and a pocket protector. But something that I learned in college is that the surfer dude can be just as much of a nerd as the stereotype. He just hides it better. Much better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unfortunately sad thing about the term nerd is that it doesn’t just apply to those that work hard. They actually have to be good at whatever it is that they’re doing, whether school or work. Someone that works hard but who still is not as successful is just that, a hard worker. (Of course, a hard worker is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; better than a smart lazy person.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, nerds rule. They’re even better when they know that they’re nerds and are not socially inept.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geek - Interested in things that others are not interested in, know a lot about their interests, but usually do not understand underlying principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I mentioned before when talking about nerds that there are computer programmers who will end up not being very good at programming. Unlike the more kindly description that I have above about nerdy computer programmers, these geek programmers fall into another category. And yeah, that category is lower.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2084/2263025783_bf718f63e3_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;star trek guy&quot; /&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-size:.8em;&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/clausmorell/&quot;&gt;ClausM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their work they will do things that they have no idea the meaning of. Unfortunately, they will sometimes correctly stab in the dark and get something right. That will only reinforce their thinking that their way is working. Stumbling, somehow they manage to get others to help them so that they eventually finish whatever it is that they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I generally liken geeks more to IT (Information Technology) type of people rather than computer programmers. These are the people that know how to use a computer very well, but who would not be able to program “Hello World.” They can fiddle with and modify settings and properties to no end. They love computers, but they don’t actually know how a computer works. Of course, not all IT folks are like this. In my experience, it just seems like they can more generally be described this way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even beyond the IT people, geeks can be interested in a wide spectrum of topics. They will often be interested in technology-related things. I think that it’s because not everyone understands these things. Since geeks do not have skills in some areas of life, they want to have an area of expertise where others could not compare to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So yes, geeks are the types of people that are not only interested in Star Trek, but who will also dress up to go to the premiere. They’ll also buy collector cards, read forums online, and read every single book about Star Trek. Obsess much? Yes they will. But you don’t know where the Klingon Galaxy is located relative to our current position in space, do you??&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Geeks come in all shapes and sizes. Of course, those are usually the odd shapes and sizes. They are generally not as hard to spot as the nerds because of their disregard for what others think of them. Their clothes don’t match, and they might occasionally offend others with their insufficient personal hygiene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, geeks have their strong points. They are dedicated to what they like. They don’t really care that much what other people think about them. And they generally rule the Internet. However, they don’t rule sports, social situations, or tangible environments. They’re awkward in situations that they’re not accustomed to (like the aforementioned) and tend to do things that give away their geekdom like go on incessantly about their favorite topic when the real topic is something entirely different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dork - Foolish, stupid, clumsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s not really any two-ways about it, “dork” is not too good of a term. Obviously if someone is using it in an endearing fashion, it’s not too bad. And if someone says it about themselves, it’s usually in an amusing and self-deprecating way. But the term itself doesn’t have too much positive spin on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:20px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block;&quot; src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2374/2263963848_a332a98b72_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dork&quot; /&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-size:.8em;&quot;&gt;Courtesy of Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/crankymediaguy/&quot;&gt;Cranky Media Guy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dorks are the type of people who will do silly things. That’s not to say that they’ll necessarily be the ones making grand gestures to make people laugh. But they are comfortable enough with themselves to do things like put a “dork” box on their head and laugh at themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the dork is aware that they are a dork, then it’s funny. If they’re not aware, then it’s painful to watch such a socially uncomfortable person try to get by. Now I’m not sure whether they feel awkward or if they feel at ease with themselves in those situations. All I know is that it’s sometimes hard for me to watch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once again, there are good traits in the dork. The self-aware dork is able to not take themselves too seriously. They are able to do what they want without caring about others’ opinions. And even the dork who is not self-aware is able to make others feel more comfortable simply because of their silliness. Nobody feels the fool when they’re next to someone who is more foolish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, &lt;strong&gt;I’m all of these things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what can you do with this knowledge?  I have no idea, but here are some fun items to get while you figure it out:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/TpLLAn&quot;&gt;xkcd book (Vol. 0)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;All kinds of xkcd clothes (&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/Nt6saj&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/QYbpPf&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/Rz6vp6&quot;&gt;favorites&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/N1iV5F&quot;&gt;Big old rimmed glasses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/Od1p2S&quot;&gt;Fanny pack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Package Waste</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/package-waste/"/> <updated>2008-02-07T09:40:21-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/package-waste</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t like how it’s impossible to get every last bit of semi-liquid type substances out of their container. Even more than that, though, it disappoints me that this slight irritation happens so often!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So as you probably know (or at least can guess from my blog’s name) that I’m Chinese. The stereotype is that Chinese people specifically (and Asian people in general) are a little bit stingy. Now, there are quite a lot of times that I can heartily agree that this stereotype has roots in reality. Maybe it’s because in China everyone has to fight for their own rights and properties since there are so many people vying for the limited resources. Ah communism at its best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But another thing that you should know is that I’m, in general, not very Chinese. Now what does that mean? Well I don’t even speak the language, let alone act out the whole stereotype. I am, for all intents and purposes, completely American. Nevertheless, I do have a frugal side to me. (I mean, I did share &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/18/3-little-tips-to-save/&quot;&gt;3 Little Tips To Save&lt;/a&gt; before.) And that frugal Chinese side of me doesn’t like that products are placed into packages that don’t allow me to utilize all that I’ve paid for!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are just so many of these items that we use! Don’t know what I’m talking about? Well what about:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;yogurt&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;mayonnaise&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;toothpaste&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;shampoo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;lotion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that’s just to name a few! There are obviously many other things that could fall into this category. One would think that after so many years of production and perfecting the whole process, a better solution would have been reached. But no. All we get are cheap gadgets like the toothpaste clip that will ensure that as much paste as possible is pushed towards the opening. Ah!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s a society to do? It’s time for a change. It’s time for a revolution.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Lock The Stall Door</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/lock-the-stall-door/"/> <updated>2008-01-31T10:30:28-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/lock-the-stall-door</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are some things that happen in life that cause you to become speechless. For some, this happens more often than for others. For me, it just happened. What in the world do you say when you walk into a stall and someone is sitting on the toilet doing their business?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wait a second, something is not right. Oh yeah, I’m not supposed to go into a stall when another person is already in there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You forgot to lock the door, you ninny.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Surprise!

You can’t. You’re speechless. This is one for the scrapbook (i.e. the blog). It’s even better when this person is from work and you see them around but don’t actually know them.

I’m talking about people getting my name wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generally I actually do think that I’m a bit forgettable. That might sound sad, but it’s the truth. I don’t make terribly flattering first impressions. That’s just how it has been. It’s gotten better, I think, as I’ve grown into my skin, but it’s probably fairly true still.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2307/2231389676_0d3748dd9b_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;my_name_is&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/oxygeon/&quot;&gt;Oxygen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Names are our unique key to life. It has a bit of our heritage in our surname, and it is the first gift that we are given. It’s a marking that we will have for our lifetime (that is unless we legally change it at some point). And it’s how we are known. Life would be different if we had a different name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Considering all of this, it’s not exactly pleasant when someone forgets your name. It makes you feel (and probably accurately so) that you’re not important enough to be remembered by the one who forgot. Nobody likes to be reminded of how unimportant they are. Everyone wants to be special and being known is just the first step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been a few instances where I’ve noticed this occurring to me. Thankfully it’s not exactly stuff that’s affected me, but it’s still noteworthy because I’m sure that there are many out there who wouldn’t take kindly to this happening to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;At work we had a going away brunch for someone, and people from all different departments were there. As I was standing there, someone was loudly saying someone else’s name and looking at me. Now usually, it is a very bad idea to respond to these greetings in your direction that might not necessarily be for you. You know the wave from strangers who are actually waving to the guy right behind you. That kind of thing. In any case, I was not responding to this girl because I figured she must have been trying to get someone else’s attention. She eventually turns to her friend and says, “He’s not responding to me, I guess.” Then she gets even closer to me and says this other guy’s name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Granted I was sideways so she only had a profile view. I turned to her, and I said that I was not who she thought I was. She realized her mistake and fell silent. That’s right, lady. You’re wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same day as the first example, I was walking by someone’s desk, and he said, “What’s up, —–?” This other name was another Asian guy in our department. I knew that he was talking to me because nobody else was around, and I said, “It’s Derek, not ——.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bad thing is that he &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; know the difference between us. We traveled for quite a few days together! And we work in the same department! This one was probably a more honest slip of the tongue, but I still thought it pretty amusing considering that it was the same day. To exacerbate the matter, the same guy cc’d me on an e-mail and spelled my name Derrick. And we’ve been working together for about 15 months. Lovely, just lovely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;So another instance where forgetting a name can be bad is if you remember the other person’s name, and they do not remember your name. Bad beans. If you both forget, it’s acceptable. But if you both do not, all is not right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I recently went to a fellowship group again after not going for a couple of months. I remembered a few of the people’s name because of talking to them or because I secretly actually knew stuff about them. Haha creepy as that might sound, it was more like an “I know that they asked my friend out, but they don’t me” kind of deal. In any case, it was no good for me to remember their names since they forgot mine. Boo hoo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So basically we all need to learn these things:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;We need better memories&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;All Asians do not look alike&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get more confidence so you don’t care if people forget your name because you’re above that&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t respond to women who are yelling, no good can ever come of it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Figured Out My Personality Type?</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/figured-out-my-personality-type/"/> <updated>2008-01-23T13:33:06-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/figured-out-my-personality-type</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think that personality types, a much discussed topic, are definitely interesting. However, I’ve never known what I am.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In regards to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator&quot;&gt;Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&lt;/a&gt; (and slightly the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keirsey_Temperament_Sorter&quot;&gt;Keirsey Temperament Test&lt;/a&gt;), I never knew which of the 16 types I was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a sample, I could never even definitively decide whether I was an introvert or an extrovert. I think that the trouble comes because I have an opinion of myself since I am always with myself, but others might see a version of me that is different than the full picture. Suffice to say, since it’s hard for me to get by the very first step, I could never fully complete the puzzle of my personality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But perhaps that has changed!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now whether this is just applicable to me now or whether it’s categorically applicable to me, I do not know. All I know is that I felt like I was reading about myself while I examined the description.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, I believe that I am an:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP&quot;&gt;INTP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Proud Of Nothing</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/proud-of-nothing/"/> <updated>2008-01-13T22:58:13-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/proud-of-nothing</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People will get proud over anything. Even those that have nothing to be proud of will somehow find themselves becoming proud of something. It’s rather amazing really. When you stop to think about it, none of us really has anything to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a wide variety of things that pride is claimed. I think that the most ridiculous ones are those things over which we have no control. Here are some of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;nationalismpatriotismgeographic-devotion&quot;&gt;Nationalism/Patriotism/Geographic devotion&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is rampant around the world and throughout all of time. However, it’s rather silly to be proud of where you come from simply because that’s where you came from, don’t you think? Sure it’s a great way to connect to people when you first meet them, but how much do you really have to be proud of if you grew up somewhere? Usually it’s not too much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that perhaps the only thing that I could understand about this is if one had to grow up in a difficult environment. It shapes a person to be able to grow up in that type of surrounding. But for all of those people who are proud of where they grew up, what country they were born in, what their heritage is, and so on, you better rethink it. Because you had no hand in that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And to think that people get into wars over this issue all of the time is mind boggling. You mean to tell me that you hate that guy because of where he was born? But he had no control over that, he didn’t choose to be born there!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;height&quot;&gt;Height&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you met people who were proud of their height? I think that might be one of the most ridiculous things ever because you absolutely have no control over your height. You can lose or gain weight, have plastic surgery to fix your looks, and any number of things to modify your physical appearance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what can you do about your height? Diddly squat, I do believe. Unless you have that limb lengthening surgery. Anyways, once again you have no control over how tall you are/will be. You can hope for good genes, but it’s much more impressive to just be able to deal with those that you’ve been given. And better yet, it’s impressive to be able to overlook (no pun intended) it in others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;discovering-music-artistsclothing-brands&quot;&gt;Discovering Music Artists/Clothing Brands&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I mean really? You’re going to be proud of the fact that you found out about a band before anyone else did? You had no hand in their success. You’re not playing bass or pounding those drums for them. All you did was take a little listen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay sure, it’s very nice that you spend the time and try out different artists than the popular fare served up to the masses. Maybe you even spent a little bit of money to try them out. But when the band becomes popular, if you find yourself bringing up the fact that you listened to them for years, I’ll have you know that I think that you’re a lame-o.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Same thing goes for clothing brands (and probably a slew of other things). You’re not making the clothes, you’re just buying a sweater. $20 bucks. You daredevil you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;age&quot;&gt;Age&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re young or old, what can you really say about your age? It won’t change a lick no matter what you do. You can lie about it, you can deceive others by changing your appearance, but this is an absolute in this world that you have no control over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it’s so interesting when people see their age as something to be proud of. In the past I’ve seen it because people think that they’re immediately wiser for the simple fact that they’ve lived more days. I grant them that it’s generally true that wisdom comes with age. But isn’t that usually more like decades of experience?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growing up in school, I was meeting people with years or less worth more days who thought that they were somehow wiser than I. I thought (and still do) think that is just ludicrous. It’s like they can’t find anything to be proud of so they just grasp for something that nobody can change. How about instead of doing that we go out and actually gain some of that useful wisdom by getting a life, huh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;salvation&quot;&gt;Salvation&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well I’m a Christian. Maybe you knew that, maybe you didn’t. Now you do. Anyways, I’ve got a bone to pick with those people that speak of their salvation with an air of superiority, as if they did anything at all except believe. This might stir up the pot a little bit, but there isn’t much that separates you from that unsaved guy next to you. I boast in Jesus Christ, too, but He did the work, not I. I just said, “Yes, I’ll believe.”&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>That Hide-Me-Right-Now-Please Feeling</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/that-hide-me-right-now-please-feeling/"/> <updated>2008-01-05T22:18:06-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/that-hide-me-right-now-please-feeling</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know what I’m talking about. It’s that feeling that you get when you do something really hard or super embarrassing. You know, like when someone catches you dancing when you thought that you were alone or when you ask someone out or peeing in your pants in front of the entire class or saying something stupid that you immediately knew that you should not have said pr maybe you just told someone that you were master of the Earth, stood on a railing on a large ship, spread your arms, and fell overboard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You know, it’s that embarrassed, how can I live with myself, I can’t stop saying “oh my goodness” feeling. I love it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that I’m a late bloomer because sometimes I act like I’m in junior high. Haha I love it and hate it all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I’m constantly stuck wondering how in the world people do all of the things that they do when I can’t even begin. It’s like everyone else is lifting weights, and I’m still stuck trying to gain admission to the gym.

When one is just starting to get to know another person, there is a lot of feeling out in conversation. Both people need to be talking and questions need to be asked. This is some basic knowledge about relationships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2040/2153285874_fd145e3f75_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cards&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo courtesy of flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/privatenobby/&quot;&gt;privatenobby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almost more importantly than how to build a relationship, though, is how easy it is to destroy it. It’s important to know how relationships can be destroyed because that is the only way that it can be avoided. It seems to me that I can very easily liken the building of a relationship to the creation of a house of cards. For both creations it takes far greater time and effort to build them up than it takes to destroy them. With the house of cards all you need is an inadvertent swipe of the hand or even an exhaled breath to cause it all to come tumbling down. With relationships (whether friendships, romantic relationships, or otherwise) a simple outburst, a snide comment, a hurtful action, or even an ill-advised joke can undo all of the time and effort involved in developing a relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that whether you’ve been on the receiving end of a one of these relationship destroyers or whether you’ve dished one out yourself, you know that they’re almost never worth it. Unfortunately I think that most of the time people don’t even know what they’ve done. They can’t see it because it’s not visual, it’s within the person. Take a look around and you’ll see cards everywhere.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Music Remedies Menial Tasks</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/music-remedies-menial-tasks/"/> <updated>2007-12-19T08:10:14-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/music-remedies-menial-tasks</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone has to perform menial tasks. Well I guess not everyone, but those of us who actually have to clean our own house, iron our own clothes, and wash our own dishes do. They’re not fun. That’s why they’re deemed menial tasks! But for myself, I’ve found that music is making them much more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that I was finding that having these tasks to do (not necessarily everyday, but very often) was causing me to start doing them rather begrudgingly. It’s not that I hate the idea of doing work, but I just don’t like having multiple completely lacking in fun tasks queued up for me to do. They’re often monotonous and sometimes even physically tiring! Nobody considers them fun. But there’s hope!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.&lt;br /&gt; -Berthold Auerbach&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;People have known for so long that music speaks to us in ways that are indescribable. And I’ve found that simply listening to music while performing tasks that I would not otherwise prefer to do makes them all the more bearable. Now whether that’s because I can dance around, hum, or bob my head, who’s to say? All I know is that it’s there, and it’s good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From John Mayer to DJ Maj to Al Green to Frank Sinatra to Deitrick Haddon &amp;amp; Unity Praise to Norah Jones to Bleach, and so on and so forth, I like me some music.

Well the other day I was thinking about what our world would be like without our friend fire. And a very different world it would be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It sure would be cold. Haha and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Grylls&quot;&gt;Bear Grylls&lt;/a&gt; wouldn’t be able to teach us that fire is so important to survive in the wild. Hopefully he would still eat crazy things on his show, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But once you get past the fact that we’d all be shivering perhaps you think that it wouldn’t be so bad because we could have electricity to warm us. Electric heaters are all over the place, and they certainly do not require fire. So we wouldn’t freeze to death and perhaps people could still live in Alaska.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there are &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; things that we would not have in our use. We wouldn’t be able to have:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cars - That sure would change our world, wouldn’t it? They’re currently needed because gasoline engines use sparks to create a small combustion that, through a series of gears and mechanical parts, powers the wheels. Granted I guess a spark isn’t exactly fire. However I’m assuming that we would have gotten nowhere close to a spark if we didn’t have fire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Food - How in the world would we cook it? Would we be eating lots and lots of sushi? Maybe just raw vegetables? How animalistic!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trains - Perhaps you don’t think that losing trains is any great loss. I mean who really rides trains nowadays anyways? Well lest you forget, trains still carry vast amounts of goods across land. They’re often supposed to be more efficient than trucks because of their fixed rail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Swords - How will the ninjas work? They’ll be put out of a job. But seriously, there would be no metallurgy as we know it because the metal needs to be shaped after being heated…by fire. So kiss your katana goodbye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fire has got to get a mention in the race for best creation ever. Without it we’d be a hungry bunch of people eating who knows what. And we’d all be biking everywhere. Well that would be a good thing because then we wouldn’t be obese. But everyone would be walking around sweaty and smelly. And to add insult to injury, everything metal would be ugly and rough. Put a chunk of that in your ear and see how you like it. Makes one a little more thankful for the things that we take for granted, does it not? Still it’s kind of fun to have an imagination!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>A Quote About True Friends</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-quote-about-true-friends/"/> <updated>2007-12-03T11:44:45-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-quote-about-true-friends</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Friends are such an integral part of life. They are there for us to have fun, to share with, and to truly live our lives with. And, just as in many of our relationships in life, they can be a source of pain. I’m not necessarily saying that I feel that right now, but that doesn’t discount the truth in the statement, does it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People have a tendency to let relationships deteriorate. It takes constant effort and a willing heart to maintain those relationships that might otherwise fall by the way side. Being a couple of years out of college I can so easily see how much my friendships and relationships with a lot of my friends has done so. It’s on the one hand tragic but on the other hand just a fact of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wow I really was thinking that I need some lighter-hearted posts. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So here’s my quote, tell me what you think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;True friends do not prove themselves in the exciting moments of life. Hardships and joyous occasions are not where they’re found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, the proving ground of a true friend is in the mundane and dull moments of the everyday life. -Derek Wong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well I’ve actually thought about this before, but I had never gotten around to find out whether or not someone else has said it before I have. As usual, someone probably did. But it’d take too long to try to find and properly give them credit. So if someone else happens upon it, I’ll gladly give someone else the credit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically all I mean is that it’s so easy to feel close to people when they’re going through things that are interesting. But life consists of only a few of those moments. It’s so much nicer to have friends and people around you that actually want to hear about the days when life isn’t as exciting or exceptionally interesting. I feel like I’ve said that before, but it must have been in conversation rather than on my blog. Granted it’s even better to just be interesting all of the time, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>A Quote For Regret And Rejection</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-quote-for-regret-and-rejection/"/> <updated>2007-11-26T14:41:10-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-quote-for-regret-and-rejection</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we have to choose our poison, don’t we? It’s not always blue pill or red pill, sometimes it’s bad and worse. In any case, I feel like I must have heard this quote, but I can’t seem to find its source online. I think that it’s pretty good, what do you think?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regret is 10 times worse than rejection. -Derek Wong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some reason in my head the quote actually is “100 times,” but I think that’s an exaggeration. I’m more comfortable with 10 times. So if nobody has made this quote, and I actually did make up this quote then that’s just fine with me. And if someone did say this, let me know so that I can give due credit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d venture to guess that many people choose regret simply because it is the easier of the two. Rejection is a pain that we all know and despise. It hurts us upfront and in the short term quite a lot. On the other hand regret takes some time to fester and build up its power. And it’s a longer term pain to boot. No thanks.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Being Surpassed</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/being-surpassed/"/> <updated>2007-11-21T13:14:37-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/being-surpassed</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently came upon something that made me both excited and sad. I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://groceryguide.com&quot;&gt;GroceryGuide.com&lt;/a&gt;. As you know I have previously worked on my own similar application called &lt;a href=&quot;http://prices.goingthewongway.com&quot;&gt;GROP&lt;/a&gt;. However, as any user can obviously see, I have been beat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;grop-my-idea&quot;&gt;GROP: My Idea&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I realized that there was a problem with grocery shopping. It was too difficult to just jump in and be able to figure out whether or not a particular price was a “good” price for an item. I would have needed years of experience in order to intuitively conclude that a price was good. And even that is not safe because the human mind (in general) is just not precise enough to remember hundreds of items and their respective prices. However, a computer would be most excellent at such a task. This idea was totally my own, and I was in no way influenced by other ideas to solve this same problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore I thought that it would be worth a try to create a web application that users would be able to input their prices that they’ve bought items at. It would create aggregate data from said application such as the average price bought at. This would help users to figure out if a particular product was listed at a “good” price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2023/2052843479_bbc0dfc5cc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;groceryguide&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;groceryguide&quot;&gt;GroceryGuide&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then I happened on a site that had much of what I was doing. Okay well I haven’t touched the application in awhile, but we nevertheless had overlaps in our goals and application. Except it was nicer. And prettier. And probably worked better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best thing about it, though, was that it didn’t just have data from users’ input but it actually had all of the sale prices from all stores! This would have been ideal for my own application except I have no idea how they swung that. So either they are getting some kind of list from each of the supermarkets, which would have required getting some deal. Or else they possibly had to create custom mechanisms to scrape their listings online. I rather doubt the latter, and I am impressed with the former.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;my-feelings&quot;&gt;My Feelings&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting feeling to be passed. I’m not sure, but I would think that it’s a pretty safe bet that GroceryGuide started before I had even had the thought to create my own web application. And now that it has an upgrade over its previous version, it seems pretty and functional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know that in life, getting beat happens daily. The old get older and the new get better. In sports, the younger athletes coming up &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; surpass you some day. It’s just a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Records are made to be broken&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;is a quote that has already been stated, I’m sure. And if not, then there it is. There must be new ideas, new modifications, and so on. Sometimes the new isn’t always better. Just ask Hershey with their &lt;em&gt;Change is bad&lt;/em&gt; advertising campaign. And sometimes that’s true. But as a general rule, beware if you’re the front runner because someone is going to pass you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay so I’m not the front runner. In fact, I found it hard to even get people that I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; to use GROP, let alone anyone else. I had lots of ideas of what I wanted to do, many of which were covered by GroceryGuide already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;on-the-other-hand&quot;&gt;On The Other Hand…&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are still things that I benefit from by having my own custom web application. I can use it to figure out when I last purchased something. I cover items that are likely not covered by GroceryGuide (can you really seem them having listings from the Chinese supermarket??).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;and-finally&quot;&gt;And Finally&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mine isn’t as pretty. It doesn’t have as much information. But there are still benefits. I think that I should continue to input prices. However, I kind of doubt that I’d put much more development time into my project. There were lots of things that I wanted to do such as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make it prettier. This would have made people want to use it! People are attracted to good looks, even if they don’t want to admit it. This goes for being attracted to people as well. You know that it does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throw on some AJAX to make it more user-friendly. This goes along with making it prettier, but it is a bit more than just looks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Improve the searching and viewing of data so that users who just wanted to look did not have to go through the same extensive process that users who were adding had to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, in hindsight I think that I went a little overboard on the database relations because I had a very Web 1.0 mindset of how I wanted to do it. Oh well, live and learn. Man this post is full of fun little tidbits of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So congratulations to GroceryGuide for having a very nice (from what I can see) application. And I’m going to use it. But you know what, in some ways it’s still not as good as my own because that one is mine. But I’m glad that someone out there is working hard on solving this problem that very many of us have.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Finding Out Who You Are</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/finding-out-who-you-are/"/> <updated>2007-11-14T12:16:36-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/finding-out-who-you-are</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you hear a word or phrase and you don’t hear the entire context you are very prone to make a mistake about how it’s actually being used.

Super.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2263/2021230425_7b5838d1d2_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;python&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Courtesy of Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/ricmcarthur/&quot;&gt;ricmcarthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;a-snake&quot;&gt;A snake!&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generally not dangerous to humans, they are intimidating for their large size. They kill their prey by constricting them and thus are extremely strong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;another-programming-language&quot;&gt;Another programming language&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;Focusing on readability, it’s rather a joy to work in compared to other languages. This high-level programming language sits over C/C++ and allows for all types of extensibility. It also sits in contrast to Perl because it strives to only have a single method, and preferably only that single method of doing something. It is easy to learn and easy to read although it allows great functionality if you so desire. Can you tell that I like it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;conclusion-about-me&quot;&gt;Conclusion About Me&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what do all of these things have in common? I’m sure that if you’ve read them all (which, thank you very much for doing so!) you’ll notice that there is a disambiguation that tends towards the nerd in me. That’s right, they can all be nerdy. Haha I wonder if anyone else out there thought of the nerdy options for those phrases.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Watching A Whole Crowd</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/watching-a-whole-crowd/"/> <updated>2007-11-09T08:15:48-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/watching-a-whole-crowd</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I just finished traveling for work. It was quite an interesting experience. First of all, I’ve not traveled for work before. Secondly, it was supremely interesting getting to watch this whole slew of people that I would not normally get to watch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People watching was probably one of the more interesting things that I got to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;why-do-we-like-to-watch-people&quot;&gt;Why do we like to watch people?&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m of the mind that we (well at least I) like to watch people because we are interested in the human experience. Well that and because very often it’s pretty amusing. Or perhaps at the very heart of the matter, we like to see how we stack up against everyone else that’s around. Sometimes they’re stranger, sometimes they’re scarier, and sometimes they’re just like us. Alright they’re never just like us. We wouldn’t ever want to admit as much anyways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People are interesting. Even the boring ones. Because the boring ones are very interesting when they don’t know that they’re being watched.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;benefits-of-people-watching&quot;&gt;Benefits of people watching&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;laughter&quot;&gt;Laughter&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;You gotta hand it to people, they’ll do some ridiculously hilarious things when they’re unaware that they’re being watched&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;entertainment&quot;&gt;Entertainment&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just because you forgot your electronic device or book, you’ll still have something to do. Almost no matter where are (unless you live as a hermit in which case this post is not for you).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;learn&quot;&gt;Learn&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other people have had different experiences in their lives. Perhaps watching them will teach you lessons about how you can be a better person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;smile&quot;&gt;Smile&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catch those “cute” moments that nobody was supposed to see. You know, that darling thing that a child did or that self-sacrificing act that someone does for another. It’ll brighten your day and maybe next time you’ll be the one who puts a smile on somebody else’s slightly-creepy-people-watching face. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;help&quot;&gt;Help&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re not aware or watching, someone could need your help and you would have never known. If you’re people watching, you’re (by definition) aware of your surroundings. So that makes it easier if you see someone getting hurt or in need of your assistence because you’ll see the need and lend a hand, won’t you? Let’s hope so!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People watching is a great thing to do. And it’s even more fun to do when you are surrounded by people that you would not normally be around (as I was this past weekend for my work conference). I didn’t know the vast majority of them, but I still enjoyed getting to watch them. I got to see how they interacted, I got to laugh at humorous things that I saw, and I got to amuse myself even (hopefully nobody really noticed me doing so).&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Tracking Your Own Comments</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/tracking-your-own-comments/"/> <updated>2007-11-04T11:30:29-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/tracking-your-own-comments</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Commenting is a fun part of going around to different blogs. One thing that I’ve found is that it’s easy to respond to comments left on my own blog because I have a central place to access them from (namely my WordPress administration panel). It allows me to easily have conversations with people that stop by and leave comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;leaving-comments-on-other-blogs&quot;&gt;Leaving Comments On Other Blogs&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;However I’ve found that it’s not quite as to do with comments that I’ve left on other blogs. The reason for that is because I don’t have that central place to access to see all of my comments! I’m not very well going to remember the URL of every post that I leave a comment on. That would frankly be ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve found a key to this problem. I’m sure that there are others out there, but I think that this one works decently enough. Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://co.mments.com&quot;&gt;co.mments.com&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see what I mean. In fact, you can even let other people see what you’re commenting on so that they can check it out and see if they’re interested in the same posts! Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://co.mments.com/people/goingthewongway&quot;&gt;my public co.mments.com page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Extra! Extra! Check Out The New Theme!</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/extra-extra-check-out-the-new-theme/"/> <updated>2007-11-01T09:00:17-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/extra-extra-check-out-the-new-theme</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So after more time than I’d like to admit, I’ve finally finished enough of my theme to put it on goingthewongway! I’m excited that I’ve changed it. Check it out and let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now I present to you: Soi-disant&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve only changed my theme once to (Not So) Fresh as I posted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/09/new-look/&quot;&gt;New Look&lt;/a&gt;. That was 8 months ago and since then quite a bit has changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;why-i-wanted-to-make-my-own-theme&quot;&gt;Why I wanted to make my own theme&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;have-a-unique-look-to-my-blog&quot;&gt;Have a unique look to my blog&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve come across other blogs that had the same theme, and that wasn’t too exciting for me. I want and like to be my own. So even though the last one did look nice, it was unfortunate because other people thought that it looked nice as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;learn-much-much-more-web-design&quot;&gt;Learn much, much more web design&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;CSS in particular, HTML and PHP to a lesser degree since I already knew a fair amount before doing the theme. Part of who I am wants to understand how things work and why. So learning new things can be very exciting to me. Not to mention the fact that it’s very pertinent to my profession of computer programming. (Although I must admit that I believe that I lack the creativity necessary to actually ever become a web designer. I know the nuts and bolts but lack the vision. :P)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;create-a-fluid-display&quot;&gt;Create a fluid display&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted one that would show up well on the very popular 1024x768 and 1280x1024 screen resolutions in addition to any other screen resolutions. I’m sorry to say that it’s very likely that anything below 1024x768 won’t look all that great. A fluid display means that the text and page elements will expand according to how much space is available. My previous theme was fixed width so it didn’t look too great to me on higher resolution displays.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h6 id=&quot;speed-things-up&quot;&gt;Speed things up&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last theme used a fair amount of images to create all of the nice effects. And that’s nice for people on fast connections (which at this point is a very fair amount of people). However there still are people on slower connections, and I want my blog to be accessible to them as well, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5 id=&quot;soi-disant&quot;&gt;Soi-disant&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got the name of this theme (Soi-disant) by looking up a word of the day online. Lame, huh? I thought it was cool because it means calling oneself thus, self-styled, or so-called. Seemed interesting to me so there it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I did it all for this theme: header logo, PHP code, HTML, CSS. It was a learning experience, that is for sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wordpress theme designer: &lt;strong&gt;check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>New Wordpress Comment Plugins</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/new-wordpress-comment-plugins/"/> <updated>2007-10-30T12:34:16-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/new-wordpress-comment-plugins</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like commenting on blogs, and I also very much enjoy receiving comments. So I added some new plugins that I thought would facilitate that process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plugins that I have added and am now using on this blog are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meidell.dk/archives/2006/12/19/brians-threaded-comments-159/&quot;&gt;Brian’s Threaded Comments&lt;/a&gt; which allows for comments to be in threads rather than just as a single list. This is nice because it can get confusing in the way that I used to just use an “@ user” type of response. The only drawback is that I’ll probably have to limit the number of levels that nesting will occur because it will make the comments unreadable as they get more and more narrow.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This code looks stupid and ugly on my current theme, but I’m going to change it very soon so I’m still going to post it. Most people don’t care about this, but I figured that I’d put it out there if anyone did find it useful and didn’t know too much PHP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So is here is the change so that there will be no “Reply to this comment” link if the comments for a post are already closed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&#39;reply&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;?php global $user_ID; global $post; if ( get_option(&quot;comment_registration&quot;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !$user_ID ) echo &#39;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&#39;.get_option(&#39;siteurl&#39;) . &#39;/wp-login.php?redirect_to=&#39; . get_permalink() . &#39;&quot;&amp;gt;Log in to Reply&#39;; elseif (&#39;open&#39; == $post-&amp;gt;comment_status) {?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&#39;#&#39; onclick=&#39;moveAddCommentBelow(&quot;div-comment-&amp;lt;?php echo $c-&amp;gt;comment_ID ?&amp;gt;&quot;, &amp;lt; ?php echo $c-&amp;gt;comment_ID ?&amp;gt;, true); return false;&#39;&amp;gt;Reply to this comment&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt; ?php } ?&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also added code from my original comments.php in my theme file so that if a user is logged in, it will not ask them for their information (name, e-mail, etc). Although I don’t think that there are too many people with accounts on my blog (go for it, it’s not so bad) I figured that it was at least a solution that I enjoyed more for my own sake. However the code change was too much for this so I’m not going to post it in this entry. Other than that it’s pretty super! I like the look, and I hope that others will appreciate it. And most of all I hope that it fosters more discussion!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesmckay.net/code/comment-timeout/&quot;&gt;Comment Timeout&lt;/a&gt; lets me fight another problem on my blog. And that problem is spam comments. Hateful, despicable spam comments. They take at least a little bit of time to go through sometimes when people’s comments get caught in moderation. So I’ve decided that since it rather makes sense to close the comments on old posts, I will. It’s not as if people particularly post comments on my old posts anyways.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally it has the ability to keep the comments active if the post is deemed “active.” The plugin is fairly full-featured with some customizable options such as the timeout period, etc. Not a bad plugin if I do say so myself. It was a better option for me than the very basic Close Old Posts plugin written by Matt Mullenweg and listed on the wordress.org site.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think of the new plugins! Does it make you want to leave more comments?&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Just Looking At You!</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/just-looking-at-you/"/> <updated>2007-10-28T16:30:01-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/just-looking-at-you</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know what is disconcerting? When someone is just looking at you. I’ve noticed this while being both the looker and the lookee. (I just made that word up but I could have actually made that into more proper English. Sometimes I’m just a rebel like that.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when you’re doing anything, whether that’s talking to someone, eating, studying, or anything in between it is quite interesting to suddenly look up and see that someone had been staring at you. You know that they’d been staring since they would not have been making a looking motion just as you’re looking. So if they look away quickly or even if they keep looking, it’s bound to make you feel a little bit uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;why-do-we-dislike-getting-stared-at&quot;&gt;Why do we dislike getting stared at?&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d say that it’s likely because we, as humans, don’t like to be analyzed and have someone witnessing everything that we’re doing. We enjoy having some semblance of privacy and freedom to be who we are without being judged. That’s the deep reason. Practically, we just don’t like being creeped out. Or other people noticing our flaws. Like that booger in your nose that you can feel but can’t pick because that would just be obviously gross.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to do?&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hard as it might be, I say stare back until they back down. This sounds like a childish game of chicken, but I still think that it’s part of a rather fun solution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well I suppose that a logical solution would also be to just be comfortable enough with yourself so that you don’t need to feel nervous or uneasy with someone following your every move. But not everyone is going to be able to get to that point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hmm…well you could also go the route of blatantly asking, “What’s your problem, buster?” (or some other suitable term for a girl if it’s a she rather than a he). But that takes some guts. And if you’ve got those guts, you probably don’t care a lick what they’re staring at because you have more important things to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So most of us are just going to suck it up. And not know what to do. And hope that whoever is looking at us is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not a creepy stalker&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone who is attractive so that the staring is more of a compliment&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not laughing at you on the inside&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah I don’t have a solution, I wish that I did. Because then I could utilize it! If you’ve got one, let me know because I’m no fan of this myself.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Partition Your Hard Drive</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/partition-your-hard-drive/"/> <updated>2007-10-25T12:20:56-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/partition-your-hard-drive</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hard drives consist of many bits, configured in a particular way (of which the explanation is far far beyond the scope of this blog post). But needless to say we like to view the hard drive as a block of space that we can store things in. The hard drives each have partitions setup on them, the most common case being a single partition for the operating system and all of the data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However this is not exactly what a lot of people want. Sometimes they want different partitions because they want different operating systems on the same computer, but more often it’s just because they want some kind of division between their data and their operating system, applications, etc. For more reasons, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(computing)#Purpose&quot;&gt;the purpose of partitioning&lt;/a&gt; according to wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you install an operating system for the first time, it has a partitioning tool that allows you to choose how you want to partition your new hard drive. Well often if you buy your computer retail then they’ve already set it up for you. But &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you were to actually go through the entire process yourself, then you’d likely partition the hard drive with the operating system installer’s tool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then, what if your hard drive is currently set up differently than you want? What do you do once your data is all over your drive? Well you have a couple of choices. You can either completely format (and erase) your hard drive and start from scratch. This is obviously not going to be your first choice if you have data on your hard drive already as that would involve backing up and restoring all of your data. That seems like a rather long process unless you’re having serious errors and really do want to start from scratch (which is sometimes the desired outcome). So the other option is to use some software to re-partition your hard drive while maintaining your data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;norton-partitionmagic-replacement&quot;&gt;Norton PartitionMagic Replacement&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many people know about Norton PartitionMagic in order to do exactly this task. But after eschewing that (in my mind) expensive software, I would highly encourage everyone to check out the free and open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://partedmagic.com/&quot;&gt;Parted Magic&lt;/a&gt;. That is what I used! It’s a LiveCD (which means that you download it, burn it on a cd, insert it into your computer, and boot off the CD. It utilizes the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gparted.sourceforge.net/index.php&quot;&gt;Gparted&lt;/a&gt; application for the partitioning duties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a snap to use when I recently upgrade my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; installation from Feisty Fawn (7.04) to Gutsy Gibbon (7.10) (don’t you love the alliterative names, I know that I do).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to use just:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Defrag your hard drive&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&quot;http://dw.com.com/redir?edId=3&amp;amp;siteId=4&amp;amp;oId=3000-2094_4-10716910&amp;amp;ontId=2094_4&amp;amp;spi=acdc544bd173f09f9d8c0426e5c554e7&amp;amp;lop=link&amp;amp;tag=tdw_dltext&amp;amp;ltype=dl_dlnow&amp;amp;pid=10716910&amp;amp;mfgId=6292732&amp;amp;merId=6292732&amp;amp;destUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.download.com%2F3001-2094_4-10716910.html%3Fspi%3Dacdc544bd173f09f9d8c0426e5c554e7&quot;&gt;the .iso image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Burn to a CD as a disk image&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Insert into computer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Boot to the CD (you might need to change a BIOS setting or two in order to do this)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create, resize, modify your partitions and keep your data intact!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Google's Taking Over The World...And I Don't Like It</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/googles-taking-over-the-worldand-i-dont-like-it/"/> <updated>2007-10-22T17:20:04-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/googles-taking-over-the-worldand-i-dont-like-it</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With Google increasing the size of Gmail to a bit less than 4 GB last week, I got to thinking about them as a company. They’re ubiquitous to anyone in a developed country because they are the de facto standard for search engines as of today. And they’re good at what they do, they’re real good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However they’re obviously not all knowledgeable or almighty. They’re not God. Although I suppose that they could be a god to some. Anyways, not everything that they do is superior. But the fact that there is so much &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/28/fanaticism/&quot;&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt; about Google that you should get an indication that something is up. And I’m not down with that. (Ha…ha…I guess that I still get amused by things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/13/up-or-down-same-difference/&quot;&gt;Up Or Down, Same Difference&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever the case, I know that for me they’re taking over more and more of my Internet profile. They have my e-mail with Gmail, they are starting to get some of my documents with Google Documents, they have a lot of my searching (although as of late I’ve been trying to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/28/winning-with-blingo/&quot;&gt;Winning With Blingo&lt;/a&gt; instead of going directly through Google), search all over the place with Google Maps, and I use Google Reader to peruse my RSS feeds. Update: I forgot about the obvious Google Analytics, Google AdSense, and the now Google-owned FeedBurner that I use for this blog. That’s a lot of Google products if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even more than the fact that Google is being used so often, they scare me for other reasons. The fact that they are creating portions where you are required to have a Google login (such as collaborating on documents) is understandable but at the same time rather monopolistic-leaning if you ask me. I’d wish that they’d allow create methods by which to create opportunities for people without having to create Google logins (easy as that may be). People need/want/love choice. And some people choose not to have a Google account. Arguments that they don’t need to use shared collaboration ignore the fact that they might need to. And then there are even scarier things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/31/google-web-history/&quot;&gt;Google Web History&lt;/a&gt; (where they keep track of everything that you access from their site) and impinge on my personal life while also laying down the path to even scarier types of behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can see how as they get bigger and try to innovate, they could tread on territory that I’d much rather they stayed far away from. Somethings are more important than having perfectly relevant ads or a computer that can predict what you want to know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their well-known unofficial motto is “Don’t Be Evil,” I can’t help but get the feeling that the change of evil increases as corporations do. And Google is getting to be the big boy on the block. As big of a proponent as I might be for capitalism at work, that doesn’t mean that I always need to support the entities involved.

Because ants do that. They inspire me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What would life be like without insects?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well there’d be less annoyance because ants wouldn’t invade your house. Then again, who’s going to clean up those little bits of food that you’ve dropped and are unaware that they’re there?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Structures would be more sound because termites wouldn’t get to the wood that holds it together. But then how are you going to justify spending lots of money on rebuilding?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You won’t get stung by bees, wasps, and more. However, honey is very good. And good for you. And it doesn’t expire because of its antibacterial properties “as a result of the low water activity causing osmosis, hydrogen peroxide effect, and high acidity” (ref. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey&quot;&gt;Wikipedia’s article about honey&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you’re walking, you won’t get attacked by a swarm of gnats that endlessly annoy you. But then you won’t get amusing things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=dw-aldsbugs100507&amp;amp;prov=yhoo&amp;amp;type=lgns&quot;&gt;gnats helping the Indians win their game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, even though there are lots and lots of things that I don’t particularly care for about ants. However, I’ve learned from reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/NOp6Lw&quot;&gt;Foundation and Earth&lt;/a&gt; that perhaps making worlds into what they were not intended has many unintended and distasteful consequences. So let’s leave everything as it was intended in its beautiful and wonderful balance. Even if it can bug us to no end. Sorry, I had to. :P&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Cut Up And Not Loving It</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/cut-up-and-not-loving-it/"/> <updated>2007-10-10T14:03:16-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/cut-up-and-not-loving-it</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s not much more annoying in life than those small things that are seemingly insignificant but turn out to be extremely noticeable. Wonder what the heck I’m talking about?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I burned myself while eating a few days ago. And now it’s a bit of a cut (or something that feels like a cut) on the tip of my tongue. This can also be called an apical cut of the tongue. And it’s really annoying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everytime I move it against my teeth or eat something salty or anything at all, I’m reminded that it’s there. It’s like a little kid who keeps tapping you on the shoulder saying, “Here I am, play with me.” Not that playing with little kids is bad. So maybe it’s more like a little kid tapping you on the shoulder saying, “Here I am, clean up my poo.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what solution do I have for this? Nothing. I’ve got nothing. But here are some points that I’ve thought:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s on the tongue inside of your mouth so that eliminates the usual antiseptic and bandaging for cuts to the skin. Since the mouth is well-known to be full of germs, it is really unfortunate that they’re nothing that can be done about this. Maybe saliva protects it? Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s supposedly the strongest muscle. How do they know this? I have no idea. Whether it is or is not doesn’t matter so much as the fact that it is almost always moving. That makes it hard for the cut to really settled down, kick back, and recover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s necessary for eating. We can’t just bypass the tongue by sticking a feeding tube through our nose or veins, can we? Okay I guess that we could. But we won’t because that is just unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;How do people that bite their tongue in their sleep deal with this?!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;So you understand that a cut in the mouth must be annoying. But you know that there are a lot of other annoying things out there such as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cold sores. Especially if they’re big. Especially if they’re in the crack between your lip and your gum. Especially if you’re at a celebration banquet with lots of good food but which when put inside your mouth actually gets stuck in the cold sore and pokes it, aggravating it even more until you’re at the point of torture. Yeah that’s never happened to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paper cuts. A million of these would be absolutely unbearable torture. One of them is pretty bad, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pinched nerves/muscle knots. Whether you slept wrong, you exercised too much, or anything else that you did, these are so annoying as to make you think about them constantly for the day or two that they last. You almost can’t do anything but complain about it (whether out loud or in your head).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;So after all of this, the conclusion is that either I get annoyed very easily or there are a lot of annoying things out in the world.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Pull Your Pants Up, Boy</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/pull-your-pants-up-boy/"/> <updated>2007-10-05T13:40:13-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/pull-your-pants-up-boy</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alright so we had a fire drill the other day. And it was annoying. The sirens were piercingly loud. I guess that’s good because you don’t want to have your earphones in and listening to music so that you don’t hear the alarm when it goes off. Nevertheless the fact of the matter was that there wasn’t a fire and it did hurt my ears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you go down the stairs for the fire drill, it’s mild because nobody is actually trying to get away from a fire. I can only imagine that some people would panic in the case of a real fire and try to run by people. These are probably the same people that need to learn what I have to say &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/27/on-driving/&quot;&gt;On Driving&lt;/a&gt;. They’re the ones zooming by, cutting you off, and still getting to the destination not a minute or two faster than you. In a fire drill they’re gonna run as fast as they can, knock people over, and cause general pandemonium. Great.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But those thoughts weren’t the most disturbing of the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many people exited the building (it’s a 5 story one with multiple companies), and as we’re standing in the grass I see someone (from my company) who is standing there with his arms raised. They’re resting on his head. Maybe he was stretching. Maybe he was subtly trying to get someone’s attention. Maybe he was trying to touch the sky. How do I know? But whatever he was doing, all I know is that his shirt was too short (so it raised along with his arms), and his pants were sagging too much. And there was a great view of his man hair (if you know what I mean, pubic hair if you don’t) if you’re into that. But I’m not into that. Not at all. And I don’t know too many people who are. So that made me unhappy and disgusted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So remember, kids, to pull up your pants. Especially if you’re at work. Especially if you’re raising your arms up and trying to grab birds out of the air. You know who you are.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Contests With Prizes Are Great</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/contests-with-prizes-are-great/"/> <updated>2007-10-04T13:20:50-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/contests-with-prizes-are-great</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a little slow on this news, but one of the sites that I subscribe and read (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.problogger.net&quot;&gt;ProBlogger.net&lt;/a&gt;) is having a contest to celebrate the anniversary of his blog.

But I just wanted to let people know about some further information about using Blingo. Besides, it’s not as if this is going to be a series or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well it’s worth revisiting because:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got no comments on the last post. Not that I’m extremely popular but posts seem to get a fair amount of comments usually. Thus, I have no knowledge that anyone read it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a worthwhile thing to do because I feel like people only stand to benefit from utilizing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll admit it, I want you to join through me because I wouldn’t mind getting extra chances to win things. Who wouldn’t want that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, for those of you using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firefox.com&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; I have a tip for you. Now you can search Blingo in Firefox without ever having known the difference!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go to “about:config”. This stores all of the configurations (sometimes hidden, sometimes available through menus) of everything in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Change the keyword.enabled preference&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. In the &quot;Filter:&quot; text box, search for &quot;keyword.enabled&quot; 2. Right-click the entry with the Preference Name of &quot;keyword.enabled&quot; and click Toggle (make sure that the value is &quot;enabled&quot; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Change the keyword.URL preference&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. In the &quot;Filter:&quot; text box, search for &quot;keyword.URL&quot; 2. Double-click the entry with the Preference Name of &quot;keyword.URL&quot;. Change the value to &quot;http://www.blingo.com/search?q=&quot; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now hit Ctrl-L (hold Control and type the letter l) or Apple-L (Mac OS X) to access the URL bar. Type something not a website that you want to search for. Try “Derek Wong” if you’re unimaginative. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should be directed to the Blingo search results for “Derek Wong”!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is something that many people could benefit from. Using the keyboard to access the url bar instead of the mouse is faster as well as minimizing ergonomic issues by using the mouse. (If you didn’t know, increased and poor mouse usage contributes to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury&quot;&gt;Repetitive Strain/Stress Injuries&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also this will allow you to search the Internet through Blingo (whose benefits I’ve expounded upon in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/28/winning-with-blingo/&quot;&gt;Winning With Blingo&lt;/a&gt;) without having to actually go to the Blingo site each time!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blingo.com/friends?ref=owaPzC8r5HDSi1bTz8zecl_Z1hU&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.blingo.com/images/friendbuttons/200x75.8.blu.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Blingo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Winning With Blingo</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/winning-with-blingo/"/> <updated>2007-09-28T15:42:45-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/winning-with-blingo</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blingo.com/&quot;&gt;Blingo&lt;/a&gt; is a website search engine. You ask, “But there are tons of them out there, least of which Google, Yahoo!, etc.” Well this search engine is different because they give out prizes just for searching! A hoax you say? Well follow me as I take you on a picture tour of actually winning something!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1140/1454878422_156b25aee7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blingo_won_page&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the page that I came upon while doing a normal search.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1018/1454010355_c9106a06b6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blingo_prize&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here you see the page of instructions that I got in an e-mail from Blingo after submitting my information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1170/1454878338_d13077b81a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;amazon_applied&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I conveniently had an open, not-yet-shipped Amazon order that I could apply this gift certificate to. It works!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1355/1454793136_cd3857b7fd.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cropped_blingo&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here I am, famous on www.blingo.com and everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So want to know more about it than just what it looks like to win? Well I’m here to explain it to you (as I understand it from reading Blingo’s website anyways).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blingo takes your search query and performs and equivalent search on Google&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blingo receives results from Google and displays them to you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blingo also displays sponsored results like Google does&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blingo makes money on said sponsored results&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blingo buys some prizes with some of the money&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;At specified times, whoever performs a search closest to the time they will be presented with the page that I was presented with. You have won!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blingo doesn’t use all of the money on prizes, I’m sure. So they will make money, and you &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; win something&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s basically how Blingo works. So let me just tell you that I think that it’s very reasonable to participate with them. The way to approach it, though, is to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think that you would have searched Google anyways for whatever it is that you wanted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t expect to win because the odds of actually winning are minimal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, if you do win, then super!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t perform extra searches for extra entries because you’d likely be wasting unnecessary time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;So you can see why I would think that it’s worthwhile to try! And now that I won, it has solidified my use of it. They also have a neat affiliate program where you can sign up your friends. If someone that signed up through you wins, then you get the same exact prize. The winner’s prize is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; diminished, but the original winner and whoever referred them will get &lt;strong&gt;exactly the same prize&lt;/strong&gt;. If you’d like to sign up, then just click the button below. (I thought it looked like a man with a rifle. And I thought that was hilarious. Let’s name him Bob.) What that means is that if you win, I’ll just get a copy of what you win. So we’ll both win. Let’s win together!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blingo.com/friends?ref=owaPzC8r5HDSi1bTz8zecl_Z1hU&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.blingo.com/images/friendbuttons/200x75.8.blu.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Blingo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Running In Tempo</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/running-in-tempo/"/> <updated>2007-09-28T12:57:00-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/running-in-tempo</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Runner’s World Magazine, I recently read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-267--11909-0,00.html&quot;&gt;an article about tempo running&lt;/a&gt; that made me want to get back into the groove of running. Tempo running (also known as lactate-threshold or threshold running)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1149/1454476664_4846b1c5de_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kidrunners&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo courtesy of Flickr user &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/people/w2/&quot;&gt;W2 a-w-f-i-l&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until college, I always despised any running that I did. Whether for P.E. or for sports, it was always a chore that was done with little enjoyment. A necessary evil that we a prerequisite for the fun of something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then in college something changed. My fitness level was probably about the same so that wasn’t it. My location and life were obviously different. Whatever the reason was, though, I started to realize that running allowed me to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stay fit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get some fresh air&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Explore the area on foot rather than in a car&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spend some time alone in my thoughts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would run the loop around campus on a fairly regular basis. I even started to enter into a few races. What a turnaround from only a year or two before! In any case by the time that I left college I was fairly comfortable going out for runs for recreation and fitness purposes. In fact, I was even going out with other people occasionally for a little bit of socializing (in addition to the fitness benefit)!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So enough about the history of me and running. I started to recently run a little bit (only once or twice a week, mind you). However, after reading the article I was for some strange reason under an incorrect impression about tempo runs. I thought that they were run faster than they really are. I mean, “an 8 on a 1-to-10 scale” sounds pretty fast to me! But reading the rest of the article as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://runningtimes.com/rt/articles/?id=5615&amp;amp;page=2&amp;amp;c=85&quot;&gt;another article on tempo runs&lt;/a&gt; made me realize that it’s simply more of a steady consistent pace, albeit a pace faster than one might normally jog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I have been doing is running at a consistent pace but for only much shorter intervals. This week I ran 4 sets of 3:30 runs at probably about an 8 minutes/mile pace with a 60 second jog between sets. Let me tell you that it’s not easy! But I rather enjoy the challenge and am once again starting to enjoy the time alone, outside, and not in front of a computer (now that I’m in front of one the entire day for work).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure whether I’m going to continue this regime of running at a fairly brisk pace (but definitely NOT sprinting) for longer periods of time or whether I’m actually going to try a tempo run for 20 minutes. Whatever the case, I will continue the running as it is affording me benefits that I value.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Running is even more than just exercise, though. Have you thought of that? You can learn a lot about life from running. You can learn about yourself: are you persevering, are you stronger in mind than in body, are you even in shape? You can teach yourself to be independent and strong in mind. Running a race has been used as an analogy to life, and that’s because it is so true. How better to understand the analogy (and correspondingly life) than by running yourself?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So go. Do it. Just do it. (Does anyone remember Nike’s once ubiquitous slogan? Whatever happened to that? They went from simple to complex marketing in my opinion.)&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>17 Must Have Mac Apps</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/17-must-have-mac-apps/"/> <updated>2007-09-25T10:45:10-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/17-must-have-mac-apps</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/23/unboxing-my-macbook-pro/&quot;&gt;Unboxing My MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, I got right on getting my new computer setup the way that I wanted it. A big part of this is downloading and installing applications that I want to use. Macs are often purported to be ready to use out of the box. While generally true, there are many areas where I already knew of a application that I preferred to use over the installed one (if the installed functionality even existed). For those interested, I’ve included a list of the programs that I installed. Check it out and maybe you’ll find something useful for yourself!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh and I grouped the applications into categories so adding up the number to 17 might take a little bit of mental math on your part. Then again, you could just take my word for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Utilities&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/&quot;&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt; - A very popular application that allows you to access a lot of things through a single interface.

Found this easy-to-use program that will remove the localization files for all of your applications! Saved a couple of GB.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemacsoft.net/AppCleaner/&quot;&gt;AppCleaner&lt;/a&gt; - When you delete things on a Mac, they give you the impression that you’re completely done. That there’s no hassle of “uninstalling” programs like in other operating systems. But that’s not entirely true. They will actually leave things behind. Use this free application to completely remove applications when you want to get rid of them!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Productivity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openoffice.org/&quot;&gt;Open Office&lt;/a&gt; - This free cross-platform suite of office programs is great! This requires that X11 be installed as well, but in truth this is an excellent substitute for purchasing Microsoft’s suite. Check it out at least before purchasing MS Office for a large amount of money (compared to free).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Web&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; - The (now) ubiquitous open-source web browser is a must. I would try Camino (and I still might), but I love the extensions on Firefox too much at this point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adiumx.com/&quot;&gt;Adium&lt;/a&gt; - The Mac OS X port of the popular Gaim (now Pidgin) chat client.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberduck.ch/&quot;&gt;CyberDuck&lt;/a&gt; - A great FTP and SFTP browser. If you don’t know what FTP and SFTP are, then you won’t need this, but if you do then this is absolutely a good application to look into.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Programming&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/&quot;&gt;Xcode Developer Tools&lt;/a&gt; - A necessary first step if you want to develop applications for Mac OS X. It’s an Integrated Development Environment that I’ve only tinkered with to make some sample apps but with which I fully intend to use in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aquamacs.org/&quot;&gt;Aquamacs&lt;/a&gt; - My favorite text editor (Emacs) lives as a fully native port to Mac OS X. Nice. Really, really nice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://iterm.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;iTerm&lt;/a&gt; - Some nice features (tabbed sessions, bookmarks) to have on top of the default Terminal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Media&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gimp.org/macintosh/&quot;&gt;GIMP for Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; - The best full-featured, open-source image modification program I know. Needed to install X11 from the Install DVD, but that’s no big deal. Don’t think that they’re going to make a Cocoa version of this, but I just found &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.imendio.com/projects/gtk-macosx&quot;&gt;GTK+ for Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; so that GTK+ apps (like GIMP) can run the apps without X11. Maybe I’ll try to see if I can help out with that project…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&quot;&gt;VLC Media Player&lt;/a&gt; - This media player can handle anything and everything (okay almost) that you throw at it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ammesset.com/irecord/&quot;&gt;iRecord&lt;/a&gt; - Going to (haven’t yet) use this program to schedule and use my MBP as a Digital Video Recorder through my cable box. What does that mean? Hopefully being able to record HD content to my MBP! VLC is necessary for this task as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audacity.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Audacity&lt;/a&gt; - An excellent program for recording and modifying audio. Pretty necessary for me right now since I’m in the process of digitizing a good-sized vinyl record collection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://handbrake.m0k.org/&quot;&gt;Handbrake&lt;/a&gt; - A DVD ripper. Never used, but have heard lots about. Will be useful if I want to watch a DVD without taking the DVD with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll probably have another post about getting interested in setting myself up with programs that will help in utilizing cross-platform applications. Let me know if you have any others to add, and I’ll consider using it if it suits me. Found any of these to be useful and you hadn’t heard of them before? I’d love to hear (and I’m sure the developers of the applications would too!).&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Unboxing My MacBook Pro</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/unboxing-my-macbook-pro/"/> <updated>2007-09-23T17:30:33-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/unboxing-my-macbook-pro</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After following the MacBook Pro’s progress from before it even came out to the first edition with its problems aplenty to the future iterations that got better and better, here is the culmination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I initially started to get interested in the MBP once I realized that Mac OS X was much more than I had thought. It had pieces of BSD (a Unix foundation) and that seemed to me to be worthwhile. I wanted to see what it was like, and the MBP just became more and more attractive as I looked at it more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hopefully my waiting will pay off and my MBP will be trouble-free. Now by this time these kinds of things will not be very exciting to most people. there have been countless people who have done such posts and have tread this ground. But that is all by design because I don’t want to be one of the first (and almost by definition get all of the problems). In any case, here are the pictures. They’re not too interesting, but rest assured that I have some future related posts that may be more so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1064/1425024454_bf0609f1e1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Normal box&quot; /&gt; It looks so normal!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1346/1425021122_9cbd7e49f5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ah packaging&quot; /&gt; I’m glad that they make it as shock-resistant as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1342/1425021134_59e063a5e8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open up box&quot; /&gt; Goodies, goodies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1361/1426014713_050d03e9f8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MacBook Pro running&quot; /&gt; And we’re off!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Fun Error Messages</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/fun-error-messages/"/> <updated>2007-09-20T17:35:38-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/fun-error-messages</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes to get error messages.

They’re easy to do, so give ‘em a shot! It’s not a huge list of tips, but these are simply ones that I’ve thought of/started using recently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Navy Shower Directions:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Turn on water 2. Rinse 3. Turn off water 4. Lather and scrub 5. Turn on water 6. Rinse off 7. Turn off water 8. Enjoy the moment of the day that you will be the cleanest &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Save yourself water like the sailors had to do on ships. You’ll realize it’s not bad at all. I mean do you really need to have water being wasted while you scrub? I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Coasting in the car - When you’re driving around, think about the fact that only having two action options, accelerate and brake, could not be the most efficient. There is room for some other option: do nothing and let the laws of physics propel you. The momentum that you’ve previously gained can be utilized. All you need to do is be more aware of things going on around you. If there is a red light up ahead, take your foot off of both pedals and just let your car glide along. Positives while doing this are&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Less stress - Coasting, as in life, will let you relax 2. Save money - Not pressing the gas pedal will obviously not use gas and that is an obvious monetary savings 3. Have fun (and stay awake) - It&#39;s like a game to accurately figure out when to let off the gas in order to coast such that you won&#39;t have to brake at all. Great for when you&#39;re falling asleep, huh? 4. Eliminate congestion - I should write about this sometime, but coasting at a constant speed in congestion will not only get you to your destination in the same time, but it will actually start the elimination of said congestion! For those not totally self-centered, this can be seen as a huge positive. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Always turn off the light when you leave a room. No matter how long you’re gone, it has been verified (okay okay, by the great &lt;a href=&quot;http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html&quot;&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/a&gt;) that it’s more worthwhile to just turn off the light if you leave the room for ~20 seconds (I don’t remember the actual number).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pretty simple and straightforward, huh? Let me know what you think about ‘em in the comments. Or even better, give me some other tips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit: I totally forgot that when I was thinking of this post I actually meant to also say that these things will save you money but will also help save the environment!

I know this. You know this. But this video that I just saw confirms it.

Well if you haven’t, in short it is what allows you to memorize “google.com” rather than “72.14.207.99”. Every time you enter a website address into a browser, the browser first has to retrieve the actual numerical address (called an IP address) that corresponds to it so that it can actually access the website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A real-world analogy would be looking up a phone number in a telephone book. You likely don’t memorize everyone’s number. In fact, you probably don’t know all too many by heart. But you can easily remember someone’s name, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So each time you enter the address, your web browser has to ask a DNS server to give you the IP address. Very often, your ISP will have a DNS cache to more quickly give you the IP address.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something everyone should consider using is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendns.com/&quot;&gt;OpenDNS&lt;/a&gt;. It is a couple of DNS servers that are able to specify on your own computer to always use instead of whatever it is that you would otherwise use. Why is it good? Well OpenDNS offers things like safety from malicious websites (e.g. a misspelled website that causes you to arrive at a malicious website) and speed (likely from optimized servers) to name a few. Try it out, and see if you can notice a difference. I have and I do!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are instructions at the OpenDNS website for every operating system, and they take but a few minutes. *[IP]: Internet Protocol *[ISP]: Internet Service Provider *[DNS]: Domain Name System&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Yay For Frequent Commentators</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/yay-for-frequent-commentators/"/> <updated>2007-09-06T17:24:24-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/yay-for-frequent-commentators</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think that commenting is one of the most interesting and enticing things about an online blog. It allows one to share their thoughts, but it also allows others to give feedback on those thoughts! I like to comment on other blogs, but I also like to respond to comments on my own blog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So after participating a bit at &lt;a href=&quot;http://onemansblog.com&quot;&gt;One Man’s Blog&lt;/a&gt; (who is also having a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://onemansblog.com/2007/09/06/ombs-new-member-of-the-month-contest/&quot;&gt;contest for becoming a “member”&lt;/a&gt; of his site right now where he gives away something to the winner of a random drawing), and enjoying it very much I decided that I would do something similar to what he does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/10/no-nofollow/&quot;&gt;removing the nofollow&lt;/a&gt; on each and every commentator’s link, he instead creates a refreshed list of the top 10 commentators and provides them with a link back that way. I think that after seeing how I can sometimes be getting the single comments just to get a link, I think that this is a more prudent decision to minimize single-line “spammy” comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So therefore I am going to go for installing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pfadvice.com/wordpress-plugins/show-top-commentators/&quot;&gt;Show Top Commentators&lt;/a&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way to get onto the list is as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use the same information (name, e-mail, website) when leaving comments. It might be easiest to simply register (which I have opened up) on my website. You’ll be able to log in and not have to enter your information each time you leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leave comments! It’s fun anyways, I think to get to give feedback to the author (and be assured that authors do enjoy feedback, especially this author).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plugin will gather its data from the last 60 days, so be active else you fall and cease being the king of the mountain. Hm I always enjoyed that game (king of the mountain, not falling).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh an don’t worry, it will start immediately and retroactively use the comments that you’ve left. So we actually don’t start off with a clean slate, but I wouldn’t think that would be fair anyways to those that have graced me with their participation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m going to remove myself from any sort of communities for adding dofollow. I don’t really get too much traffic from them, and the traffic that I do get is usually people just leaving a single comment to get the link back to their site. I like the idea of adding dofollow, I just don’t like how it’s worked out for me thus far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Comments might not make the world go ‘round, but they sure are more pleasant than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Is The 40-30-20-10 Rule Too Ideal?</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/is-the-40-30-20-10-rule-too-ideal/"/> <updated>2007-09-04T10:28:20-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/is-the-40-30-20-10-rule-too-ideal</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many sources out there for how to get money, how to invest money, how to save money, and so on and so forth. But in reality, money is a fairly simple concept that seems to get muddled and complicated because people have such a vested interest in it. And because analysts want to keep their job of explaining the complex to the uneducated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically you earn money (or you find it, or you steal it, or whatever) so that is what is coming in, and then you spend it (or you give it away, or you lose it, you know) and that is what is going out. So what’s the best thing to do? Well spend less than you earn and you should do right fine. Makes sense huh?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A while ago I read about a basic rule for which one could ideally budget and limit one’s spending. It’s called the 40-30-20-10 rule for obvious reasons. The very quick among you would have already realized that those numbers add up to 100 and that would seem to represent 100% of your income. So what do the rest of the numbers represent?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;40 - Savings&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;30 - Necessary spending such as rent, food, bills, etc&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;20 - Free expenditure allowing any possibility of spending on entertainment, gifts, and otherwise unnecessary for living types of things&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;10 - Tithe&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I first read that, it seemed pretty easy and straightforward to me! However, I am wondering if it’s too easy to look at on paper but perhaps a bit too difficult in reality. How many people do you know who only live on 30% of their income? It sounds extremely conservative doesn’t it? You’d require a much better income just to be living an average lifestyle. Of course, I think that’s kind of the point of this budgeting scheme. However, I honestly don’t think that too many people could adhere to this type of drastic budgeting change from their own methods because they have come to expect a level of “luxury” in their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that this is a superb idea, and I will try to stick with it as much as I can. I’ve been working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/the-budgeteer/&quot;&gt;The Budgeteer&lt;/a&gt; (although that’s not what this post is really about), and I’ve been using this budgeting as my budgeting inputs. It’s been going alright thus far, and I actually have personally increased my savings category since my necessary expenditures are currently not as high. It’s nice, but I’m wondering if it’ll always be so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have many people heard of this plan?

I saw many instances of disgusting behavior that even more solidified my belief that people are just gross. Is it because I live in a fastidious society that elevates cleanliness to godliness? Perhaps it is. But it doesn’t matter because I am still grossed out by others no matter what the reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sneezing is a naturally occurring action. Our body responds like that because it is trying to rid itself of something that does not belong. Perhaps it is because we are sick and it’s trying to expel some germ-infested mucus. Or more than likely it is because there is some dust or other foreign particle caught inside of our body. So the body is doing a great thing when it reacts with a sneeze. However, there is no need to be at a swap meet and turn to the side to sneeze. The reason that there is no need for that is because there might be other people standing near there. And those people might not appreciate your nasty disgusting expelled mucus even close to them. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coughing is a similarly outstanding action that the body uses to save itself from harm. It can happen in order to keep the windpipe clear so that we can breathe. Well I guess it can also happen in order to signal someone about something. But that is not what I’m thinking of. I’m thinking of that hacking repeated cough that some are so inclined to do. You know where you don’t do that? At a buffet. A place where everyone essentially shares the same food. You don’t cough on your hand. You know why? It’s because you are going to use that same hand to get your food. That is sick. You also do not sneeze all over food. It doesn’t matter if you don’t like it. It doesn’t matter what you’re doing. You can feel it (it doesn’t sneak up on you) so please just put anything in your hand down so that you can cover up. That is even more sick! I hope that you don’t know what you are doing and what germs are because if you knew and still did it, you should be so ashamed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do not appreciate when people are inconsiderate. Have you ever noticed how easy it is for us (in general as people) to truly only care about ourselves? It’s our natural carnal tendency, whether you’d like to admit it or not. Some acknowledge this and try their darnedest to fight it. Some have been changed. And some just don’t care. I’d hope that I’m not the latter ranting and raving against my own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So next time you cough, sneeze, or in some other way do something that can affect others, think about what you’d want others to do. And put some hand sanitizer on that mess.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Tkinter Keyboard Bindings (In Python)</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/tkinter-keyboard-bindings-in-python/"/> <updated>2007-08-24T11:00:36-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/tkinter-keyboard-bindings-in-python</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I found this table useful, and I thought that I’d make it available for easier searching for those who might also look for it. It’s useful when creating a GUI with Tkinter in Python. I’m not really sure how much of that kind of development is going on, of course, but that’s beside the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways this is specific to the “special keys” that are used in the bind method for event handling, so I’ve not looked into where else this particular information could be useful. I, for one, used this in order to bind the enter key on the keypad to the same functions as the normal enter button. It was annoying me while using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/the-budgeteer/&quot;&gt;The Budgeteer&lt;/a&gt; because I couldn’t figure out what the name of the button to bind was. That has thankfully been remedied!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root = Tk() def hello(*ignore): print &#39;Hello World&#39; root.bind(&#39;&amp;lt;return&amp;gt;&#39;, hello) root.mainloop() &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;.keysym.keycode.keysym_numKey&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alt_L 64 65513 The left-hand alt key&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alt_R 113 65514 The right-hand alt key&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BackSpace 22 65288 backspace&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cancel 110 65387 break&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Caps_Lock 66 65549 CapsLock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Control_L 37 65507 The left-hand control key&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Control_R 109 65508 The right-hand control key&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Delete 107 65535 Delete&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Down 104 65364 ↓&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;End 103 65367 end&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Escape 9 65307 esc&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Execute 111 65378 SysReq&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;F1 67 65470 Function key F1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;F2 68 65471 Function key F2&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fi 66+i 65469+i Function key Fi&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;F12 96 65481 Function key F12&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Home 97 65360 home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Insert 106 65379 insert&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Left 100 65361 ←&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Linefeed 54 106 Linefeed (control-J)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_0 90 65438 0 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_1 87 65436 1 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_2 88 65433 2 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_3 89 65435 3 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_4 83 65430 4 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_5 84 65437 5 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_6 85 65432 6 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_7 79 65429 7 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_8 80 65431 8 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_9 81 65434 9 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Add 86 65451 + on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Begin 84 65437 The center key (same key as 5) on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Decimal 91 65439 Decimal (.) on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Delete 91 65439 delete on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Divide 112 65455 ↓ on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Down 88 65433 on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_End 87 65436 end on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Enter 108 65421 enter on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Home 79 65429 home on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Insert 90 65438 insert on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Left 83 65430 ← on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Multiply 63 65450 * on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Next 89 65435 PageDown on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Prior 81 65434 PageUp on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Right 85 65432 → on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Subtract 82 65453 - on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KP_Up 80 65431 ↑ on the keypad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next 105 65366 PageDown&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Num_Lock 77 65407 NumLock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pause 110 65299 pause&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Print 111 65377 PrintScrn&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prior 99 65365 PageUp&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Return 36 652933 The enter key (control-M).

Now for many, this is a nebulous term that doesn’t really mean much to them until it results in a program that allows them to accomplish something. And that’s just fine. But what is interesting is that there is a methodology to software development that is actually pretty useful in everyday living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be a software developer to appreciate ideas that will make your life easier or better now, do you? So don’t be scared if you’ve never heard the terms, just think about the ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, these are just a few of the ideas that I’ve thought were useful:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Leave lots of notes (well-commented code) **- Just as in coding, you (should) know what you’re doing at the exact moment that you’re doing it. However, how many times do we do something and then either leave it undone or pick it up again at another time. A prime example of this are those leftovers in the fridge. You threw them into the refrigerator last night after dinner just to get things cleaned up. Then you go get some groceries, put them in, and happen to push those leftovers to the back of the shelf. You find a tupperware in a few days and you are not really sure what it is or how old it is. A good comment from yourself when you had put it into the fridge would help you quite a bit right now wouldn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let objects perform functions that they were intended for (object-oriented programming)&lt;/strong&gt; - How big are the toasters with lcd screens? How much do you want a pot that has a handle with the temperature as well as a clock, an alarm, and a remote control? Sure you could scoff at such ideas, but in reality it’s much more efficient to use objects for their intended purpose. When objects have specific functions, you will immediately know what object to use when it comes time to perform a particular task. Don’t try to open a bottle with a screw driver, you can get diseases from the rusty nail that you were screwing in the garage the other day. Don’t use the same sponge to clean the counter as the dishes that you eat off of for the same reason. Using objects for purposes other than their intended one can not only make you look cheap, it can introduce errors that you would not have thought of. Also they’re better than huge, all-encompassing programs/objects because when some part of it breaks it is easier to fix and there is less loss of function. The television with speakers, a subwoofer, a built-in dvd player, a vcr, audio receiver-like capabilities and numerous other parts is more likely to be completely useless if one of those parts breaks than individual components, is it not?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Fix when needed, upgrade when necessary (don’t get left behind the ages with nasty-to-maintain code) **- When something breaks, you have choices. You can get it repaired to the state that it was before or you can upgrade and buy something. So I guess you have a few choices in what to buy as well. You can buy used or new. In software development, there are many tools that you can use. There are code editors, programming languages, and many other tools. There is an unfortunate tendency for some, just as in life probably, to hold on to the old tools and languages simply because that’s how it’s always been. Sometimes we need to take a step back and re-evaluate the state that we are in and whether it is worth it to move on to something bigger and better. It’s not worth it to keep that old junker of a car if the repair costs cost more than a brand new automobile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand how something works rather than specific tasks (similar to concept programming)&lt;/strong&gt; - Do not limit your knowledge to specifics. Understand the driving force behind the specifics and then the specifics will become clear. This is a rather basic idea that translates to all types of fields. However, in my opinion, it seems to hold a lot of weight in the programming world because there are very many different ways to express the same idea. Notably, programming language choice can very easily decide how a particular goal will be achieved. In the real world, if you want to program a &lt;abbr title=&quot;Video Cassette Recorder&quot;&gt;VCR&lt;/abbr&gt;, it is much more useful to understand what you’re doing (setting a timer and settings on the &lt;abbr title=&quot;Video Cassette Recorder&quot;&gt;VCR&lt;/abbr&gt; in order to turn on and start recording) rather than simply memorizing the sequence of buttons to press in order to set the timer. It’s going to be pretty tough if you suddenly purchase a &lt;abbr title=&quot;Digital Video Recorder&quot;&gt;DVR&lt;/abbr&gt; and you don’t really understand what you’re trying to do with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>And...That's A Wrap</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/andthats-a-wrap/"/> <updated>2007-08-18T18:53:43-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/andthats-a-wrap</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reading never gets old. Well not to me at least. It’s something that I’ve enjoyed during my life, and it’s something that I make a point out of continuing to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, I just finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-reading/the-foundation-trilogy-by-isaac-asimov/&quot;&gt;The Foundaction Trilogy by Isaac Asimov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why is reading books never old (in comparison to reading things online)?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re available even if there is no electricity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can take them anywhere, even if there is no Internet connection there!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re sometimes more readily accessible than reading things online. Try searching for copies of all of the classics freely available online.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You get cultured when you read them. How else will you know where famous sayings and quotes come from if you don’t actually read them? It’ll make you look less ignorant when someone uses a quote from a book and you’ve already read that book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It gives you an aspect of your life that is actually changing. Even if everything around you seems to be droning on in the same old manner, at least you’ll be able to talk about how the book that you’re reading has been exciting (or not) to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You look more well-balanced to other people. Someone who is reading looks a lot more balanced than someone who is staring at a computer screen all of the time, wouldn’t you say?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do a lot of people still read? I have no idea. I was also tempted to put something related to decreasing chances for poor eyesight, but I don’t actually know if that’s true or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was a lot longer than I had envisioned that post being.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>New (Hopefully Better) Favicon</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/new-hopefully-better-favicon/"/> <updated>2007-08-17T11:01:09-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/new-hopefully-better-favicon</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I finally replaced the favicon for my website. I suppose that it’s been on my TODO list but at a low priority. So low that I didn’t even remember it. Someone bringing it up will definitely bump that baby up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I decided to replace the favicon that was either&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;A piece of poo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;A faucet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;A faucet of poo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The letter P&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The road representing the path that the wong way is&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously everyone thought it was the last choice. In any case, I went for a little different approach. Now even though I’m no pro at creating images, I was still able to make one and put it up (as I said in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/13/favicons/&quot;&gt;Favicons&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time I went for a couple of arrows. At first I was going to put multiple arrows going one way and a single arrow going the other. However, it looked pretty junky when I converted it to a tiny picture. So I decided that enough with the nasty favicons, I’m just going with something simple. So there you have it, take it how you will. At least it doesn’t look like a piece of poo anymore.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Better Folder/File Structure</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/better-folderfile-structure/"/> <updated>2007-08-15T10:44:16-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/better-folderfile-structure</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On one’s computer, everyone has a structure. Some are more organized and some are not. Some have files in a very hierarchical form while others will save files willy-nilly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that I used to be more of the latter but have more recently moved towards the former. And that’s a good thing. It probably has to also do with how I want to be neater with my physical possessions as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the ideas that I’ve keyed off:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the date&lt;/strong&gt; - I will create filenames that are similar to each other for a particular folder and then just append YYMMDD to the end (and possibly HHMMSS if need be). If you don’t know, that means that I append the last 2 digits of the year, the 2 digit month, and the 2 digit day. I suppose that I should learn from the whole Y2K fiasco that I should use YYYY to truly be safe, but I don’t really think a lot of my stuff is going to matter when I’m gone. Because I’m pretty sure that I will be gone by the time the dial rolls around to 2100. In any case, this method gives you a reliable way to sequentially order your files. The time stamp that operating systems have on files is a little bit unreliable since it can change simply by modifying and saving the file. I especially use this for things such as copies of payment for monthly bills, program backups, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have multiple levels of folders&lt;/strong&gt; - In other more technical terms, have multiple layers of abstraction. It sounds complicated perhaps, but it’s a good thing. A really good folder structure will infinitely help your access to particular files. For example, storing music is much easier when I have used the folder structure: Artist-&amp;gt;Album-&amp;gt;(music files). Previously I have done many methods including all in one folder, by type, and willy-nilly. None of those worked particularly well when I wanted to find something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a temporary folder&lt;/strong&gt; - Use this folder to save anything that you might want for now, but won’t be a huge loss to you if it gets deleted. A short-term place of storage if you will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be as specific as possible&lt;/strong&gt; - For my pictures, I store everything in folders according to the event or time that they were taken. I think that optimally I would be able to name all of my pictures exactly as I see fit with the pictures’ content in the filename. However, I don’t care enough to spend that much time. Still it’s very useful to store things by as specific a means as possible (in this case the event is as specific as possible).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay for now that’s all I’ve got. But I’m sure that over the years I’ll incorporate other ideas into how I set up my computer’s file structure. Any new ideas are definitely welcome!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>On The Other Hand</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/on-the-other-hand/"/> <updated>2007-08-13T08:30:45-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/on-the-other-hand</id> <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be as adamant when wrong as you are when right. -Derek Wong&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I might not be there.

Some games I like more than others. I’m particularly a fan of word games even though I don’t get to play them all too much nowadays. I like games that involve decision making because that increases the possibility of losing. I like some card games, but I’m no gambling bo. (Why bo? Why not?)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hmtk.com&quot;&gt;Ramblings From The Marginalized&lt;/a&gt;, Steve has just created &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hmtk.com/archives/quartile.html&quot;&gt;Quartile&lt;/a&gt;. Yes that’s right, he made the game. That is pretty amazing, I think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So looking at the game, it seems pretty interesting, even if the concept is a bit simple. It seems to me to be a mix of Scrabble and dominos where instead of piecing together words with letters, you place seemingly domino pieces in arithmetically corresponding spaces. I must admit that it even seems simple when I write that, but that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t also look enjoyable! Just look at the Wii, it’s doing so well because it purports to be a simple to use gaming system that focuses on fun rather than complexity!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, he has this pretty cool offer to give away one of his prototype marble sets.

For quite some time I have thought that they (along with elderly) are absolutely hilarious. They have no qualms about acting in whatever manner they want because they just don’t care what others think about them. And I really like that because they’re being real to themselves. They’ll do socially unacceptable things, they’ll say things that others would be scared to say. They’ll let loose a fart in public that’s loud and smelly, they’ll criticize someone for the way that they’re dressed, and so on and so forth. That’s funny to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, just the other day I went to the San Diego Zoo and saw some children that caused me to realize that this let loose, carefree attitude was also good to see things that were more important than humor. It allowed me to see what kind of people they really were. As children, it allowed me to see how they were being raised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children are a product of parenting, that is obvious. They are raw and they don’t know about society when they come out of the womb. They must be taught about it, molded into a shape that is acceptable. Sometimes parents are not good. Okay, I’m sure that very often parents are not good. They mess kids up and we get a world full of bitter, messed up kids in need of some psychoanalysis, a hug, and perhaps some discipline. And thus, here is how to go the Wrong Way in raising a child (based very briefly on a some observations throughout a day):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;First off, don’t worry about ethnicity. You can raise a horrible child no matter your skin tone or where on earth you are from. It’s possible, you can do it so go ahead and try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;(For the white kid) Let your kid do whatever he wants. Sure he needs some discipline. Sure he needs to listen to the rules of the bus to not stand on the seat, but he really just wants to see everything. So it’s okay, when you want him to sit down for his own good and he pushes away your hands, be gentle and loving. When he turns around and smacks you across the face, say “that’s okay.” When your mother (his grandmother) wants to discipline him, just tell her to back off because she’s antagonizing him and that’s causing a ruckus. Relax, your kid is going to turn out just fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;(For the black kid) You need to allow them to do whatever they want. If they see a toy, they’ll think it’s like the ones that they have at home. Oh you let them break them at home? Oh sure, then you should just let them try to break them everywhere else also. Then you realize that’s not okay in public and you tell them otherwise. Good good, mixed signals to a child will definitely help them to learn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;(For the Hispanic kid) It’s a good idea to just clean up after your kid. Make sure that he lives in a clean house, but do not ever think to force him to clean up after himself. He’ll always have you around to clean up after him, anyways. So that’s perfect, because when he is messing around by himself at say the zoo, then he’ll expect it to be the same as at home. He’ll take his juice wrapper, throw it on the ground, kick it around, and ultimately pick it up and throw it at an animal cage when you’re not watching. He will litter and run away as if that were perfectly normal. The trash can right near him? He doesn’t even know what that is because you’ve always just done everything for him. Ah there, you have raised a polite and reasonable child. Good job!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;(For the Asian kid) When you want your way, talk really loud. Do that at home with your family, too. Other people will only know that you want something when you’re loudly vocal about it. She’ll learn the same. So when you’re walking around, she’s wailing in a monstrously loud fashion about her desires because that’s how she knows to tell you something. And inconveniently you’re not going to want to abide right then. So just keep on going let her continue her wailing. She’ll think that the louder she gets, the more likely she’ll get it. Don’t instruct her otherwise. Very likely it’s true that she can be very loud, and you’re going to give in to her later on. She’ll learn eventually that she can’t always get her way. Someone else will teach her. She’ll learn eventually that she can’t scream as loud as she possibly can in public for prolonged periods of time. She’ll learn that your silence is actually your love, caring, and devotion to her. She’ll learn all of that, I’m positive about that!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children are an amazing thing. But they’re not going to be perfect and cute all of the time. One needs to have a little bit of planning, knowledge, and purpose in order to raise them. After seeing how horribly others can do, I think that I’d be a little bit more scared to raise one on my own. Very, very scared.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Lovely Junk Or Useful Pain</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/lovely-junk-or-useful-pain/"/> <updated>2007-08-03T10:10:56-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/lovely-junk-or-useful-pain</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While cleaning up, one begins to find objects accumulated over the years that are of a few varieties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is the out and out junk that is immediately tossed. That’s the easy stuff. The wrappers, the broken toys, the school work that is no longer pertinent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then there is the the items that hold significance but are not really too useful. Those are the cherished toys and so on that at one time were loved, but are no longer. These often will get kept for sentimental reason or donated so that another could love it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Along the same vein, there are those items that were very amusing but for a much briefer amount of time than the previous category. In my mind I see the gag gifts, the awards, and the other one-time items that were cherished but for a moment but are now essentially trash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contrast this with those items that were dearly beloved before but are now regarded with a bit of distaste. Perhaps these are gifts given by an old flame or a long-lost friend. In that moment and for some time afterwards the item was important, but as a result of happenings in your relationship with the other person(s) involved it has changed its meaning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what is more worthwhile, a piece of (essentially) junk that holds memories of a grand time or an item that is actually useful but holds more bitter memories?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am not one to pack like a rat, but I like to keep special things. I actually think that I would opt to save the latter over the former even though I would enjoy the former more often. The hard things make us who we are, and I like to remember where I came from. The journey is important.

Weblogging. We blogging. Oh yeah we’re blogging!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do we do it? Why do I do it? It’s such an interesting phenomenon. People have been writing in journals and diaries for years and years. But those always seemed to be meant to be secret. Along come computers and the Internet and all of a sudden there are people who have a desire to write things in a completely public forum. What is the attraction? I know that I have met people who have asked just these questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; I do it? Well I think that a large attraction for me is to be able to freely express myself in whatever way I want. I can say something and not be graded or judged (okay I guess that you could judge me in some ways) based on it. I am able to say what I want when I want. I can rant about the guy that bugs me or I could talk about the small pleasures of life. Some people have their radio shows, others have their newspaper columns. But for the average Joe, what public forum is available to express the joys and outrages of life? Aren’t our opinions as worthy (if not as well voiced) as those more famous opinion expressers?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rory over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cleancutblog.com/&quot;&gt;Clean Cut Blog&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cleancutblog.com/group-writing-project-what-is-your-first-rule-of-writing/&quot;&gt;Group Writing Project&lt;/a&gt; that is intended to allow many people to write about what their absolute first rule of writing is. I was reminded of it after reading Shelly’s post &lt;a href=&quot;http://thiseclecticlife.com/2007/07/27/fishing-for-an-audience/&quot;&gt;Fishing For An Audience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So after thinking about my reasons for even having a blog, I realize that I’ll only do it when &lt;strong&gt;it is interesting to me&lt;/strong&gt;. That seems rather obvious, but it very accurately describes what I do with this blog and why I do what I do. That is why this blog is not like others. Hopefully that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; why it’s not the most popular blog on the Internet. I mean, I’d like to think that what I am interested in has some appeal to other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, although there are many many good blogs out there and the popular opinion is that they should focus on a particular area, I think that I like to keep this blog a place where I can show people how I go my own way. You know, the wong way. And each time I write a post, that is what I keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>A 37" TV Would Do Quite Nicely Right Here</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-37-tv-would-do-quite-nicely-right-here/"/> <updated>2007-07-28T22:29:27-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-37-tv-would-do-quite-nicely-right-here</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I definitely enjoy entering contests.

My co-worker brought some a couple of bags of them in to work recently and we got the special privilege of getting to try them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are a special release and as such they have special flavors. Everything from grass to pickle to black pepper and booger. However, none of that can compare to a couple of the ones that I tried.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d like to think that I’m willing to try many things. I have no desire to try everything once, mind you. I have no desire to try things that might necessarily place my life/freedom/health in jeopardy. But I still fancy myself a bit adventurous, and I’d like to think that I’m willing to try many things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1391/896714327_fc561b0d3c_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bertie_botts_flavor_guide&quot; /&gt;So I tried some especially fun flavors such as vomit and sardine. However, by and far the worst flavor that I tried was rotten egg. &lt;strong&gt;Rotten egg&lt;/strong&gt;. Who thinks of such things?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So my co-workers and I were trying different flavors in the mindset of doing them together. Nobody likes to things alone, and just as I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/12/im-willing-if-you-are/&quot;&gt;I’m Willing If You Are&lt;/a&gt; doing things side by side with another peson is an effective psychological tool. So after taking turns at trying different flavors and meeting with relative disgust, we decided to all try the rotten egg flavored jelly bean at once. We each picked out jelly beans according to the guide, but when we tried it we all discovered that we had in fact chosen the much better lemon drop flavor. Then I decided that I only live an earthly life once, so I still tried it even while my co-workers tried other things. And as I slowly chewed and let the saliva transmit the flavor to my taste buds, I began to become quite disgusted. The flavor and the stench conspired to cause me to gag. I coughed a few times, and I must say that I really felt a couple of moments of almost wanting to puke. It was so gross. It’s amusing that it was in fact grosser than the vomit taste itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, I’ve tried it and I don’t intend on trying it ever again. But please, I would be more than happy to have you try it. It’s not as if you have been there and done it. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m really really really really really glad they did not choose to make a jelly bean that was flavored as sour milk. I think that would have guaranteed puking from many adventurous souls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that flavor tester for these nasty Bertie Bott’s Jelly Beans has got to be on the list of the worst jobs. Imagine tasting vomit every single day at work. And not just everyday, but constantly. Oh man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;That morning of trying nasty tastes was filled with hilarity. Paramount was when an unsuspecting co-worker believed another who said that a jelly bean was an innocuous fruit flavor when it was in fact vomit-flavored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Apple:Geeks :: Coach:Girls</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/applegeeks-coachgirls/"/> <updated>2007-07-22T20:45:19-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/applegeeks-coachgirls</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well first off, it’s not totally all-inclusive and definitive to say that only geeks want Apple computers or that all girls want coach purses. But you know what, for now that will be the title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secondly I took this idea from those old SAT analogy questions. Sick as it may be, I rather enjoyed the SAT. It was challenging without being impossible. Plus every time I took it (I only took it once “for real”), it was different. Whether that meant different passages to read and answer from or different math questions, I enjoyed that it was a new challenge that I hadn’t exactly encountered yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, those were definitely unimportant asides. I really want to just say that I think that Apple is keeping their prices artificially high in order to appeal to a certain part of the market. They want to be the ultimate that everyone desires. They want to be what Coach purses are to girls. Okay okay you can choose any of the myriad of popular expensive brands of purses, but I just needed an example. And that seems to be a popular one nowadays.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coach is a company that produces leather goods and sells them on a very high profit margin. Economists have hypothesized that they are selling “affordable luxury” that is both recognizable as a luxury product while also being reasonably within the budget of many people. That is to say that it’s thought to be “nice” and it’s also well-known to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple is the same thing to geeks (and artists and movie makers and perhaps even all computer users).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite your opinions, I’d say that you must admit that Apple has a well thought-out business model. They customize software (including the operating system) to work very well on their devices. I’m mainly speaking about their computer here rather than their other devices, but I suppose that it holds for those as well. So they are determined to do something and do it well. They will sell very few product lines, and they are not determined to be able to support everything under the sun like Microsoft is with their Windows product. Have you ever thought about how much easier that makes their job? They know exactly what they must do while Microsoft has to build a product that is so good that it can conquer “the unknown.” If Apple were unable to get something to work just right with their goal, they could just say “forget it” and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And upon this business model, Apple has kept their prices high. They sell good products, but they charge a premium for them as well. And seeing as how they have increased their market share from 3.2% to 7.6% in 3 years (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/apple_mac_grabs_76_home_computer_market_share_iphone_to_sell_100m_per_year/&quot;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;), something is working for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personally, I’ve been keeping an eye on the Macbook Pro for the entire time that it’s been out (and probably even as soon as rumors started circulating that it was going to be produced). I was eager to see what Apple was going to do with that platform. I knew that there would be problems with such new technology (and I was proved correct with the plethora of reports from the first few generations but I digress). I do intend to still buy one. But just for curiosity’s sake I recently priced laptops from both Dell and Lenovo. I was able to get hardware that was as good (or better) and at cheaper prices. It was fairly dramatic to say the least.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does that mean? It means that Apple laptops are also “affordable luxury.” It means that you don’t need one. You could get a very usable functioning laptop for thousands less. Or similarly you could use the same amount of money and get a laptop with more cutting edge components. But because Apple keeps their prices high, people will always hold them on a pedestal. They will be the ideal instead of just a choice. And that works out just fine for Apple. But just like I don’t understand the whole deal with buying fancy purses (saying “it’s quality” just doesn’t cut it all of the time), I’m not sure if I’m totally comfortable with Apple all of the time. I think that on a case by case basis I would advise people to honestly figure out what they need. And i think that many times that will lead to the conclusion that Apple is not the place for them. Yeah, if I were a girl I might just be that one with the homemade bag on her shoulder.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Buffets Cannot Be Good For You</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/buffets-cannot-be-good-for-you/"/> <updated>2007-07-19T13:23:51-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/buffets-cannot-be-good-for-you</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now I enjoy a buffet just as much as the next person. They’re usually a pretty good value in terms of how much food you get for your dollar. However, the other day when I was at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oldcountrybuffet.com/&quot;&gt;Hometown Buffet&lt;/a&gt;, I noticed a few things that I thought were interesting while I was there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of obese people at buffets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel really heavy afterwards and even the next morning compared to how I normally feel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of food that goes into you…and comes out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was sweaty and felt warm even though the weather was cool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could have eaten 1 plate and have been satisfied. Instead I ate 4 plates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was thinking (and discussing over dinner) that buffets seem to be very indicative of society. There is a huge problem with obesity and our eating habits are only part of that. But just go to a buffet and see how many of the people there have a personal problem with obesity. It’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even beyond that, I felt really sorry for the kids. Children don’t do things of their own volition, they are taught and raised by their parents. So when there is an obese child, I’d go so far as to say that the parents have caused them to be that way. And that is so unfortunate. Sure I have to take into account that different people have different metabolisms, etc. Nevertheless, nobody has to be that obese. Anyways, back to the point. So parents have chosen for their kids to live in obesity and unhealthily. That is so much more tragic because it is almost upon them without them being able to do much about it. I have much less empathy for adults who are in a similar situation because they know what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So there it is. Buffets are good. They taste good. You get to eat whatever you want. But they’re not really too good for you. Go eat some fruit.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Footlocker Coupon Found, And What?</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/footlocker-coupon-found-and-what/"/> <updated>2007-07-17T11:04:04-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/footlocker-coupon-found-and-what</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I think that one interesting effect of the Internet is the ability for people to find out for themselves what a good price is. There are a plethora of websites out there that can do different things for you. There are sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fatwallet.com&quot;&gt;fatwallet&lt;/a&gt; that allow you to make some money off of your purchases, there are plenty like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gotapex.com&quot;&gt;gotapex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slickdeals.net&quot;&gt;slickdeals&lt;/a&gt; that will point you in the right direction for big deals, and there are even sites that will help you find coupons. You could search on google and definitely come up with coupons for particular stores that you want to buy from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve seen all types of websites that will offer this for you. Many of them are good even if they are frequented by essentially the cheapskates of the land. But they let their money go further, and that’s not a bad thing. I happened onto a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webbyplanet.com/deals/coupon-footlocker/&quot;&gt;Webbyplanet footlocker&lt;/a&gt; coupon that seemed to be on a site that one could go to where the coupons are consolidated. They separate the stores by category, and it seems like their site is fairly simple enough. It allows you to access the information that you want to get to without too much surfing, and it’s nice that they’re not trying to endlessly spam you with advertisements in order to get to what you want. I’m not sure that I really like the look of the styling of the site what with the colors, but I suppose that’s always going to be a judgment call.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the Footlocker coupon, I’ve had experience with ordering from Footlocker’s site first hand. I have actually ordered a few pairs of athletic shoes from them, and I’ve found the experiences to be quite painless. Although I did once order some cleats with their express shipping, and it didn’t come in time. But then it took so long that it passed their guarantee so I actually got the shipping free. And that’s not half bad! I’ve noticed that the best times to buy are when they have their “friends and family” deal or when they have their clearance sales. Just beware then if you wear anything besides very small or very large shoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways so after all of these strange random thoughts, the moral is this: spend some time to use your resources!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>On Bathroom Behavior</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/on-bathroom-behavior/"/> <updated>2007-07-13T15:29:39-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/on-bathroom-behavior</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know me, I like going the wong way. Even in the bathroom. Want to go the wrong way? Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carry on a long conversation with others. Because that’s where socializing should take place. Nobody wants some peace and quiet, they want to get to know you while they’re relieving themselves. Or maybe they want to overhear you talking with someone else. Anyways, it’s even worse when they’re talking to you and you’re both doing some business. It’s even worse if you’re both at urinals. It’s even worse if they look at you. It’s even worse if there’s no wall between the urinals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Splash human waste around. You know, get it on the floor, the walls, wherever you can. Because it’s not full of diseases. Besides, it’s funny. And there’s no price too small for a laugh! And no aiming! Let others step in your waste. We like it. No scratch that, we love it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Write obscene messages on the wall. Because everyone likes to hear what goes on in the minds of the underbelly of society. We want to know how you feel about your reproductive organs. We also want to know how you feel about politics. Really, that is the only reason that we’re in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t wash your hands. It takes too much time. It’s too much of a hassle. And you’re a clean person, so it’s a waste anyways. Oh and it’s beneficial because it saves water. Everyone wins. Everyone. Of course, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/22/what-to-think/&quot;&gt;What (am I) To Think?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t eat fiber. It makes you have to poo everyday. And that is just not productive. You might as well wait 2 or 3 days and then get all of the pooing done at once. If it clogs the toilet, oh well! Someone will fix it. You’re actually giving them a job to do by clogging up the toilet. You’re supporting someone’s family! Do the good deed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get other things done while you’re sitting on the pot. Browse your Blackberry, read the newspaper, floss your teeth. Do what you need to do to make that time more productive. Yeah that’s not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/07/a-scary-thought/&quot;&gt;A Scary Thought&lt;/a&gt;, is it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leave trash all around. Waste more toilet seat covers than you need. Yank on that toilet paper. (For girls) leave those female hygiene products everywhere but the waste basket where they belong. Like I said, that’s someone else’s job. You’re helping out society by lowering unemployment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;So my experiences are a little colored since I don’t go into the women’s bathroom all too often. But you know what? I think that the facts hold true there, too. So you can follow these ideas, but then you’ll be going the wrong way. As for me, I think that I’ll keep it clean and sanitary while I go the wong way.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Automatic Updates Will Automatically Mess You Up</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/automatic-updates-will-automatically-mess-you-up/"/> <updated>2007-07-11T11:01:40-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/automatic-updates-will-automatically-mess-you-up</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As if users did not make enough errors on their own, Microsoft is making life even more troublesome. I’d like to know whose bright idea it is/was to automatically restart your computer after the automatic updates! Oh sure, they give you a random pop-up message that essentially says “push this button or we’ll blow up your computer.” And it will appear for about 1 minute. So don’t you get up thinking that you’d like to go to the bathroom or anything like that. Nix the coffee breaks or the fresh air that you might like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somehow they assume that you are not doing anything important. They don’t save the status of anything nor do they give you the option to opt out completely from automatic restarts. There’s a fine line between doing things for the benefit of the user and annoying them to no end such that they want you to just quit what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It annoyed me before, and it continues to do so.

And that is getting to be outside of a building.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a software engineer, whatever that means. Well I know what that means, but you don’t really care about it anyways. In any case that means that I spend much of my day sitting in a chair in front of a computer. There are some good and bad things about this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t waste too much energy, not difficult physically. &lt;strong&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt;: Can easily take in more calories than output which leads to fatness and an unhealthy lifestyle. Additionally, muscles can slowly atrophy such that when presented with a life or death situation where you need to grab onto a bar and hold up both you and your loved ones with one arm, you will all fall to an untimely demise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;: Do something that you enjoy - problem solving, thinking logically about solutions to somewhat concrete (but not real concrete) problems. &lt;strong&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt;: Get lazy and don’t experience the other many many other good things in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t get sunburned, don’t get skin cancer. &lt;strong&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt;: Look like a pale alien unless you actually go out. However, due to being inside and being so pale it would be even easier to get sunburned if sunscreen is forgotten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, I don’t want to be that person that is always inside and becomes lazy. Good thing for trees that overgrow their boundaries and require chopping!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh yeah I was outside over the weekend cutting branches off of trees that were touching the roof. And you know what? It wasn’t too bad. I felt like a woodsman. It’s not going to be a job of mine anytime soon, but I don’t mind finding a little Paul Bunyan in me.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Not What I Do</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/not-what-i-do/"/> <updated>2007-07-05T10:16:23-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/not-what-i-do</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you ever think that so much of the time, conversations with other people consist of talking about what you do? Whether that means talking about what is going on in school, your current job situation, events that you’ve gone to, and so on, it’s always rather based on past experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And do people read into it and see who you really are? Well probably sometimes they do. Nevertheless, it’s very likely that only your closer friends can actually talk about other things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you talk to someone and you have to tell them what you do for a living, you know it’s not going to be a mind-blowing conversation. Especially if it’s because you broached the subject after running out of other things to say. It’s even worse if you have to talk about the weather.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Busyness</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/busyness/"/> <updated>2007-07-03T09:44:43-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/busyness</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You, the one with the Bluetooth headset in your ear.

Besides, I’m always up for a new idea for a post!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each player must post these rules first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each player starts with eight random facts/habits about themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who are tagged need to write their own blog about their eight things and post these rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of your blog, you need to choose eight people to get tagged and list their names.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to leave them a comment telling them they’re tagged, and to read your blog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are the eight!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I played badminton in high school. It’s not your average backyard game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have more in common with Michael Bolton than one would think. No, not that one, the one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space&quot;&gt;Office Space&lt;/a&gt; fame. And he’d be angry that you thought of that one first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before sitting on the toilet in a public restroom to do my business, I’m not satisfied with the toilet seat covers that they provide. So I put that one on first, then use about 10 squares of toilet paper to make sure that there is no butt-toilet seat contact happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tried to read &lt;em&gt;A Tale Of Two Cities&lt;/em&gt; when I was in 4th grade. I gave up at about Chapter 3. I guess that I wasn’t as advanced as I thought!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoy thrift shopping so much that I would estimate that I have at least 20 articles of clothing purchased from said thrift stores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;In high school I took a photography class where we got to shoot pictures using a film SLR and perform the entire process from shooting to developing to printing (and even mounting!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve never been stung by a bee (or wasp or hornet or anything else that flies and has a stinger)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of this moment, I have over 22 GB of music.

And both you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Tiffany have it!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay I totally ran out of ideas of who I wanted to tag. So if you’d like to be tagged, let me know and I can. :P It’s a quick and interesting post. It was actually pretty interesting to write as well since it made me think of interesting things about myself!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>On Driving</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/on-driving/"/> <updated>2007-06-27T10:40:23-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/on-driving</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you should do when you’re driving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weave&lt;/strong&gt; - You mastered Gran Tourismo. Life is just like that. Everyone else is just a computer and they don’t matter. They’re just obstacles in your way to the glorious finish line!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swerve Suddenly and As Late As Possible&lt;/strong&gt; - Don’t make controlled lane changes in a reasonable amount of time. Wait until the very last second and surprise everyone with what you’re going to do. The government and Google already know everything about you, why let them know what lane you’re going to change to? That’s right, stick it to the Man.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yell At Other Drivers&lt;/strong&gt; - Why bother being nice and full of good cheer? Inside you want to yell at them anyways. Old, young, black, white, hispanic, asian, gangsters, teenagers, rich, or poor they had no right to be there when you wanted to change into their lane. So go ahead, give ‘em an earful. And you wouldn’t want to make the tirade any less effective so go ahead and stare at them while you yell. Don’t worry about making sure not to hit someone else while you’re not looking. I already let them know that you’re going to not be paying attention so they’ll rightfully get out of your way. Because it’s all about you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross Double Yellow Lines&lt;/strong&gt; - They don’t mean anything anyways. What are lines anyways? They’re just contrived barriers between us and the world. As a kid you wanted to color outside of the lines. And now as a driver you want to cross them as many times as you can. So let loose and cross them. Or better yet, just straddle the lines and pretend that the lines are like the rail that guides your Autopia car at Disneyland. That should be fun trying to sqeeze through when there are stupid cars on either side of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheat In The Carpool Lane&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/&quot;&gt;Cheaters 4 Life&lt;/a&gt;? Who cares, you need to get somewhere fast and the carpool lane was made for that. It’s not fair that people that decrease gas usage get to go faster. You paid good money for your vehicle and you deserve to go as fast as you are able to. Besides, you’re more important than everyone else anyways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tailgate&lt;/strong&gt; - Stick as close as possible to the car in front of you. “I don’t want to get into an accident,” you say. Sissy! I always say if you can’t kiss it, then you shouldn’t be staring at its rear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;So follow these simple steps and you’ll quickly be going the wrong way. However, if you’d rather be going the &lt;strong&gt;Wong&lt;/strong&gt; way, use your head and don’t do any of them!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://qmusings.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Ms. Q&lt;/a&gt; for the idea. If it goes well (people enjoy it), I’m sure that I will come up with more. So let me know what you think of it.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>That's Not Why I Pay Taxes</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/thats-not-why-i-pay-taxes/"/> <updated>2007-06-25T12:15:02-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/thats-not-why-i-pay-taxes</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear Police Officer,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would just like to say that I am thankful that you are around. You provide some semblance of safety and law in this crazy world. All sorts of characters cross paths with you on a daily basis, and you face the type of unknown danger that I will likely never experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet on that note, I would like to say that you have no right to take taxpayer money and leave your stupid car on just so you would not have to experience 15 seconds of discomfort when you get back into your car. As gas is so expensive nowadays (and even worse such that I want them to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/21/give-it-back/&quot;&gt;Give It Back&lt;/a&gt; after money that they have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/17/sneakily-selfish/&quot;&gt;Sneakily Selfish&lt;/a&gt; in obtaining), I know that there is definite waste going on over there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could not even believe that you would leave your car in such a state. As I walked from the bank to Jamba Juice, I happened to walk near your car. I heard a sound that seemed as if something was going on. I doubled back just to check if my suspicions were true. Yep, there your car was with its engine running and nobody in the car. And you were nowhere to be found. I had seen you earlier sauntering into Corner Bakery for who knows what. Let’s hope that there was some sandwich-snatcher there that you had to apprehend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some thoughts crossed my mind such as I wonder how crazy it would be to open the door (for you must have left it open if your key was in the ignition) and take off with your car or how lazy and in need of comfort must you be to do such a thing! Sure I understand that at 80 degrees in California, you’ve got it bad. Real bad. Life is hard and A/C is the only thing that can save you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But you did all of this on my dime. Yes, mine. I do not give money to the government so that you can do this. Okay well I mainly give money because I have to. But if I did have a choice, I would not give it so that you could do that! Please think about what you’re doing next time. Or I’m going to have a talking with you. Alright, I’ll probably just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/tag/rant&quot;&gt;rant&lt;/a&gt; about it again on my blog. But it will be an angrier one!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So stop it. No one likes a &lt;del&gt;leach&lt;/del&gt; leech. They just want to squash them. Or if you’re Bear Grylls of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/29/man-vs-wild-rawr/&quot;&gt;Man vs Wild (rawr!)&lt;/a&gt; fame, you’d eat ‘em.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sincerely, Derek&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Why Hype Up The iPhone?</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/why-hype-up-the-iphone/"/> <updated>2007-06-23T13:00:30-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/why-hype-up-the-iphone</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or is it tiring listening to things getting hyped up? More specifically, I’m rather tired of reading and seeing the iPhone everywhere. If you don’t know, the iPhone is the new upcoming cellular phone that combines the media and ease of use of an iPod with the web browsing and touchscreen of a smart phone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sounds good doesn’t it? Well I’m sure that it will be nice, but it’s not going to be the end all to everything. I don’t even get why there is such a tremendous amount of hype! Everyone is completely enamored with Apple products all of a sudden even if they’re simply a good-looking product that does not even have anything new to offer (look up Apple TV). Sure they have some real nice products, but not everything that they touch is going to turn to gold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smart phones have existed. Touchscreens have existed. Phones that can play music and video have existed. Devices that can access the Internet have existed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the only new thing is something that does these things from Apple. How novel. How worth $500. Coming this upcoming week to an Apple fanatic near you.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Let 'Em All Make Money</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/let-em-all-make-money/"/> <updated>2007-06-22T21:30:57-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/let-em-all-make-money</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Trying out a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reviewme.com&quot;&gt;ReviewMe&lt;/a&gt; to see how I feel about it. I like ReviewMe’s set up because even though they offer to pay you for reviews, they are in no way forcing your hand in what you say. So good or bad, that’s how they roll.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing that’s pretty big (okay huge in some places) nowadays is making money off of the Internet. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qooforum.com&quot;&gt;Qoo Forum&lt;/a&gt; is an approach to the issue that (as far as I know) is pretty unique. They are trying to start a forum where people can talk about anything they want to. Where does the money making come in? They propose that if you attain a certain point (currently 50 posts) then they will allow you to have a chance to have ads from your Google AdSense Publisher account be placed on the forum itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I described in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/17/inconsiderate-internet-browsing/&quot;&gt;Inconsiderate Internet Browsing&lt;/a&gt;, advertisements work just as they do for other media. Advertisers get to show whatever they want and in turn they pay for that right. Specifically for the Internet, this means that you can get paid for views or you can get paid for the number of clicks on your advertisements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The look of the site is nice and clean that is easy on the eyes, even if it does seem a little cartoonish because everything on the site has their edges rounded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1352/593051503_7dccbd57fa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;qoo_front&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you can somewhat see, they are trying to reach out to as many categories as they possibly can. There are forums within the Qoo forum ranging from music to gadgets to making money to sports! I think that this might be a problem for them in the future. Granted it allows for growth in any which way. However, just like other things with no purpose, it might fall flat on its face just because it does not have a single intention. I know that I have gone to forums simply because they were forums that were much more centered around a main topic. That might have been software or cars, but I went to that forum because there were people there that knew more than I did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure that’s the kind of people that will be attracted to this site. It seems as if the people that will post here are simply people that are in it to get money for themselves. It’s hard to attract the stable reliable posters that are able to answer people’s questions with that kind of mindset. The reason is that those people who frequent forums to help others do so out of the goodness in their hearts. They like helping others. They are not people who are out to make a quick buck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it does seem like they might have something if my thoughts on people is off. The advertisements in each thread are pretty well placed. They blend well with their styling, but they are slightly off-putting because there are just so many of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1127/593051101_ae2929d988.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;qoo_thread&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if you can get an advertisement there, you do seem to have a reasonable chance of making some money. I’m sure that Qoo will also be having much of their own advertisements placed in the site as well (of course they’re revenue &lt;strong&gt;sharing&lt;/strong&gt;, not revenue &lt;strong&gt;giving&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is all of the “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” mentality. And that’s not too bad of an idea because it seems like it was easy to set up with existing tools. They’re utilizing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vbulletin.com/&quot;&gt;vBulletin&lt;/a&gt; for their forum software, they had to think of an interesting domain, they need the hardware to host it all, and then they can utilize Google’s existing ad network!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some things that I saw while looking around where that I wasn’t actually sure how likely you are to get your advertisements on the threads that you start once you hit that magic 50 post level. In the FAQ it says in one place “Currently, you are entitled to 50% chance of showing your ad code within the threads that are started by you” whereas in a similar section it says “Once you have reached that level, your ad code will be applied to all the threads started by you.” That’s confusing to say the least. Additionally I noticed some grammatical errors along the lines of some of the items that I mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/28/learn-some-english-part-1/&quot;&gt;Learn Some English (Part 1)&lt;/a&gt;. They should get someone to give it a good read through and through to give it a more professional feel to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, I think that the Qoo Forum has an intriguing idea that might turn out to pan out for lots of people. However, seeing as how they are brand spanking new, I’m not sure how well they will actually do. They are working off of people’s greed, and seeing as how that is very apparent in many people, they just might do alright.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Stalker Style</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/stalker-style/"/> <updated>2007-06-22T10:30:39-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/stalker-style</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/49968232@N00/521201913&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.flickr.com/224/521201913_e2d91cdff5_s.jpg&quot;

Of course I dreaded it. At least it’s on the way down right now. But when I got out of my automobile to start pumping the liquid into my vehicle and my money into the machine, I saw something that took me aback. There, above the very machine that was essentially taking my money was a television! It was complete with sound and a fairly sharp display!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Technology is amazing. They are able to put a television in a gas station!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then I thought for another second and realized that they must have used some of my money in order to install all of these televisions! Sure it’s nice to watch the television for about 2 minutes, but I’d much rather have the money that they used back! Just goes to show you that those gas station owners sure aren’t on hard times.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Immediate Introductions</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/immediate-introductions/"/> <updated>2007-06-19T14:29:28-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/immediate-introductions</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Meeting new people is a fact of life. However, have you ever met someone after you initially saw them and recognized them? Now I might be the only one, but I doubt it. I’m not strange enough to be completely alone here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, I’ve realized something that I think that we would all do well to know. Not meeting someone initially creates an awkward environment. After you’ve already seen them and come to recognize them without having actually met them is a situation in which both of you know that the other exists, but neither of you feel comfortable talking to the other. Not having an introduction can come about in a variety of ways:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone didn’t do their duty when they know both of you and introduced you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are both slightly uncomfortable with meeting strangers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somehow you already know about the other person, but you know that they have no idea who you are. That makes you afraid to approach them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay I’m sure that there are more ways that this can happen. However it came about, if it happens to you you should know that the longer you wait to talk and/or meet the other person, the more strange it will be when you actually do. So just go for it and introduce yourself. Remember that they might feel just as strange about without knowing your name while seeing you in the halls. Or in a group of people. Or around the neighborhood. Or living right next door to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only thing that you have to do after that is not forget that you met them. Because the other person likely did not forget. And then they’ll know that you didn’t care to remember your name. Or even that they met you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meet ‘em early, not often.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Blasé</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/blase/"/> <updated>2007-06-18T11:30:21-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/blase</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[blah-&lt;strong&gt;zey&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;blah&lt;/strong&gt;-zey] adjective&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be indifferent, unimpressed, or uncaring because frequent exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first the glamor and glitz of living like a movie star was enthralling and exciting, but soon she became blasé even when she would get to fly on private planes to Paris just for lunch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;A much better word than the more often heard “blah” wouldn’t you say?&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>More Favorite Posts</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/more-favorite-posts/"/> <updated>2007-06-16T15:30:04-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/more-favorite-posts</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And now presenting…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;favorite posts in the sidebar!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Courtesy of the plugin that I used for my sitemap (as described in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/12/a-sitemap-for-you-and-them/&quot;&gt;A Sitemap For You And Them&lt;/a&gt;), there are now the top (for now 10) posts listed in the sidebar. “Popularity” is a rather arbitrary thing to decide, so my popular posts are based on a calculation using the number of views and responses.

The real finals happened in the West, probably the Suns vs Spurs series. LeBron James gets a lot of attention, but Tony Parker was the one who tore it up. I said as much before the series started that Parker was going to be their downfall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was one of the least interesting finals series in a long time. Instead of watching game 4 last night, I just decided to wash my truck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Cavs were so over matched they couldn’t even pull out 1 game (granted, they were close a couple of times). Even the Lakers took one from the Suns!

But maybe I’ll start. Here is one for the season that is summer. And one caveat to this post is that must know that I live in sunny southern California, so if you live in some forsaken place then you’ll just have to wish it were different for you. Or you can bask in the cons that I experience and enjoy your freezing cold. Just know this: I wouldn’t trade places with you at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro:&lt;/strong&gt;The sun gives us vitamin D which is needed for, among other things, calcium to be absorbed and used. It also gives you a nice healthy looking glow. &lt;strong&gt;Con:&lt;/strong&gt;The sun causes skin cancer. It also causes wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro:&lt;/strong&gt;Can make use of those expensive sunglasses. &lt;strong&gt;Con:&lt;/strong&gt;The reflection off of objects is sometimes glaring, especially if we forget to bring those expensive sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro:&lt;/strong&gt;Have more sunlight to play with (or in). &lt;strong&gt;Con:&lt;/strong&gt;Having nobody to play with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro:&lt;/strong&gt;Summer love. &lt;strong&gt;Con:&lt;/strong&gt;Not having anyone to love.

Or having no job and plenty of “vacation time,” but obviously having no money to vacation with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro:&lt;/strong&gt;Cruising in your car, looking cool. &lt;strong&gt;Con:&lt;/strong&gt;Not having had any rain for a long time, so your car is dirty.

And they don’t really relate to the fact that I program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are free. How could you want to pay for software when you can have it &lt;strong&gt;legally&lt;/strong&gt; for free?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more agile (updated more quickly) in general.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It supports freedom and the opportunity for anyone to get into the software market simply by having a good product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are built by a community that by definition is giving and supportive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I wanted to, I could try to understand the code on my own. Now, I don’t because I don’t exactly have all of the time in the world to understand the source code of applications that are extremely complicated (why would I be using them if they weren’t complicated). Nevertheless it’s rather comforting to know that I could. :P&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, enough of why I like them. Here are some of my favorites!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; - the now ubiquitous web browser has come out of the open sourcing of the Netscape Navigator. It is a “modern” web browser with pretty much full support for web standards. Plus I love the extensions that you can add on at will. Someday I’ll write a post of my favorite extensions. But in any case, it’s standards-compliant, customizable, and supported by a huge community of developers and testers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openoffice.org/&quot;&gt;Open Office&lt;/a&gt; - an awesome replacement suite for your office needs. It has all of the programs that you would need if you’re a Microsoft Office user. It supports more formats than MS Office does, and it is instantly easy to use for anyone who has used any office productivity program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amarok.kde.org/&quot;&gt;AmaroK&lt;/a&gt; - this is an awesome music player. The only drawback is that it’s only available on Linux. It is an iTunes-like player with integration with a myriad of services including automatic lyric retrieval, last.fm synchronization, and wikipedia integration for information about the artist that you’re currently listening to! They’re starting work on porting this application to other systems, but this would be a huge incentive for any music lover to go to linux.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.videolan.org/&quot;&gt;VLC media player&lt;/a&gt; - plays pretty much any format of media that you can throw at it (with the exception of the closed Real media). It’s lightweight and it is on any platform that you could have!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pidgin.im/pidgin/home/&quot;&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt; - recently renamed from GAIM because of a settlement, this is an instant messaging program that supports lots of different protocols out there. And that means that you can replace all of your chatting programs with this single program. Its looks are similar to other projects, but it surpasses them in features.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gimp.org/&quot;&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt; - the Gnu Image Manipulation Project is a full-featured replacement for your image editing needs. It can even help you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/24/passport-pictures/&quot;&gt;make your own passport pictures&lt;/a&gt;. Photoshop is ridiculously expensive. People always cheat and install illegal copies. This is a great replacement for pretty much everyone out there. You can even make it look like Photoshop with &lt;a href=&quot;http://plasticbugs.com/?page_id=294&quot;&gt;Gimpshop&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; - this platform is obviously getting more and more recognition. I could have stated that I like Linux, but I do in fact just use Ubuntu. There is a huge community, and it’s growing quickly. It is a really easy operating system to use (familiar enough for anyone who has previously used an operating system) with some very good hardware support. It plays nice with older hardware (the server that this blog is currently hosted on was originally running Windows 98, but now runs quite nicely on Ubuntu).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; - on that note, the Apache software foundation is making some really awesome server software. It powers quite a lot of the Internet. It’s easy to set up and there is lots and lots of documentation out there for its use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess that was basically split up with the top half being the more “usable” programs that everyone would want to use while the end was geared more towards specialized uses. Nevertheless, I think that everyone out there could stand to try out the products coming out of these software projects. Even if you decide to use your commercial program (which is not a problem if it’s better and more for what you need) then that’s fine. But for lots of people, especially those with illegal software, you might want to try out these programs. And then you should read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/14/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid/&quot;&gt;Music Piracy Makes People Stupid&lt;/a&gt; for a longer post about why I think that cheating, stealing, etc is so despicable. And then you should own up, repent, and go sit in the corner. We can all sit there together while we think about what we’ve done.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>A Sitemap For You (And Them)</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-sitemap-for-you-and-them/"/> <updated>2007-06-12T11:34:53-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-sitemap-for-you-and-them</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/sitemap.xml&quot;&gt;sitemap&lt;/a&gt; (which is, if the name doesn’t already indicate, a map of this entire website). It includes links to every page available on my site! The purpose of this is to allow search engine ‘bots (computers that “crawl” through the Internet so that pages can be found through their search engine) to be aware of all of my pages. I’m using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arnebrachhold.de/redir/sitemap-home/&quot;&gt;Google Sitemaps plugin&lt;/a&gt; which will automatically update the sitemap every time I update or create a post. I’m also using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dicontas.co.uk/blog/google-sitemap-utw-tag-wordpress-plugin/&quot;&gt;Google Sitemap - append Tags plugin&lt;/a&gt; in order to add the tag pages (where you can see all of the posts with that a tag) to the sitemap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that it’s cool, although I’m looking for a better way to order it. It seems like it should be ordered based on the number of comments because that’s what I set the option for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hmm I just installed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexking.org/blog/2005/07/27/popularity-contest-11/&quot;&gt;Popularity Contest plugin&lt;/a&gt; to see if I could use that in order to calculate how to order the sitemap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now I just easily set it to calculate the priority based on the Popularity Contest plugin! It uses a priority that is calculated using view count, comments, pingbacks (links to), etc. I also just realized that the sitemap is just ordered by having the most recently changed posts at the top. I suppose that this makes some sense since it is for updating the index of the ‘bot that is crawling it. There is no sense in updating the index of a page that is unchanged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay so basically, now you can browse through and check out posts based on their priority. I just recently made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/favorite-posts/&quot;&gt;Favorite Posts&lt;/a&gt; page, but I’m not sure if I should still keep it.

I enjoyed reading his, and I realize now that people might enjoy one that I did as well. I must admit that when I stopped to think, I realized that I actually had not put any pictures of myself on this blog. I am some anonymous (presumably) Asian male who writes for this blog. Well well well that’s interesting. So here we go!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thought that I’d post pictures marking periods of change in my life. Oh and sorry that the quality is not very good. It was partly because I don’t have a quality scanner to get those prints that are only in hard form, and it is also partly on purpose because I don’t want high quality pictures of me floating around on the Internet. You never know what incriminating things people can do to you. ;-)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1143/537843608_d7d9d09650_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;glasses&quot; /&gt; Ah young Derek, eagerly awaiting his birthday cake. I believe it was an ice cream pie. Those are good, indeed. Notice the obscenely large glasses. I believe the proper term for me back then was baller. :P&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1210/537843606_854ee8523d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;before_braces&quot; /&gt; This was taken right before I got braces to fix those horrendous canine teeth. &lt;del&gt;bicuspids. (That would be the canine teeth if you didn’t know.)&lt;/del&gt; I had fun during that time but boy did those canine teeth &lt;del&gt;bicuspids&lt;/del&gt; cut my lips!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1061/537843610_f549cce98e_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;high_school&quot; /&gt; A pictures of myself from high school. Thus marked the end of my strange (for the most part) days. This was taken sometime in the middle of high school. I didn’t like that time period in my life.

As you can see, I’m a much more interesting fellow. I’d like to think that I’ve come into my own and am comfortable in my own skin. :D Also notice the advent of the digital camera. Splendid!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So in continuing with this fun game, I’d like to tag Shelly at This Eclectic Life, Mat at matkishimoto’s blogspot, Ms. Q at qmusings, and HMTKSteve (strangely enough I don’t know if his name is actually Steve :P) at Ramblings of the Marginalized.

After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://qmusings.com/blog/2007/05/27/are-you-afraid-of-hugs/&quot;&gt;Are You Afraid Of Hugs&lt;/a&gt;, I went on over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freehugscampaign.org/&quot;&gt;Free Hugs Campaign&lt;/a&gt; website and discovered a very interesting story!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A man, feeling alone and disconnected from the world, went out to a local place and offered free hugs with a sign. Now that seems pretty strange if you think about what you’d feel if you saw someone doing the same. I know that I would have thought that he was just a creepy guy trying to feel someone up. But in any case, it turns out that this guy really just wanted to spread the love. And I think that’s an excellent idea!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world we live in truly is disconnected from each other. We see hundreds of people everyday, and we don’t even bother to greet most of them. Even with the people that we do know and talk to, between cellular phones, e-mail, and instant messaging, our communication is distant at best. We don’t look people in the eye as often. And that is just too bad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hugs are the antithesis of today’s mindset. That is why the Free Hugs Campaign was so revolutionary. It totally went against the norm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, I like hugs a lot. Why?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Receiving a hug gives you a certain feeling of being accepted for who you really are&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Giving a hug lets others know that you care about them in a tangible way&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hugs are something that you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do with just about anyone&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hugs are free&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Give ‘em a chance.

Wizard of Bras! I thought that was pretty amusing, indeed. It’s even funnier because it’s a random thing to have a commercial for on the radio.

But there was a bumper sticker of an Israeli flag, and there was a license plate frame that was from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hillcrestcs.org/&quot;&gt;Hillcrest Christian School&lt;/a&gt;. How does that work?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You know, I could very well be wrong because it might not be that ironic after all.

Does anyone? Well I do. Sometimes anyways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve been noticing things about the advertisements in magazines. Well I guess depending on the magazine that you are reading, things are different. However, with some of the magazines that I’ve recently read, the thing that I don’t understand is why advertisers would even want their advertisements placed in the back. Do people even look at them (I know that I don’t)? Is their respective business increased as a result of being placed amongst many other advertisements? I just don’t get it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are they scared that if they stop advertising, that their business will decrease? It seems to me that it’s hard to justify the cost of placing such a poorly placed advertisement. Well, the poorly placed is just my opinion. Stuck in the nether pages with other random advertisements is not exactly a place that readers like to peruse carefully if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that some of the best advertisements are those that give you something simply by looking. Well I am still talking about magazine advertisements so this does not apply to other advertisements. In any case, have you read those advertisements that give you some useful information and/or organize what they’re selling so that it’s very appealing. On the one hand, I like these because they’re useful to me. On the other hand I have to take it all with a grain of salt because it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still an advertisement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, I don’t think that I’m ever going to be someone who will advertise in a magazine. But then again, I guess that’s why I don’t make my living in the areas of fashion, car parts, or male enhancement gimmicks.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Penchant</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/penchant/"/> <updated>2007-06-04T11:30:45-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/penchant</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;pen&lt;/strong&gt;-ch_uh_nt]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;A strong preference, attraction to, or desire for something&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;As someone who loves the outdoors, Rob has a penchant for taking picnics with his love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is has nothing to do with pens or chants.

It had a list of AIM acronyms that are not all too commonly used taken from America Online, 2007. Now most people nowadays know of things like LOL (laugh out loud), BRB (be right back), and TTYL (talk to you later). But those are maybe just the originals and can’t necessarily say exactly what you want. Or maybe they’re so overused that they’re boring. In any case, if you already knew any of the following, you have been online far too much.

Aluminum cans, glass bottles, plastic bottles, and more can all be recycled. I know that this is not true everywhere, but here in California you actually have to put a cash deposit down on every single item when you pay for it. So when you recycle the item (whether it be plastic or aluminum or whatever) you are actually only getting back your deposit. Somehow I think that if everyone knew this, then there would be more recycling going on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, I’d like to share a tip for recycling on your own. As you very well know, you don’t have to actually return cans in order to be recycling. You could also be recycling by using things for multiple purposes. A sample case would be the following tip:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next time you go grocery shopping (after using &lt;a href=&quot;http://prices.goingthewongway.com/&quot;&gt;the grocery pricer&lt;/a&gt; to check that you’re going to buy things at a good price, of course) you should choose to ask for plastic one time and paper the next. At home, take the paper bag and place it inside of the plastic one. Unfold the paper bag so that it is now simply its original size with the plastic bag on the outside of it. Place your trash in this bag and when full throw the entire thing away. This is useful because the paper will be able to hold the majority of the weight while the plastic ensures that no leaking will happen. By using this method, you are going to save yourself some cost for “trash bags” while also recycling the bags that you’ve gotten from the grocery store!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t actually know if this is a well-known thing to do. Maybe it is, and I’m just unaware. In any case I’d like those that don’t know to be able to do this as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh I just thought of another tip that I heard from someone. After you’re done with your toothbrush (if you still use the traditional manual one) then you can use that in your cleaning around the house! If toothbrushes are designed to get rid of the nasty plaque on your teeth, then don’t you think that they’ll be good at cleaning any kind of gunk that you can throw at it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alright and coincidentally I just read about some tips for different uses for everyday household things. I like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realsimple.com/realsimple/gallery/0,21863,1030084-5,00.html&quot;&gt;different uses for dryer sheets&lt;/a&gt;, but you can check out the tips for all 10 items featured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, recycling is not hard, it’s good for both the environment and society, and it’s good for you! So take the opportunity and happy recycling!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>(Big) Mac Enthusiasts</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/big-mac-enthusiasts/"/> <updated>2007-06-01T09:45:53-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/big-mac-enthusiasts</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Gorske&quot;&gt;Big Mac enthusiast&lt;/a&gt; and then there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://theappleblog.com/2007/01/30/interview-with-jeremy-mehrle-uber-mac-collector/&quot;&gt;big Mac enthusiast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.supersizeme.com&quot;&gt;Super Size Me&lt;/a&gt; is so interesting because you see how crazy the whole culture behind McDonald’s is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fans of Apple are interesting because they are such &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/28/fanaticism/&quot;&gt;fanatics&lt;/a&gt;.

You probably have to think about that for a little to even understand it. Well I did anyways.

I saw an article about Lindsey Lohan’s outrageous behavior. Now granted, I do not know what Miss Lohan was like before she became famous, but I do know that it seems like more often than not, people are corrupted by success. If you don’t know about this particular case, she was basically caught driving drunk as well as with a substance, possibly cocaine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case whether it be a star athlete getting a big head or a rock star falling into drugs or anything else, it’s fairly safe to say that power and success can definitely corrupt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am not a big believer on following the lives of other people (especially “stars”). Still, one can’t help but see that very often their world will get turned upside down and become less and less likable as their “star power” increases. It’s a shame that it’s so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess Spanglish has content that’s deeper than you’d think.

It’s amazing while also being hilarious. First off, the man’s name is Bear. That’s not a nickname. That’s just his name. You &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; that he’s gotta be awesome if his name is “Bear.” In any case, a cameraman (okay maybe a crew?) follows him as he does whatever it takes to survive in various harsh climates. I’ve seen him in places like the Rockies, a volcano crater in Hawaii, the African desert, and other such fun places.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;favorite-moments-from-man-vs-wild&quot;&gt;7 Favorite Moments From Man vs Wild&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he &lt;strong&gt;eats a live snake&lt;/strong&gt; by biting off the head (which according to Bear would taste disgusting) and slurping the rest of it through his mouth like a spaghetti noodle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating maggots&lt;/strong&gt; from an animal that was killed in an avalanche. Apparently the actual animal flesh would be dangerous to eat because it’s rotten. But the maggots that eat the rotten flesh? They’re just fine. Who would’ve thought?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he tries to &lt;strong&gt;ride a wild horse&lt;/strong&gt; but fails miserably because he tries to mount it after only being around it for a little bit. I think that because he’s so good, it’s pretty funny when he fails. :P&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catching and &lt;strong&gt;taking a big bite out of a live fish&lt;/strong&gt;. He looked like Gollum. It was disgustingly awesome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finding a zebra that was killed by lions and then picked by vultures. The bones are clean. So what does Bear do? He cuts off the skin near the neck and &lt;strong&gt;eats the zebra meat raw&lt;/strong&gt;. And then he puts some in his pocket to eat later!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about how rattlesnakes are dangerous and how you shouldn’t get close to them. All the while &lt;strong&gt;walking closer and closer to the rattlesnake&lt;/strong&gt; right in front of him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finding a mound of ants, talking about how he only eats the abdomen of the ants because the bite hurts, and then &lt;strong&gt;allowing an ant to bite his tongue&lt;/strong&gt; so that you can see how much it must hurt. And the ants are actually a “sweet treat” to him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Isn’t it amazing what people will do to survive? I don’t think that this kind of brutal living is ever hardly seen by many of us because we are in “civilized” locations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that a great part of the appeal to the show is that he (seemingly) actually enjoys all of it. Oh and for some reason the British accent makes it that much more interesting and authentic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could learn a lot from this show. Perhaps even more than just the survival techniques. But even if I couldn’t, at least I’d have a great time being grossed out, amazed, and entertained.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Learn Some English (Part 1)</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/learn-some-english-part-1/"/> <updated>2007-05-28T11:30:47-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/learn-some-english-part-1</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t like when people use English words or phrases without knowing how to use them. I started compiling a list after reading some blogs and noticing errors in their English. And these were not blogs started in foreign countries. These were supposedly English language based blogs! In any case, peruse the list and see if you’re guilty of any of these mistakes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;maybe/may be&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;“Maybe” means perhaps while “may be” means could be. Okay okay I know that using “be” in the definition is not good. Nevertheless, there is a definite difference between the phrases. Examples: “Maybe I’ll go tonight” vs “She may be going tonight”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they’re/their/there&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;This difference between words is pretty well-known, and yet it is still often misused. The first is a contraction of “they are” so you have to be able to substitute “they are everywhere you use “they’re.” “Their” is possessive. “There” indicates location. Examples: “They’re going to eat food” vs “I’m going to eat their food” vs “We are going to eat food there”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;its/it’s&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;This happens so often it’s sickening. Haha I just used “it’s.” Anyways “its” is a possessive of a previously mentioned inanimate object while “it’s” is a contraction of “it is.” Examples: “Don’t judge a book by its cover” vs “Look around the city in the fall and see how it’s all changing”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;site/sight&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The difference between these words is that “site” means location and “sight” means something that is seen. Examples: “Why don’t we go to the construction site to see how things are going” vs “Boy those fireworks over the water sure are a sight to see.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;buy/by/bye&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;“Buy” means “to purchase”, “by” is a preposition that has a number of meanings including “of or near to” or “through a particular medium”, “bye” is either a shortening of the common greeting “goodbye” or the opportunity for a team to not have to play another team in a sports tournament.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case that list is not, by an means, exhaustive. I think that I actually don’t mind it when people know that they are not experts at English. However, I think that I have the most problem with people when they make it seem as if they have a complete idea of what they’re saying. Such is life, huh? So try to learn what you can.

Well I’m sure that many people do anyways. They must, otherwise why would I get called it so often? :P In any case this word is definitely an amusing version of stupid. However, use it wisely because it is definitely harsher than “stupid” can be. While “stupid” can be used in a joking manner, the word “asinine” isn’t often used as such.

The scammers will call and ask for you social security number to verify who you are as well as your credit card number in order to process your fine. Now a word to the wise: be very careful whenever you are asked for either of these pieces of information &lt;strong&gt;no matter what the situation is&lt;/strong&gt;. That is a reasonable thing to remember whenever you are confronted with things like this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So obviously after that you get taken for much more than your supposed fine. You get taken for your identity. And that is just no good.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Jury Duty Is Good?</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/jury-duty-is-good/"/> <updated>2007-05-25T10:00:07-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/jury-duty-is-good</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whenever somebody gets a summons for jury duty, they are very likely going to cry out in disappointment as soon as they see it. Why? Well it is inconvenient and a burden on us to do something that we don’t really like to do. Pretty much the main reason that we do it is so that we don’t get something like a fine or a contempt of court notice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, yesterday I served my jury duty. This is not the first time that I have had it, and I am pretty sure that it won’t be the last time. But I think that this time made me think more deeply about this thing that we call our civic duty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those that don’t know (and I’m not exactly sure how you wouldn’t know), jury duty in America is when you are given a summons to appear at a courthouse at a specified time and asked to possibly serve as a juror in a trial. So basically you go to a room and wait for them to call you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the thing is that there are lots (actually a majority) of people that have a strong distaste for jury duty. I must admit that I don’t care for it all too much either. It takes you away from things that you’d rather be doing, and it is possibly inconvenient when it comes to compensation and traveling. But if you think about it, we are all being short-sighted and foolish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason that jury duty is not as bad as it seems is that it ensures us a very important right that we have by living in America. It ensures us a trial by our peers if we are ever in such a situation as would deserve a trial. And that is a great thing. I, for one, am very opposed to the idea of getting judged by a bunch of lawyer-like nit-picking professional jurors. Instead I could be judged by people who, although not exactly like me, seem like they would represent a slice of society that would in some way give me a fair and objective judgment. It is a very important part of the foundation of being the United States of America! People (very many people in fact) have died for the cause of letting us have the rights that we have. And yet we, in our selfish self-centered ways, cannot find it within ourselves to give up a day (or possibly a couple of weeks) to uphold this. Amazing, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess when you put it that way, the whole idea of serving jury duty doesn’t seem so horrible after all. Of course, I also didn’t actually get called to a jury or else I might be singing a different tune. Ah well maybe life’s more profound observations come from the sidelines. Nevertheless, think about jury duty (as well as all of the other things that happen in your life), and the ramifications that it has for your world before you immediately complain about them. So the more logical, reasonable, and sane part of me says that maybe jury duty isn’t so bad after all. But that might just last for the next 12 months until my emotional side once again takes control when I see that notice in the mail.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Lovely Civic Duty</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/lovely-civic-duty/"/> <updated>2007-05-24T08:30:06-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/lovely-civic-duty</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I was on call for the hardly enviable jury duty this week.

I like giving them to all types of people. I’ve found that it helps to break many initial layers of ice that might exist when you’re first getting to know people. The real key, in my opinion, to nicknames is that they create a bond between the person with the nickname and others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess that there are also different types of nicknames. I don’t mean derogatory, kind, or funny. I mean there are nicknames that everyone calls someone by and then there are nicknames that only exist between the nickname giver and the nickname recipient. I like the latter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of discussing all of the nicknames that I’ve given, though, I’d like to now list all of the ones that I’ve received. The interesting list includes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JQ&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;It stands for Johnny Quest. I don’t even know why I got it.&lt;/em&gt;__&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T-man&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;This is actually a funny story. So in college I met a couple of girls at an event. And then I met them again. And again. And finally one time when they asked me what my name was, I got tired of it so I just told them it was Mr. T. As in the A-team guy with the gold chains. Haha and they thought to call me T-man. After that, they sure remembered who I was!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deek&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;I don’t even know why the girl who gave me this one did. I think it’s pretty strange. Just like the nickname giver. :P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darkwing&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Okay this is a strange one because it’s half given by myself. In the cartoon Darkwing Duck, the theme song has a line “when you’re in trouble you call DW.” So I think that someone called me Darkwing Duck when I was a little kid because of the song. And then I made up an AIM screen name using it. And then someone started using it (but only on rare occasions).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirk&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;I suppose that this one makes sense because of how similar it sounds to my name. If only I played like Mr. Nowitzki. Well not so much in the playoffs this year. But all of the rest of the time that’d be awesome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reDERKulous&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;I think that this is an awesome nickname. I got this nickname when someone was making them up to input as our bowler names. I appreciate the creativity, and I’ve used this as a screen name in video games (namely Halo 1 and 2). Of course, since I made the name I had to live up to it and truly be reDERKulous. :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DT&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;This is an obvious one since my middle initial is T. The one who gave me this one doesn’t use it too often, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drek&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Another obvious one, but it shows how the giver is very unique and unlike others. Plus it just sounds amusing in her voice, like a little kid who can’t entirely say a word.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Derek Wong-a-long&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;I got this in high school. Haha I have no idea why. It doesn’t mean anything (meaningful or perverted).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ricardo&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;HA this one is so random. I actually don’t even remember HOW the person who gave this one to me got it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;junny&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;I only got this one because I made one up for this person that had to do with their Korean name. It’s an amusing one, though because it is seemingly a name for a 13 year old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;derekson&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;I think that the person who gave me this name just likes to append different endings to people real names to come up with a nickname.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;muga&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;This one was definitely in response to me giving someone the nickname “muha”. Nonetheless it’s an amusing one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d-d-d-d-derek&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;I don’t even know how she came up with this. But she did.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay that is all just a sample of the different nicknames that I’ve received. There are definitely others (some of which I have likely forgotten forever). There are others that I’m not eager to share and have thus kept them to myself. And then there is one of my very favorite: &lt;strong&gt;derekudarkwingduckingofthejungle&lt;/strong&gt;. Well it wins for longest, that is for sure. And it is one of the most original. My very amusing friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanga.com/totml715&quot;&gt;Melissa Tong&lt;/a&gt; is the very originator of this nickname. Haha how awesome is that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, she would also appreciate a post about her. ;-) I hardly ever write about actual people that I know, instead prefering to focus on ideas and topics. However I will make an exception in this case (and possibly others in the future). Anyways, I realized while talking to her that something cool that she does is give people amusing nicknames! I really enjoy that her nicknames, although perhaps not stemming from an event but rather their actual name, are still original and humorous. Plus they’re usually corny. And that says a lot about the person that she is. Well seeing as how I told her that someday I’d write about her, I considered many other amusing things to talk about instead of just the fact that she gives out lots of nicknames. Some of the other considered topics and quotes are more funny, but I decided to refrain on my better judgment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, nicknames are fun. I like giving them, and I like getting them. However I must admit that they require some real perseverance if you want them to stick. Oh and I don’t really like mean-spirited ones because they detract from the previously mentioned bond between giver and recipient.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Amusing Searches</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/amusing-searches/"/> <updated>2007-05-22T13:15:36-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/amusing-searches</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So another advantage to hosting my own blog (okay it’s not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; limited to hosting yourself) in addition to other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/15/cost-and-benefits-of-running-your-own-server/&quot;&gt;costs and benefits of running your own server&lt;/a&gt; is that you get to see statistics.

Haha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;siafu ant&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;One would think that I would get no hits on the Siafu Ants since there are other much more reputable sources than my blog on a species of ant. Oh well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;**tweedle dee tweedle dumb **- &lt;em&gt;Apparently nobody writes about Alice in Wonderland anymore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how to use gimp to make a passport photo&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;I would guess that someone could arrive at my site on this because it’s a pretty specific topic that I wrote a post about.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Jennifer Shih facebook **- &lt;em&gt;Now that’s just strange.

Of course I probably disappoint because I don’t exactly have amazingly gross photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;**wong way poet **- &lt;em&gt;That seems pretty specific to me. You’d think that they could just remember “goingthewongway” if they can already remember “wong way.” Or maybe there is just some poet out there named wong who is writing about the way. I bet he wants my domain name. :P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;**california dmv temporary-operating-permit **- &lt;em&gt;I’m very happy that I can provide the answer to this.

Nevertheless, when I happened upon a piece of software called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifehacker.com/software/featured-download/allocate-your-money-in-envelopes-with-budget-262014.php&quot;&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt; while I was reading through my feed reader this morning, I had to take a second look. Why? Well because I wrote (and am in current development of) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/the-budgeteer/&quot;&gt;The Budgeteer&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were notable differences, obviously. Comparing the two programs, here is what I noticed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Budget deposits absolute amounts into each sub-account (represented as envelopes) whereas the Budgeteer deposits percentages into each sub-account. I recently thought about this difference actually. It would be nice to have options to do both/either. My original approach of percentages allows for things such as taking 10% off the top for tithe, but it has pitfalls such as having to specify a percentage for each sub-account. Granted of course you can play around with them over time such that they will approach what you actually need/want/use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Budget is much prettier. Both their Windows and Mac executables look better than my Python GUI. Granted, I haven’t been trying to make it beautiful or anything. And it is essentially the same functionality (clicking on different buttons, etc). Nevertheless, that is a plus that Budget has.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously Budget is production software that is being sold whereas the Budgeteer is something that I wrote up in a week and have since played with only a little bit. Budget also costs 30 bucks, and (when the time comes) the Budgeteer will not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Budgeteer has a cooler name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, I would like to think that Budget and the Budgeteer are similar. However, I must concede that they are not even close to similar. Budget is much more polished, and I am now more determined to develop the Budgeteer!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve changed the name of the program to Budgeteer.

I’m sure that many people out there already know about this, but I thought it significant enough to write about it. Key bindings are basically combinations of keys that will perform some action because it is associated with it. For example, Ctrl+S is generally regarded as being used to save something, Ctrl+P is used to print, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, for those of you using Mac OS X and who don’t know much about Emacs I wanted to give a short run down. Emacs is basically an extensible text editor with the ability to have user-defined functions. There are key bindings that have a specified meaning when you’re using Emacs. Some useful ones that you might consider trying out are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ctrl+f - Move 1 character forward Ctrl+b - Move 1 character backward Ctrl+d - Delete character in front of the curser Ctrl+a - Move to beginning of line Ctrl+e - Move to end of line&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many more key bindings available to Emacs that seem like they will usually get overridden by the program. Remember, this hint is for Mac OS X users. The most useful place that I could use these key bindings was in text fields in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try it out and let me know. Don’t blame me, though, if you hit the wrong button or if the key binding is overridden to be something else in the program that you try it with!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Inconsiderate Internet Browsing</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/inconsiderate-internet-browsing/"/> <updated>2007-05-17T13:30:59-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/inconsiderate-internet-browsing</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nowadays as nearly everyone has interaction with the Internet in some way, it is important to stop and think about how people might actually be &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the Internet. Actually, right now I want to look at how some people might be &lt;strong&gt;inconsiderately&lt;/strong&gt; using the Internet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few things that I’ve recently realized are inconsiderate browsing habits. To start off with, you must know that for the Firefox browser, there are programs that can be installed called &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:1&quot;&gt;Firefox extensions&lt;/a&gt;. I’d like to use a couple as examples of some of the browsing habits that are inconsiderate. However, it must be noted that they are not the actual habit, but they are rather a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10&quot;&gt;Adblock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1136&quot;&gt;Filterset.G Updater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are both super extensions that are often the first that I’ll install when I have a new installation of Firefox. Basically they attempt to take the ads out of your Internet browsing experience. And they work very well. Adblock will basically filter out anything that you you specify. It is as easy as right-clicking on an ad and adding it to the list to be blocked. However this takes a long time to build up a reasonable list. Luckily it also allows you to use some pattern matching (similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/16/chopped-returns-in-perl/&quot;&gt;regular expressions&lt;/a&gt;) to allow you to make your list useful in a shorter list. Basically it allows you to match multiple things with a single pattern.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not easy for most people. So in comes the Filterset.G Updater! It uses a master list that someone else has taken the time to create. It will match almost all of the ads that you would have normally encountered. Of course some sites are good enough to get around this. Nevertheless it leads to a pretty ad-free browsing experience that is incomparable to one filled with pop-ups and more ads than content.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The inconsideration involved is this: websites need those ads as a source of revenue. Although I’ve only realized much of this by having my own site, it does make a lot of sense. Many sites that you read are free to use. However, they often need some income in order to stay free. It costs money to host a website (sometimes a good deal of it). When you’re browsing a site with ads, it is similar in idea to watching television with commercials. Television uses the revenue that is garnered by having commercials in order to create the content. Merely by the fact that you’re watching the show (and subsequently in some way affecting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielson_ratings&quot;&gt;Nielson Ratings&lt;/a&gt;), you are allowing the television company to charge more for their commercial time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Advertising on the Internet works similarly. I’m talking specifically about Google AdSense because I have experience with it, but this valid for almost all other advertisement programs. There are a couple of ways that users help support a site monetarily through their advertisement program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Viewing an ad. Simply by viewing an ad with the content, users are helping out the site because many ad programs will allow advertisers to purchase space that ends up paying per view (or impression in AdSense speak). The more views a site gets, the more it gets paid. 2. Clicking on an ad. This is definitely applicable for all advertisement programs out there because nearly all of them will pay a site publisher (those producing the content for a site) based on how many clicks that an ad gets. There are a number of ways that a publisher might put ads on their website, but that is another matter entirely. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you? Well I don’t know what it means for you. But for me it means that I will try to browse in a way that supports the website. As I use the Adblock extension, I can easily do this by&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Clicking the Tools menu 2. Going to the Adblock item 3. Click Whitelist this page or Whitelist this entire site &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whitelisting a site means that you have given that site priority to not have anything blocked by Adblock. To undo this, on the whitelisted paged you can follow the same procedures as above. On top of whitelisting pages/site, you might consider clicking some ads. Don’t think that you’re giving your life away because ads are getting better and better nowadays. Very often they are related to the content that you’re reading (for contextually-based ad programs). So don’t avoid ads like the plague, they do some good by monetarily supporting sites that you are enjoying for free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1269&quot;&gt;Fasterfox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is another extension that highlights some inconsiderate browsing habits. This extension will basically tweak the Firefox settings to give you a faster browsing experience. This seems very cool because it helps you out as the end-user.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this is actually fairly inconsiderate some of the time. The way that this extension works is that you can set how much tweaking you want the extension to do for you. At its extreme, it will prefetch (follow the link and load the page before you actually click on it) pages, open multiple connections to servers, and more. Obviously this puts more a load on the server than is necessary because you will not always click every link in a page nor will you absolutely need to load a page 1 second quicker. By putting an extra load on the server, you are unnecessarily making it harder for the server to serve its content to other people who might want it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, this does not affect low-traffic sites like my own because I could happily handle way more traffic than I currently do. But it does affect higher-traffic sites because they are already closer to being pushed over the edge. And that is just not nice. Other variations of this inconsiderate browsing habit are constantly refreshing pages for no reason, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Utilizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digg.com/&quot;&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is actually somewhat inconsiderate because it often results in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddos#Distributed_attack&quot;&gt;Distributed Denial of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Without going into &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much detail, this is basically when lots and lots of people will simultaneously access a site and overwhelm its ability to serve pages. This means that either some hardware will go down or people who actually would like to visit a site will not be able to because they are stuck behind everyone else waiting for the page. Granted, I participate in using Digg, but it still can definitely be an inconsiderate browsing habit. Consider using caches that have been made of that page. Hopefully most sites that get dugg will be able to handle the traffic and will actually benefit in some way from it (I try to find good ads to help them out with if I like what they have to say).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, you just basically have to think about how your actions affect others and not just yourself. Apparently, that’s true for life as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;edit&gt; After I thought about it a bit, I wanted to add this little bit. By writing this entry I am by no means asking you to support my site though my advertisements. That would be underhanded as well as a likely violation of the Terms of Service for using their programs. But I think that people don&#39;t really know about all of this. So read my entry, but I want what you do with this information to be up to you. But at least now you know. :) &lt;/edit&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>NBA Playoffs (Thus Far Commentary #2)</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/nba-playoffs-thus-far-commentary-2/"/> <updated>2007-05-16T19:30:16-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/nba-playoffs-thus-far-commentary-2</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well of course things go on, so I wanted to write my thoughts at this junction about the NBA Playoffs 2007.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was hoping that the &lt;strong&gt;Golden State Warriors&lt;/strong&gt; would get farther than the second round. However I became ambivalent as Baron Davis’ personality (as well as Stephen Jackson’s) came out. That elbow to Derek Fisher’s face? Unnecessary to the extreme. To say that I gained a lot and lost a lot of respect for the Warriors would be fair to say. I enjoyed their playing because they were passionate and energetic. I started to disapprove of them because many of them turned out to be a bunch of no-class, cocky-without-rights-to, complaining-to-no-end players. And that is not a team that I want to cheer for. So they’re out, and good riddance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of people disliked &lt;strong&gt;Derek Fisher&lt;/strong&gt; when he was on the Lakers. I never felt as strongly about him. In fact, I kind of liked him. He had spirit and he played hard. Plus we share the same first name. He’s by no means the best at his position, but he’s definitely shown in the Jazz vs Warriors series that he’s got lots left in that tank. To see him also having to deal with everything going on with his daughter makes him an especially easy-to-cheer-for player. Bravo on being an impact player in the series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There sure has been a lot of &lt;strong&gt;testiness&lt;/strong&gt; in these playoffs. Is it just me or does it seem like there is more this year than in recent history? Pretty much every series has had some episode of a flareup. LeBron is stepping up, the Pistons are never exactly clean, the aforementioned Warriors and Jazz got it on, and of course the Suns and the Spurs have no love lost for their fellow Texans. It all makes for exciting and emotional games, but I kind of wonder why this year is so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m cheering for the &lt;strong&gt;Chicago Bulls&lt;/strong&gt; to beat the Pistons. I’m not a huge Bulls fan, but I have enjoyed watching them play this year. Unfortunately they seem like they go very cold at times, and that led to the Pistons taking a (seemingly) insurmountable 3-0 series lead on them. They’ve fought back to 3-2, and everyone has been singing their praise. I’d like to see them down the vaunted Pistons myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I barely even hear or see much from the &lt;strong&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers&lt;/strong&gt; side of the bracket. The Wizards series went down very quietly. It’s no surprise, but the West seems to definitely be the better conference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Horry’s forearm to Nash’s face&lt;/strong&gt; was pretty poor. I always kind of liked Horry because I enjoyed his late-game heroics. I’m not really sure what the beef between the Suns and the Spurs is, but I know this: they don’t like each other. I’m not a fan of many of them myself. Many of them (Manu Ginobili, Bruce Bowen, Raja Bell to name a few) are aggressive bordering on extremely dirty. And that’s no good. But I like watching the series because both of these teams are pretty good. They have different styles but they both have multiple superstars who combine to do amazing things sometimes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NBA Playoffs 2007 are definitely interesting. I like seeing people get emotional, but there’s no need to be a jerk about things. Keep it coming. I’m going to enjoy watching more.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Chopped Returns (In Perl)</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/chopped-returns-in-perl/"/> <updated>2007-05-16T10:45:43-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/chopped-returns-in-perl</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Files on computers are made up of different characters that are interpreted by whatever it is that you are using. That means that no matter what file it is, it is essentially a string of bytes that are interpreted by the program opening it. This means that your music program tries to interpret whatever file you open with it to be conformed to some audio standards (mp3, wma, etc.). Try to open the same file in a text editor, and you’ll find yourself looking at (apparently) junk characters. But then you’ll realize that the file is still just a bunch of characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I bring this up because&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems as if people don’t realize this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I encountered this while writing a Perl script today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something else that you should read even if you don’t know what Perl is: Windows and Unix-variants (including Mac OS X and up) do not handle files the same. I’m not talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/28/fanaticism/&quot;&gt;Fanaticism&lt;/a&gt; (because I’ve already posted about that). Windows uses characters that are referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return&quot;&gt;Carriage Return&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_feed&quot;&gt;Line Feed&lt;/a&gt; in order to represent a newline. These names originate because of their original use in the typewriter which actually had a physical mechanism to move. In any case, Unix-variants utilize the line feed character to distinguish its newlines. This can obviously lead to some problems if you use the same files on both systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you don’t know what Perl is then you can fairly safely stop reading this article now because the rest won’t help you much.&lt;/strong&gt; I know that it was hard for me to find and I’d like to make it available if anyone else so happens to run into the same problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While writing a script in Perl today, I had a seemingly strange problem where I would do some processing on my Windows machine and then transfer the file via FTP to a Unix-based server. However I noticed that I had a string that when printed to the screen on my Windows computer would display correctly but would display incorrectly in the file put onto the server. I could not figure this out for quite sometime because it seemed as if some of the lines were printing correctly and some were not. Alright enough explanation. Essentially I thought that the last character was getting chopped off in some way that I did not understand in Perl. However it had to do with Perl assuming that the lines has both a carriage return and a line feed on the lines and then chopping them off when the file was being sent via FTP. The fix that I ended up using was simply a one line regular expression like so (a suggestion from a co-worker):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$output=&lt;/code&gt;some action&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;; $output=~ s/n/rn/g; print $output; print FOUT $output;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hope that this helps someone searching for an answer. I know that I would have liked to have happened upon the answer while searching for it.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Cost And Benefits Of Running Your Own Server</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/cost-and-benefits-of-running-your-own-server/"/> <updated>2007-05-15T20:15:39-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/cost-and-benefits-of-running-your-own-server</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a cost to running your own web server. I’m not talking about the actual monetary cost, although there definitely is some of that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m talking about the down time and lack of production-level reliability. I just got my Internet connection back up after being down nearly the entire day! I had checked the status in the morning, and it was working. However, when I got to work I couldn’t access it. “Oh great,” I thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So basically I just lost a day of traffic, readership, etc. Great, that just stinks. You know I wonder what my uptime percentage is. I was thinking about it today as a result of not having it available, and I am positive that I am up more than 9 days out of 10. However, I’m pretty sure that I couldn’t claim more than 95%. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, I think that the benefits to running my own web server outweigh the cost. Let me share what I think some of them are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learn more about how the Internet works by becoming more than a user, become a cog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; where all of your data is stored&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t have to pay for hosting costs (okay, okay there is the electricity to run the computer which is definitely something. But you’re not getting charged 15 bucks a month like you normally would be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learn interesting server-related things such as configuring Apache. This is especially interesting for those who have a professional interest in computers I think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it worth it to you? I don’t even know what the percentages are of people who run their own server. I actually don’t know too many people that do. Of course I guess that speaks more about the people that I know than what is actually going on. In any case, sorry for the downtime, and I’m back (for now).&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Music Piracy Makes People Stupid</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid/"/> <updated>2007-05-14T13:12:06-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In an article at Yahoo! about &lt;a href=&quot;http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/43610153&quot;&gt;cracking down on college music pirates&lt;/a&gt;, I read about one Sarah Barg, a sophomore from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It portrayed her as a girl who was just taking part in what everyone else was doing. The article wanted to put her in the role of one who is definitely not the worst (I mean she &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; downloaded 381 songs when others were downloading thousands!). In response to it all, Barg says&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously I knew it was illegal, but no one got in trouble for it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, I know that all higher education is not equal. And I know that maybe not all of them are as good as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsd.edu/&quot;&gt;University of California, San Diego&lt;/a&gt;, but that does not allow for such ridiculous thoughts. I think that ignorance is not a good excuse for doing wrong. The onus is on you to do what’s right. However, I think that actually knowing that something is wrong and yet still doing it speaks of some darker black.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, I don’t think that it’s a matter of intelligence. I think it’s a sign of the times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Piracy does not just affect music as I wrote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/14/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/&quot;&gt;Even Worse Than At First Glance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/04/cheatin-chinese/&quot;&gt;Cheain’ Chinese&lt;/a&gt;, and (in regards to cheating in general) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/&quot;&gt;Cheaters 4 Life&lt;/a&gt;. Wow I did not realize that I had so many entries devoted to ranting about cheaters! But I digress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reasons why you shouldn’t be a (music) pirate:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;You can afford the music (or whatever it is that you’re pirating).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;* If you can&#39;t afford it, you don&#39;t need it. * If you really can&#39;t afford it, you have things that you should be doing other than listening to music anyways. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can support and encourage the artists that you like to keep making music. It’s kind of like writing a blog and getting encouraged by people leaving comments. Except for them it’s people giving them money. I’m applying my energy to the wrong thing. :P&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;You know it’s morally wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s actually against the law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I admit that I’m not perfect, but I would like to think that once I knew the truth then I would change my behavior to match what I know. Not everyone is like this. But they should be. It just makes sense to have your behavior in line with your opinions, does it not? Don’t be the person who gets laughed at for coming off as stupid. Nobody wants 15 minutes of infamy.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Renege</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/renege/"/> <updated>2007-05-14T11:30:18-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/renege</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[ri-&lt;strong&gt;nig&lt;/strong&gt;, -&lt;strong&gt;neg&lt;/strong&gt;, -&lt;strong&gt;neeg&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;To break a rule, go back on one’s word, cheat (especially at cards)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you play hearts, you need to follow suit if you have the suit that is first played.

Many of my readers probably are not very acquainted with the idea. They’re accustomed to doing things for free and because they like it. That’s fine and well, but there is in fact a market for actually making money simply by blogging. Amazing isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well now you might be wondering whether blogging is even worth it as a venture to make money. Let me point your attention to a site that teaches you how you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnchow.com/&quot;&gt;make money online&lt;/a&gt;. Even though right now I’m participating in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnchow.com/make-money-online-review-my-blog/&quot;&gt;a contest&lt;/a&gt; to review his site to get a backlink from his site, this really is a site that I have been subscribing to in my RSS reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To start off with, John Chow is a Canadian resident (whom none of you probably actually know personally) who started trying to turn his blog into a money-maker less than a year ago. He writes articles about how he is making money as well as ideas and tips for other people who would want to do the same. He uses his own site as a case study in how money can be made. In every month since he started his blog, he has enjoyed increased revenue. He is a proponent of a lot of different advertisements and partner deals (including the ubiquitous AdSense which I am using). With the combined revenue from all of his sources, he made a bit under $12,000 in the month of April. It’s pretty amazing to see what someone can do with just a blog! Of course the caveat to this for all of you is that his blog is less of a personal one and more of a targeted one. Nevertheless it’s impressive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although I generally read all of the articles, I think that the main downside that I see to what he is writing about is that he sometimes hits a ceiling in terms of content. Often (simply by the mere subject matter) there will be repetition in his advice so I can see how this blog will be very interesting initially but could lose interest for readers after they have read it for awhile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, I have enjoyed reading about different ideas and methods that he’s used, and I suggest that anyone interested in the topic should take a look at it. This is especially useful for those that are hosting (or paying for hosting) of their own site as there is some cost to running the site.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>What? Ants?!</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/what-ants/"/> <updated>2007-05-11T09:15:40-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/what-ants</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I really like watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://dsc.discovery.com/&quot;&gt;The Discovery Channel&lt;/a&gt;. That makes me think of another show that I really have started to enjoy: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/manvswild/manvswild.html&quot;&gt;Man vs Wild&lt;/a&gt; but that is a whole different entry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tonight I watched parts of Killer Ants and Ant Wars on The Discovery Channel. Of the Formicidae family, ants are infamous around the world. Now I am definitely no fan of these pesky insects, but I am most comfortable watching them from the safety of my home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;siafu-ants&quot;&gt;Siafu Ants&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/493367230_202e5b4338_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;swarm_ants&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the shows that I watched, I learned about an ant that I had not heard much of: the Siafu Ant. Apparently this is a very well-known ant from Africa. Why is it well-known? Well here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They do not stay in the same place for very long, they have to up and move more than once a month. Imagine having to do that!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They form highways before they actually move. The lead parties will stake out a new location and lay a chemical trail for others to follow. They will then clear the path of obstacles and actually create a trench for the new highway so that it will be easier for the large mass to navigate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are at least 3 different classes of Siafu besides the queen and the male. They are differently sized and have different strengths. They range from the large soldier ants with crushing jaws to the small utilitarian ant that can perform any number of duties including cleaning larvae, hunting, and forming the walls of the colonies!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They have to hunt in order to feed the millions of larvae that are produced by the queen monthly. Millions!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;To hunt, they will basically spread out along the forest floor and sweep around the area near the colony. They sense the carbon dioxide that living beings emit in order to find them! As soon as one ant encounters prey, it will release a chemical signal so that others will immediately come to help. They win by sheer power in numbers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh yes, and many of them do not have eyes. They do all of these things just using chemical signals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not on the show, but reading about them online I found that they can intentionally hunt and prey on much larger (well larger than insects) animals! It’s not necessarily common, but it also definitely seems like it happens. Rabbits, vipers, and even a drunk with a broken leg were stories that I read about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;bulldog-ants&quot;&gt;Bulldog Ants&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/230/493367228_3dc6355fc6_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Red_bull_ant&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bulldog ants are not as prominent in the world perhaps, but they are still pretty well known in their native Australia. They are large and independent ants that are in many ways opposite of the Siafu. One of the most interesting things about them is that they have venom that can cause anaphylactic shock! Apparently their venom is one of the most potent of any insect! (Of course this means that it doesn’t include snakes, spiders, etc) However, their nests are small and they will hunt almost strictly individually. However, because they are unafraid of human interaction, there can be literally once a week hospital emergencies on account of a bite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why??&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do I care about all of this? Well besides the fact that it is simply amazing to see these creations doing what they do, I feel like there is so much to learn from them!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are diligent in their work. You don’t see slackers messing around when they should be working. :P&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are willing to give their all for something bigger than themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trust is something that they can inherently do with ease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aspiration to be the greatest (although an admirable trait in some humans) is nonexistent with these creatures. We can learn to be a bit more satisfied with who we are, what we have, and so on instead of always being dissatisfied with every aspect of our lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They get their friends to help them out. Okay so that is just the Siafu…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the bulldog ants are also good as they are so aptly named because they will refuse to let go once they bite. Once you get something good, you don’t let that go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to up and change things around if it’s not working. When the ants run out of food, they will move. Just because you do something that you’ve always done does not mean that you are constrained to continue doing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many more I am sure. I enjoy finding life lessons where there are seemingly none. I also enjoy watching The Discovery Channel.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>No Nofollow!</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/no-nofollow/"/> <updated>2007-05-10T09:15:26-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/no-nofollow</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamelife.com/blogging-its-not-about-everyone-its-about-every-one/&quot;&gt;Rory’s post on hamelife.com&lt;/a&gt; (which I enjoyed because it was very interesting plus my blog got a mention!) I continued surfing and happened upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://dmiracle.com/tools/the-single-most-profound-way-to-thank-your-commenters/&quot;&gt;this post about nofollow links&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I doubt that many of you would want to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow&quot;&gt;the wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; explaining what I’m talking about so I will briefly explain. Search engines (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; among them) have an algorithm that uses the amount of links to your website as a part of how to determine the important of your website (this is called your PageRank in the end). This is, in part, what is used to determine how high you are when searches are done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However to combat people abusing the system, they started to allow you to add an attribute relationship in the links like&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;goingthewongway&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This would then be disregarded in the algorithm to calculate your PageRank. The bottom line is that any links that have that attribute are worth nothing for search engines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a blogger, being read is what’s important! Search engines allow your site to be listed as “more relevant” which could allow more people to find your site and read your content. I don’t write on this blog to understand myself. I write because I like to share my thoughts and get feedback from others. So after reading the article and thinking about it myself, I realized that it definitely encourages more feedback if commenters can get something back. The big popular sites like to do fancy giveaways, but I’m not a big popular site. However, I realized that the least that I could do would be to give anyone who commented a backlink! This helps them because it ever so minutely increases their importance in the eyes of the search engine. And it would hopefully help commenters to have another incentive to leave their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways suffice to say I installed the ever so easy to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://kimmo.suominen.com/sw/dofollow/&quot;&gt;DoFollow&lt;/a&gt; plugin for Wordpress which removes the nofollow attribute for all user-input links (like the website that you list when you leave a comment).

Ah the fight or flight response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A novel stimulus (which could include a perception of danger or an environmental stresser signal such as elevated sound levels or over-illumination), once perceived, is relayed from the sensory cortex of the brain through the thalamus to the brain stem.

It caught my eye because they had an article on helping with your resume. Now granted I already have a job, but I still remember what a pain it was to be searching for a job. At the time, I didn’t have time to read the article on doing a resume makeover, but I bookmarked the page to read at a later time. Boy am I glad that I did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This site is run be a couple of people who have experience in corporate America. They give both their thoughts as well as their advice on topics that might be of use to those of us who are also working in some way. This ranges anywhere from the entrepreneurs to the low man on the totem pole. They have tips on resume writing, on interviewing, as well as a myriad of other topics. All of the posts are well thought out and fairly to the point (often consisting of lists). It’s especially useful reading for those looking for a job. Although the site as a whole reaches out to all of those of us who are working, individual posts aren’t always applicable. But I suppose that wide spectrum of people in the audience dictates that as necessary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, days after initially bookmarking the page I added the site to my RSS reader. And as they say, I haven’t looked back since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few of my favorite posts thus far:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/03/simple-steps-on-how-to-write-a-resume/&quot;&gt;Simple Resume Tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/24/6-resume-tips-for-seasoned-professionals/&quot;&gt;Resume Tips For Seasoned Professionals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/11/ways-to-save-one-dollar-a-week/&quot;&gt;Money Saving Tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re having &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/05/03/review-career-ramblings-for-a-backlink/&quot;&gt;a promotion where you link&lt;/a&gt; to their site as well as write a review. This essentially raises your online profile by providing their readers with a link to your site, and it also raises their ranking in search engines that use backlinks as a method by which to calculate “importance.” This is fairly beneficial for both parties involved. And even though they might have gotten the idea from a certain site about how to make money online by blogging ( ;-) ), I still think it’s a useful endeavor because this site is useful for nearly everyone out there!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>You Get To See Some Statistics</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/you-get-to-see-some-statistics/"/> <updated>2007-05-04T22:38:13-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/you-get-to-see-some-statistics</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So just to let you know, I made a statistics page available for readers to peruse. It lists general information such as how many posts and how many comments. The most interesting statistic (in my opinion) is the list of the commentors and how many comments they have left. However, I must admit that the commenting seems to be fairly unevenly weighted. Does that make you want to do anything on my posts? ;-)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, check out the “Statistics” page in the navbar.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Cheatin' Chinese</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/cheatin-chinese/"/> <updated>2007-05-04T11:08:17-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/cheatin-chinese</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Chinese people do good things. Sometimes Chinese people do bad things. And sometimes Chinese people sure do some stupid things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get this: Chinese people copied Disneyland. As in, they made a Disneyland &lt;strong&gt;park&lt;/strong&gt;. Are you kidding me?!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/04/keepin-it-real-fake-part-lv-disneyland/&quot;&gt;an Engadget article about the fake Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; that got me to searching for more information. Amusingly, they have characters that closely mimic the Disney ones as well as rides that indicate how much of a fake it is. Their slogan (according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=20&amp;amp;art_id=41990&amp;amp;sid=13078355&amp;amp;con_type=1&amp;amp;d_str=20070411&quot;&gt;this other article&lt;/a&gt;) is that “Disneyland is too far.” Wow, that is unbelievable. I think that actually the most amusing thing about Beijing’s Shijingshan Amusement Park is that its website is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bs-amusement-park.com&quot;&gt;http://www.bs-amusement-park.com&lt;/a&gt;. Haha you read that right, it’s the BS amusement park.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although pretty humorous, this actually touches on a more serious issue (which was touched on at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/14/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/&quot;&gt;Even Worse Than At First Glance&lt;/a&gt;).

I enjoyed watching them tear up the Heat. Although I don’t think that I hold any ill feelings toward Shaquille O’Neal for leaving the Lakers, I’m not a big Heat fan. I’m not even sure what it is. I just don’t really care for them. I think that Wade is overrated (although good), and the rest of the team is just a bunch of cocky goons (namely Antoine Walker).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;golden-state-warriors-vs-dallas-mavericks&quot;&gt;Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though never really a fan of the Warriors, I’ve also never really been opposed to them. I’ve enjoyed watching their series against the Mavericks. However, I thought it quite disappointing that they couldn’t close out against them last night with a &lt;strong&gt;nine&lt;/strong&gt; point lead with a few minutes left! That’s too bad. I’m a fan of how strong Baron Davis and Jason Richardson are playing. I’m not really a fan of Stephen Jackson because I think that he’s a crybaby. And Al Harrington? Forgot to show up. Here’s hoping that they close it out for real next time and send Mark Cuban &amp;amp; Co. packing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;los-angeles-lakers-vs-phoenix-suns&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Lakers vs Phoenix Suns&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll always be a fan of the Lakers. But they have been straight-up disappointing nearly the entire year! Kobe is pretty amazing sometimes (everyone &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to admit that), but he both can’t do everything and can’t always be so amazing. Until they either get a real team or they learn to work together consistently, they won’t ever get very far in the playoffs. All of the other teams are just too good to monkey around every night. I’ll be cheering for the Suns in a week (even though they talked a little too much before the series started about how they’d steamroll the Lakers).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;cleveland-cavaliers-vs-washington-wizards&quot;&gt;Cleveland Cavaliers vs Washington Wizards&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I watched part of the game on Sunday. I fell asleep. That’s pretty much all you need to know about this series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;denver-nuggets-vs-san-antonio-spurs&quot;&gt;Denver Nuggets vs San Antonio Spurs&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thought the Nuggets could pull something off, especially after the first game. But the Spurs seem relentless. And Robert Horry must dream throughout the entire season about making those big playoff shots. The series isn’t that close, but it’s still fairly entertaining.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;new-jersey-nets-vs-toronto-raptors&quot;&gt;New Jersey Nets vs Toronto Raptors&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the Nets should have been finished with the series already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;orlando-magic-vs-detroit-pistons&quot;&gt;Orlando Magic vs Detroit Pistons&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why did they even have to play this series? I thought they would be better. But the Magic players never showed up at the same time. Something must have been wrong with their alarm clocks. Maybe they need five alarms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;houston-rockets-vs-utah-jazz&quot;&gt;Houston Rockets vs Utah Jazz&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rooting for the Rockets. They have showed glimpses of how far they could go with their 1-2 combo of McGrady and Yao. However, it hasn’t been consistent enough to knock out the Jazz yet. Chinese guy? I’m for the Rockets. Plus they’ve got &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafer_Alston&quot;&gt;Skip To My Lou&lt;/a&gt;! You’ve gotta cheer for that guy. Even if he does have the worst Field Goal % in the NBA.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Tweedle Dee, Twitter Dumb</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/tweedle-dee-twitter-dumb/"/> <updated>2007-05-01T12:25:41-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/tweedle-dee-twitter-dumb</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Maybe as a result of being out of school, I feel like I am somewhat out of the loop on the latest happenings. When I was in school, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanga.com/&quot;&gt;Xanga&lt;/a&gt; was something that I knew about even before it got big. Likewise with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and so on. However, I feel as if I’ve been a little bit late learning about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those in the know, you can probably skip this paragraph. Basically Twitter is a new service that is meant for people to basically say what they are doing at a precise moment: now. Whatever you are doing, Twitter is a way by which you can let others know what it is that you are doing. You can do this via cellular phone (by way of text message), instant messenger, or on their website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s all there is to it. Pretty simple right? Well I think that it’s dumb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is lots to be said for what a marvelous job they have done using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_rails&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; as the platform on which they developed their service. I mean just imagine having to deal with possibly thousands and thousands of tiny connections every second. The effort put into the software engineering is impressive to say the least.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I think that the service is fairly horrendous in terms of what it means for people. There are some people out there who really do enjoy knowing about what all of their friends (and strangers for that matter) are doing every second of every day. But I think that this is just a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litmus&quot;&gt;Litmus Test&lt;/a&gt; for society as a whole. In a society of cellular phones, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackberry.com/&quot;&gt;Blackberrys&lt;/a&gt;, and the like, we are forever on the go and busy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that people need to take a step back and realize that it is so ridiculous to have all of these contraptions. Sure I have a great admiration for the engineering and development that all of these products represent. I even have a respect for the situations when they are actually necessary. But in terms of actual worth for the great herd we call “the public”, I think they are fairly detrimental to the well-being of people. Do you think that the people in the United States of America are any happier with their gadgets than tribesmen in some far off corner of the earth? Well they might think so, but who’s to say?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even more than happiness, I say that all of these things are making us constantly bored. How can that be? In so being always prone to want to fill the time with checking e-mail or answering the phone, we have become people that always need to do something. And when we don’t have something to do, we are bored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are more important things, and I think that we all know this deep within. Have you ever thought that spending time with those around you is more important than answering your cellular phone right away? As I once heard&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s why voicemail was invented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;E-mail is convenient and easy, but a letter is still desirable because of the fact that it takes time and energy to write one. Think about these things the next time it comes up in your life. I try to do so in mine. I won’t interrupt a conversation just to answer the phone, and I know that there is a time and a place for when e-mail is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter is a cool product/service, but I for one think that it’s continuing in the grand tradition of leading humans down the wrong road. It’s making us bored as we’re waiting for another instant Twitter update. It makes us want to sit in front of the computer or stare at our cellular phone even more. It is making people more connected to their devices and less connected to other people in a real, tangible manner. Basically, &lt;strong&gt;Twitter is dumb&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Some People</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/some-people/"/> <updated>2007-04-30T12:04:24-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/some-people</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/30/the-steampunk-mouse-and-the-mouse-mouse/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/&quot;&gt;Engadget&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought it suitably disturbing to write a post about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check out the original article that Engadget is just reposting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instructables.com/id/EM1O9XJF0YPF7M5/&quot;&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instructables.com/&quot;&gt;Instructables.com&lt;/a&gt; (which is a super site with lots of things for those of the DIY variety). There is an instruction video that will let you perform the same modification. However, I think that more people will just be interested in seeing what I’m talking about. So without further ado, here are some pictures!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/226/478636125_0ca99b18e7_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mouse_before&quot; /&gt; A glimpse of the parts beforehand. That’s nasty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/478636119_3aea1e52e8_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mouse_done&quot; /&gt; Here is the finished product after inserting the (computer) mouse into the (real) mouse. Oh yum. &lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/185/478636121_f16d110447_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mouse_in_use&quot; /&gt; And here it is being used by someone’s hand. Who knows who that is. All I know is that I don’t want that to be my hand. And I don’t want to shake their hand either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So there have some of the interesting pictures that I saw over at Instructables. That is disgusting, but I think that is still fairly cool. Why is that cool? Well just imagine how much &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; disgusted everyone else would be if they saw you use it. I could see how this could be the source of many many practical jokes. Find it gross, find it humorous, or find it useful.

Anyways, I just wanted to say that I am not getting a new car or am involved in the process at all. It’s mere coincidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, onward with the post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I don’t know about most people, but I do know about me. And one thing that I know is that I absolutely cannot stand it when I can’t figure something out. For example, I cannot stand it when I lose something because that is in essence a puzzle (the location of something) that I cannot figure out. It will consume me to no end!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So for the past couple of months, I have been slightly perturbed by a puzzle. No it’s not a puzzle in the normal sense. Basically I would drive around southern California and obviously see lots of cars. Now occasionally I would see something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/213/473834904_46f6265569_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;op.permit&quot; /&gt; I blurred out the important information because I just yanked the picture from some random site.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I always wondered what it was. Now obviously you can see what it is now because I found a picture for you and it’s not moving at 70 mph. But imagine it as something 6 inches square and on the back window of a car and moving exceptionally fast. Plus you don’t want to get too close to it else you might get into an accident! And although I would see them around some of the time, I never really saw them in a context by which I could actually look at it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so my mind imagined what it could be. Some of the things that I thought of were:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a secret club for something and that badge indicates that they’re in the club&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;My eyes were playing tricks on me&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a new hip brand of clothing/auto accessories/whatever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a humorous bumper sticker type thing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;So basically my mind would stew about it for a few minutes every time that I saw one of these things. And this went on for a couple of months! Of course I tried to remedy this all by searching for it on the Internet, but you can imagine how hard it would be to find it. Basically all I knew was that:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was red&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It had a number on it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was on the back of cars&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now those are some pretty broad and sweeping search terms by which my search engines could not help me with. Alas, I was to be forever confounded…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until &lt;strong&gt;finally&lt;/strong&gt; one Sunday I saw one of these on the back of a car in the parking lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fcbc.org/&quot;&gt;First Chinese Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt;. I took the minute or so to read it and discovered that it’s a DMV Temporary Operating Permit! I promptly felt satisfaction seep over me like a gentle wave. :P But truly I do enjoy it when things make sense, and those moments when realization set in are very nice indeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even with the knowledge of what these were, it was still hard to find information about them online. I must admit that I still don’t know all that there is to know about these, but I don’t really care that much anymore because I know &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; they are. Hopefully if someone is in the same conundrum as I was, they will happen upon this page and be satisfied as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, it’s interesting because I’m like that with other things as well. The truth really does set you free!

Thus it would be hard for people to have snuck in and successfully got back the pages that they were looking for without timing out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then sometime early this morning, my home DSL connection somehow died. And I didn’t realize this until I was at work. And that meant that nobody was physically around to restart everything. Ah the downfalls of hosting your own site on a home connection. It was pretty good for quite sometime. I didn’t need to restart (and renew my IP address) for possibly a month or two? That’s pretty good. Well at least for me anyways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, back to our regularly scheduled program!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>13 Super Wordpress Plugins</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/13-super-wordpress-plugins/"/> <updated>2007-04-26T10:46:43-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/13-super-wordpress-plugins</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of Wordpress plugins that I both use and recommend to anyone who is interested. It’s not exactly a typical setup (but then again what fun what a “normal” setup be?). Even if you don’t have a Wordpress blog, feel free to read the list and find out about some of the software that is powering this blog. Maybe you’ll discover some features that you didn’t know about!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And onward (not in order of preference or importance but rather just so that you can make sure that I have 13).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://akismet.com&quot;&gt;Akismet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ubiquitous spam comment catcher for the Wordpress community. It’s so popular and well-done that it’s a default plugin. I didn’t actually activate it initially because I didn’t think that I needed it as my blog doesn’t have extensive traffic. And thus I didn’t think that I would get picked up by any spammers. Of course I turned out to be wrong. And of course I got spammed hundreds of times. And of course it happened while I was on vacation. Ah ‘tis life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ryanlee.org/software/wp/croissanga/&quot;&gt;Croissanga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not a normal plugin to have I would think. But this is definitely a crucial one on my blog because of the community (small as it is) that I have on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanga.com/&quot;&gt;xanga&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed installing it because it allowed me to learn about &lt;a href=&quot;http://php.net/curl&quot;&gt;PHP cURL&lt;/a&gt; (which is basically a way for you to access remote sites through PHP!). Additionally it definitely upped my readership and got the word out there about my blog. This is better than having to tell people about it. It gets old telling people to check out my blog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With some fairly prompt response to my report that Croissanga wasn’t working (within the week), Ryan stepped up and pushed out a new version to handle the changes. That is just sweet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-plugin/&quot;&gt;Feedburner Feed Replacement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Replacing the default RSS feed is useful because you can track more information by sending the feed through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com&quot;&gt;Feedburner&lt;/a&gt;. Very easy to set up, and there are some interesting things that you can learn through them that you wouldn’t if you hosted your RSS feed on your own site.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jodies.de/archiv/2004/11/13/recent-comments/&quot;&gt;Get Recent Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a very useful plugin, in my opinion, because it gives you the ability to bring the comments part of your blog to the front and center (the main home of your blog). I encountered this by seeing it on other people’s blogs and thinking that it was very handy. You know when I publish a new post, and now you can know when someone else adds a new comment!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.lipidity.com/feature/wp-plugin-gregarious&quot;&gt;Gregarious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is something that is very hot lately in the world of the Internet. If you haven’t heard of it, it’s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Bookmarking&quot;&gt;social bookmarking&lt;/a&gt;. Basically it’s a way for people to share what they find interesting with other people. This plugin allows your posts, pages, etc to have an instant connection with such sites as &lt;a href=&quot;http://digg.com&quot;&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddit.com&quot;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;. I have this on my blog because I think that it’s cool and I try to participate in social bookmarking. However, I hardly think that my content is the type of stuff that will get put onto these sites. But if you feel that it is, feel very free to use the links on the side of each post!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Worked with the author a little on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/08/i-want-to-share-this/&quot;&gt;fixing a slight bug&lt;/a&gt; with the plugin, and I really appreciated Ankur’s responsiveness and work to fix it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mattread.com/projects/wp-plugins/more-smilies-plugin/&quot;&gt;More Smilies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;A plugin that allows you to choose different smilies to use in your blog. Basic and useful if you’re into customizing things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.wp-plugins.org/widgets/trunk&quot;&gt;Sidebar Widgets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a big deal right now in the Wordpress community. Basically it allows you to have drag-and-drop functionality in your sidebar when you’re setting things up! A &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget&quot;&gt;widget&lt;/a&gt; (in the web sense) is an arbitrary piece of code that conforms to some standards and can be dropped into place without any changes. This is a good way of approaching software projects (where you can just substitute in a component for another component and nothing will know about it), and it’s also a good way of approaching third party software like plugins. I am not currently using this too much, but I have every intention of doing so once I finish re-organizing the structure of the site. I might also have to write my own widget(s) if there isn’t one to do what I want. How fun! But this is seriously a plugin that you should use because it just makes customizing Wordpress even easier than it was before!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://citizenk.wordpress.com/wp-plugins/statcounter-for-wordpress/&quot;&gt;StatCounter for Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;An easy way to utilize a free service (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statcounter.com&quot;&gt;statcounter&lt;/a&gt;) easily without having to muck around in the source code. This keeps the code clean while simply adding an action to the Wordpress functions. This appends the necessary code on each page and thus allows you to keep track of all of your pages! Very useful for those that like to know what is going on in terms of page loads, hits, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/&quot;&gt;Subscribe To Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is an interesting plugin that I saw first-hand while looking at someone else’s blog. I was interested in it because I found it interesting to stay “in the loop” to the comments that were posted as follow-up discussion to the post that I was reading. Basically you check a box when you’re leaving a comment, and you will get an e-mail when a new comment is posted. Pretty nifty if you ask me!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/&quot;&gt;The Ultimate Tag Warrior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well first of all the name is just awesome, in my opinion. Additionally, I think that the functionality is pretty amazing. Basically it allows you to tag your posts with tags that you create. Continue to tag your posts and eventually you’ll end up with a list of tags that somewhat accurately (depending on how good you are at tagging) will represent what your site is generally about. I really enjoy the tag cloud in the sidebar because it gives a visual representation to how often I tag about certain things. And from there, if any particular tag is clicked, a new page will display that shows all of the posts that have that tag. Pretty nifty, if you ask me! There are numerous other ways to display aggregate tag information, but the plugin is even useful if you just want the tags to display for each post! It kind of gives a summary of what the post is about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lesterchan.net/wordpress/readme/wp-stats.html&quot;&gt;WP-Stats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This plugin gives a you some statistics to your blog such as number of posts, number of commentators, and the like. Even though the information isn’t exactly ground-breaking, it’s still nice to just have a plugin that will allow you to easily see it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/random-redirect/&quot;&gt;Random Redirect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a really simple plugin in both idea and code. Basically it allows you to visit http://www.yoursite.com/?random and it will take you to a random post. I have yet to actually put a link somewhere to use this plugin, but I very much mean to sometime soon. If you’d like to, you can try it using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/?random&quot;&gt;a link to a random post on this site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/&quot;&gt;WP-Cache&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although my site doesn’t exactly get hammered because of all of the traffic, I would still say that this is a great plugin to have. Basically it will save pages as they’re visited to a flat file. What does this do for you, you might ask. Well a flat file is much easier to serve than a dynamic page generated from PHP and MySQL. Thus your server will have less processing to do, and it will be able to serve the page more quickly! Even if your site doesn’t get a lot of traffic to actually utilize this plugin, there’s no difference if you do or do not have it. So I say that you might as well install it. Who knows, maybe you will get your site submitted to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digg.com&quot;&gt;digg&lt;/a&gt;, and with this plugin you might be able to withstand the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg_effect&quot;&gt;digg effect&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am very grateful to the respective authors of these plugins because it’s amazing to see how a community (such as the Wordpress one) can make amazing products that are so functional. I’ve enjoyed hacking around and making them do what I want them to do, but this is by no means an end to configuring my blog exactly how I want it. This is just a snapshot of my blog.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Car Salesmen Definitely Earn Their Reputation</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/car-salesmen-definitely-earn-their-reputation/"/> <updated>2007-04-25T11:30:15-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/car-salesmen-definitely-earn-their-reputation</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you like car salesmen? I don’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re pushy, they’re slightly overbearing, and they only want to be your friends to make money off of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Case in point:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I read an article about an incident that outraged me. It also solidified my distaste for car salesmen. In the May 2007 edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caranddriver.com/&quot;&gt;Car and Driver&lt;/a&gt; magazine, I saw an article about a man who went into a dealership to buy a car. He ended up buying a GMC Canyon. This man was mentally disabled (he was later reported to have had feces-covered pants on) with a reported IQ (from a relative) of 70.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To buy the Canyon, the man paid in cash (approximately $30,000) and ended up telling the salesman that he actually had a lot more cash at home. Granted this isn’t exactly a wise thing to do, but this man was also understandably mentally disabled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Events proceeded and the man one day thought that his truck had been stolen (when in fact it turned out to have been towed). He called up his salesman buddy for a ride who then took him to the tow yard. While driving him, the other salesmen who had conspired together proceeded to go to the man’s home and steal the money. They ended up leaving with $70,000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The police then came to the house to investigate the crime and upon finding feces throughout the house, had the mentally disabled man committed to an institute. A salesman kindly took the time to go to the institute, get the man to sign over the Canyon to &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, and charged him for the time that it took to do so!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subsequently, lawsuits were brought against many of the salesmen, the dealership returned the $100,000 to the man, and some semblance of justice was served.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, I am still not impressed with salesmen. &lt;strong&gt;Especially&lt;/strong&gt; those of the car variety.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Man Cuts It Off In Restaurant</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/man-cuts-it-off-in-restaurant/"/> <updated>2007-04-24T14:45:07-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/man-cuts-it-off-in-restaurant</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People are ridiculous. It’s amazing. I don’t even need to cut this entry short because I am speechless at such an act. Imagine yourself out eating dinner at a nice place. Then a man runs in. And then that man proceeds to storm a kitchen, grab a knife, and cut himself. Even more shockingly, he cuts off his own penis. Are you kidding me?!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’d like, you can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6586879.stm&quot;&gt;the original article&lt;/a&gt;.

Take passport pictures for example. There are specifications and guidelines such that most people won’t really want to study them in order to make their own pictures. So because of that, they’ll gladly just pay someone 8 bucks (or whatever it is) for a couple of 2” x 2” pictures of their face. Outrageous! Good thing you have other options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted to make some passport pictures for &lt;a href=&quot;http://redbricks.xanga.com/&quot;&gt;someone that I know&lt;/a&gt; because she needed more than the usual 2. Because of that, I’m not sure how much it would cost. And on top of that, I always thought it was unfortunate how much places would charge you for passport pictures anyways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I searched online, and I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dpchallenge.com/tutorial.php?TUTORIAL_ID=22&quot;&gt;this great tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that shows you how to make your own passport pictures! I followed the tutorial, but I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gimp.org/&quot;&gt;the Gimp&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Gimp (Gnu Image Manipulation Program) is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/RGY3pA&quot;&gt;Adobe Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; replacement that is both open-source AND free. That means that all of you cheap suckers out there can use this for nothing instead of that hacked version of Photoshop that you’re currently running (which is illegal both in law and in spirit). It’s also pretty robust in my opinion, but then again I’m not wizard at image manipulation anyways. Anyways, the Gimp has all of the necessary tools available but here are some helpful pointers from a beginner who already has done it. I didn’t want to just put the whole tutorial here because I didn’t make it. If you want to use it, then go there. However, for some completeness the steps are basically:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-steps&quot;&gt;Basic Steps&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Measure from the chin to the top of the head to get the number of pixels.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Calculate the DPI (dots per inch) that you’ll need for your particular picture because in the end you’ll need 1-1.375 inches from the chin to the top of the head. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Divide measured pixels from chin to the top of the head by how many inches you want (from 1 to 1.375 inches). That gives you pixels/inches which is the same as DPI.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Do a fixed size select. Since you want a 2” x 2” picture in the end, you’ll have to multiply the DPI that you previously got by 2. So if you calculated a DPI of 530 as in the tutorial, then you would do a fixed size select of 1060 by 1060. Copy the selected area.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a new file with a size of 4” x 6” (or whatever size you want, I actually made an 8.5” x 11”). Then change the resolution to whatever your DPI is.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Paste however many pictures you need from your fixed size selection to the new file. Position them so that you’ll have room to cut them out, etc&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You’re done!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;helpful-hints&quot;&gt;Helpful Hints&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/221/471460304_170c90bfff_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;measure_tool&quot; /&gt; The measuring tool is located in the toolbox as indicated. It works similarly to the Photoshop tool in the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/170/471460310_ddc25bdc26_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fixed_size&quot; /&gt; When using the rectangle select, you don’t have to use the free select. Use the fixed size option as shown here (after doing the calculations in the tutorial).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/183/471460290_754e33b34b_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;new_image&quot; /&gt; Make sure to specify the new file in inches according to how you want to print it. Then the resolution should be made to equal your DPI (this makes sure that your picture will turn out to be the right size).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, not to sound like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/fanaticism/&quot;&gt;a fanatic&lt;/a&gt; but long live open source software! :D&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Update: if you specifically want a U.S. passport picture, the State Department has &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.state.gov/_res/flash/cropper/FIG_cropper.html&quot;&gt;this Adobe Flash tool&lt;/a&gt;, which is extremely easy to use!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Worth The Wait</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/worth-the-wait/"/> <updated>2007-04-23T15:25:15-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/worth-the-wait</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to wait But I don’t know if I can stay strong.

I’m assuming that there are many of them out there. Now personally I am not a big fan of it. Not because it’s inconvenient or useless but rather because I don’t appreciate getting “nickeled and dimed” (in this case literally). You might say that’s cheap, but that’s just the truth. I don’t appreciate paying for the cell phone plan and on top of that getting charged the lousy 10 cents to both send &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; receive a text message (of course this is more specific to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verizonwireless.com/&quot;&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; than it is to all cellular phone carriers in the United States. Anyways, enough about my personal feelings about texting. The real reason that I thought about texting today was because I read about Miss Morga Pozgar who is now the reigning texting champion!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I read about this last night in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/22/morgan-pozgar-wins-texting-championship-for-cheaters/&quot;&gt;an Engadget article&lt;/a&gt;, and I could hardly believe that they even have this competition! I think that the world is ridiculous because they sponsor such things. They give money to the person who is the quickest to type out long words. How can there be many people who would try for such a thing (okay granted I think that if I had known about it then I would try for it and see if I could win $25,000 for doing essentially nothing). But it’s amazing to see the kinds of things that go on in the world out of my eyes. Utterly amazing.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>The Long And Short Of It</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-long-and-short-of-it/"/> <updated>2007-04-20T14:43:09-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-long-and-short-of-it</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People don’t care what you have to do, just get it done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed someone’s eyes drift or glaze over when you would be explaining something to them? Well it could be that you’re just boring them to death. But I was thinking about when I would occasionally be explaining why or how I got from point A to point B.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Say for instance someone were to be interested in how you happened to come from the point you were at 5 years ago to this point right now. You would think about all of the different things that have happened, good and bad, small and little. You would want to talk about every little incident to truly show how or why or when you did what you did. But more often than not, it seems as if that person wants to basically just know a summary of the journey. They don’t want to hear how you felt 10 days after you experience unrequited love or how you felt during that all-nighter that would seemingly determine your future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s like that in the real world, too. It’s very accurate, in my opinion, to say that people just want you to get something done. They don’t want to hear about all of the problems that you had while getting there. At work, they will be much more interested in a final project (whether that’s a report or a program or a piece of art) than they will be in how you arrived at said destination. They don’t want to know how there was this tiny bug in your program that you couldn’t find for the longest time. They don’t want to know how you messed up the formatting of something and had to start over. I remember at a previous job that I had, we would have weekly lunch meetings where the new people would introduce themselves. A new guy on my team joined and there was the requisite introduction made along with the invitation to talk about what he did/was going to do at the company. This guy (who admittedly might have been slightly out of touch with American social norms because he seemed like he had not been born there) promptly got into talking about what he had done in the past week to get a particular function to work. He went on about how hard it was to figure it out but ended with saying that it looked promising and he was making headway. Want to know what I said when I introduced myself? I said, “I’m a student at UCSD studying Computer Science.” So you can imagine how I cringed at seeing him talk endlessly, which sent everyone in the room (temporarily) to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu&quot;&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another example is my morning routine. I have five alarms set each day. Now you must be wondering why I would have such a thing. Everyone is different, and here is what works for me:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have my first alarm go off at a pleasant level of noise to the news on the radio on a clock radio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;My second and third are tunes that are progressively louder on my cell phone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fourth is a shrill and loud alarm on my cell phone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fifth is a very loud and annoying alarm on the clock radio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wow this seems like a lot to me when I read it. However, I figure that this covers me for cases of when I am very tired (can’t get up at the first one or two alarms), and it also covers me for disasters (either my cell phone runs out of a battery or the electricity goes out). Do people care about this? Not really at all. In fact &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanga.com/TuMbaLiNa3&quot;&gt;some people&lt;/a&gt; often question why I do the things that I do. But what’s really important and what do people really care about? Whether I got up in time or not!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So basically, people don’t want to hear the details of the journey most of the time. This does not mean that the journey is not important. In fact, the journey is immensely important. However in many cases, people want to know the destination and end. They want the synopsis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That makes it all the more important to take note of this: &lt;strong&gt;if you find someone who is interested in the entire journey, you just found a “keeper.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>They'll Always Be The Same</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/theyll-always-be-the-same/"/> <updated>2007-04-18T14:01:31-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/theyll-always-be-the-same</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Because of computers, life has changed over the years. They hold the promise of many things. Quicker processing, automated functions, extensive memory are just a few of the available positives of them. While they have changed and are continuing to change, people do not change quite as much. Sure we change because now we know how to find things online whilst 20 years ago the common person did not. However, the very essence of people will not change. Take today for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/18/pf/taxes/intuit_turbotax/?postversion=2007041811&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; that I read, we see just how people do not change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of years ago, the roads must have been clogged with people traveling by foot/horse to get to the local magistrate to pay their taxes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Years ago, the post office was jam packed with lines out the door as people stood in line to mail their taxes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today (figuratively, yesterday literally) countless people try to file their taxes in the hours before the tax deadline and clog up the servers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is amusing to see that people will truly not change. If they can do things faster then do they finish them faster? No, they wait to start it later. People never learn. We truly are running around in circles and simply staying in the same place.

Well, at least it seems like they do a lot of things well. Maybe in hundreds of years people will think back upon our times and scoff at how poorly we existed. That’s kind of how we look back on other time periods isn’t it? Using a port-a-potty is bad enough, but a bedpan or an outhouse? No way! Using candles instead of having electricity? Completely necessary! But I digress (as usual). Something that makes me angry is that people &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; too good at things. They are good at wanting as much money as possible. They are good at looking out for #1. They are good at being sneaky. They are good at marketing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What brings on this rant? Well the gas stations! You might think, “how in the world do gas stations market?” Well I have some beef with gas stations. Okay so maybe I also just have a problem with how gas is very expensive (and going up). Nevertheless have you ever noticed the prices for gas? Sure sure, we all know that they are currently low to mid $3 per gallon. But have you ever noticed that it’s always something like $3.199? Do you realize that’s essentially $3.20?! If you think that I’m being stupid, then that’s your prerogative, but I think that’s slightly outrageous. Do they really need to get that last 0.9 ¢?? And we are silly and oblige because we have to. How unfortunate to be bound to something (gasoline) so tightly!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Too bad ranting and raving will do nothing to stop this practice. It’s absolutely worthless. I wonder who is getting rich from the 0.9 ¢ extra from every single gallon pumped. They sure must be rich.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Castigate</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/castigate/"/> <updated>2007-04-16T11:30:24-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/castigate</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;kas&lt;/strong&gt;-ti-geyt]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;To strongly criticize or reprimand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;After running into the street, some people think that the parents should just send them to the corner, but others are of the mind that the child should be castigated in order to more strongly deter future injurious behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using a new word instead of criticize seems like an attractive possibility.

Of course, we are presented with many decisions each and every single day, but I am talking about a particular decision. The decision that I am talking about is what to wear. We try to match clothes based on the society-specified norms of matching colors and matching patterns. We know that jeans match pretty much everything, do not wear brown with black, iron out the wrinkles in the clothes, and so on and so forth. Why do we do these things? Does it intrinsically make us better people? No, not really. Do they, at the very root of the matter, make us more acceptable to the world? I would venture to say that is the case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you really think about it, that is very much what we are doing. We are trying to be accepted by the world. But I am not saying that it’s necessarily a bad thing (although it definitely sounds like it from what I just said). The real reason why I bring this up is actually not obvious at first glance. I want to specifically address choosing your accessories. Though this might be more specifically applicable to those of the fairer sex, it can definitely be taken to apply to anybody’s life. Almost all women that I know will carry a purse with them whenever they go out. They have their fancy purses for going out when they’re dressed up, and they have their casual bags for when they’re just out running errands. Whatever the case, I feel as if I have seen that there are a large number of women that I know that have this decision to make.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want to address something that I only recently really thought of because of some comments that I recently heard. Now first off, there are many, many bag makers out there. There’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coach.com/&quot;&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dooney.com/&quot;&gt;Dooney and Burke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prada.com/&quot;&gt;Prada&lt;/a&gt; (what kind of a site is that with &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a picture??), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuitton.com/&quot;&gt;Louis Vuitton&lt;/a&gt; and so many more (I claim the defense of having sisters as the reason for knowing all of these). There are probably a lot of people out there who have a problem with how expensive these purses are. I mean, $300 for a bag that can’t even carry a classic novel is pretty amazing. I still think that’s pretty ridiculous. But even more extreme than that stance is the one where the people that carry these bags are being wordly and shallow. Now this might be true. I’m sure that it is for some people. And at this point I am certain that some people will be thinking “but, Derek, it’s worth it because of the exceptional build quality!” But that is a debate for another time. The reason that I bring up the fact that some people think these things is because I want to bring up another thought. I want to say that people who despise the worldliness of these bags but wear fake bags are even more worldly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By buying fake bags and wearing them as if they were real, I want to propose the idea that these people are trying even harder to please the world than anybody else. Of course on top of being more worldly, they are harming the innovative industries that produce these bags. But I digress. So I think that there is a place for thriftiness in this world, but I have come to have a fair amount of opposition to those that partake in purchasing fake things (such as purses). The reason that I think that these people are even more worldly is that they can’t even claim to have bought these purses for the right reasons (spending their money on something that is actually better quality and some would say a better value than buying many bags at a cheaper price). All they can say is that they bought it for cheaper. They bought it for cheaper even when they could have obviously bought an equally cheap bag that did not have deceptive designs and logos on it which were put there to meant to imitate the more expensive bags. Instead, they bought the fake designer bag in order to purposely try to put up a front. And for that they earn the derision that they deserve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you think that this doesn’t apply to you? Well you should probably think about it again. Fake clothes are equally if not more of a culprit. And in this area, all people are susceptible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do people do it? Why do we want other people to like us and accept us more? At the very root of the matter is perhaps a discomfort with who we are. A deficiency in self-confidence at the very core of who we are might be to blame. It might take some digging to get at the root, but just like all plants there is always a root somewhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does this mean that we should not buy anything more expensive than the cheapest clothes and the cheapest purses? No, I don’t think that’s the lesson to be learned from this. I read one time an opinion piece talking about finances and being responsible for your decisions. The author (whom I don’t remember) said that we focus on things that seem outrageous in an absolute sense. We all point out the people that buy cars from Lamborghini or designer clothes as being the most worldly and sinful. But this same author pointed out the fact that even though the Bible has many passages about money, it doesn’t actually say that it’s universally bad for people to have money. And this author points out that it’s actually more in line with what’s written to take the position that it’s not how much you have, but how well you are taking care of what you have. And if that’s true, then the person who buys Starbucks coffee everyday at $3 when they have high-interest credit card debt is as bad (and probably worse) than the person who has saved and bought the fancy new car well within their means. That sounds like it’s going out on a limb. So read it and take it if it’s good or leave it if you disagree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What can we learn from this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t hurt the innovative industries by supporting the copycats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Always evaluate why we are buying what we are buying (and why we’re spending our time, etc)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Live within your means, &lt;strong&gt;whatever&lt;/strong&gt; those means might be&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do not let money take over your life. It is so easy a trap to fall into. Fight it with everything within you because there is so much more to life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Up Or Down, Same Difference</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/up-or-down-same-difference/"/> <updated>2007-04-13T09:50:21-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/up-or-down-same-difference</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it strange how when someone suggests something, and you can respond by saying “I’m &lt;strong&gt;up&lt;/strong&gt; for that” or “I’m &lt;strong&gt;down&lt;/strong&gt; for that” it will be interpreted with exactly the same meaning?&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>I'm Willing If You Are</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/im-willing-if-you-are/"/> <updated>2007-04-12T12:56:04-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/im-willing-if-you-are</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, it is difficult to persuade other people to do things. Whenever you want someone to do something for you (or for anyone for that matter), it can easily be seen that there is some opposition (small as it may be). It doesn’t even really matter what it is. It’s merely the fact that they’re being asked to do more than they expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve discovered a solution of sorts in the last few years. So perhaps it’s not exactly a solution so much as it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/tag/tip-for-life&quot;&gt;tip for life&lt;/a&gt;. Basically I have found that people are much more willing to do what you’re asking of them if you’re also willing to do a part. If you want someone to drive you somewhere, they’d be much more willing if you drove to their place and offered money for gas (which is getting ridiculously expensive, in my honest opinion). If you want someone to clean, you are going to have to get down and dirty as well. If you want someone to run an errand for you, they’d be more amicable if you’re someone who has done errands for you. The examples go on and on, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now this obviously will not work with everyone in the world. But it is something that I think some people could learn from. Nobody wants to be bossed about as if they mean nothing. So you can’t expect people to go 100% while you go 0%. Think about it, and see if it works for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Start to do things for yourself and thus &lt;strong&gt;become the better person&lt;/strong&gt; simply because it pays off in a lifetime of independence and rewards.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>What Could Be</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/what-could-be/"/> <updated>2007-04-11T10:17:57-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/what-could-be</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you been &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancingwiththestars/index&quot;&gt;Dancing With The Stars&lt;/a&gt;? I’d rather travel to Mars. Oh how fun that’d be! Perhaps instead I’ll cross the sea. To the tropical vacation of fame Maybe there find a classic dame? Or maybe win a trip to the country of my roots. Where I could buy some nice designer boots Or more likely a fake designer bag. Oh but veritably on the U.S. market that is a drag. I don’t agree with the ways of fakes. But I like to eat lots at classic old bakes Or barbecue meets for that matter! Brazilian versions might make you fatter. Work it off by learning to dance. Get on Dancing With The Stars? Not a chance! Or instead of all of that, you can sit in your house. But if a fire comes, with water you will douse. Those wood fences are ideal but trouble. Especially if the fire bursts your bubble! Perhaps the answer is a fence not wood. Something different to put up in your neighborhood. I’ve heard of vinyl fences, they might be it. Now I’m tired of doing this rhyming bit. So take it or leave it, your life or this one. Whatever the case, right now I am done!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Tagging</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/tagging/"/> <updated>2007-04-10T13:45:40-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/tagging</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although not exactly new, something that I’ve recently added to my blog is tags. Hopefully you (the reader) will find them useful when looking through my site. These are specified by me each time I write a post, and I am trying to make them as high-level descriptive as possible. I also noticed that while updating the posts written previous to installing &lt;a href=&quot;http://ryanlee.org/software/wp/croissanga/&quot;&gt;Croissanga&lt;/a&gt; (which cross-posts snippets of my entries to xanga), they were getting added to xanga as new entries because they were not previously known to Croissanga. Oh well, maybe it’ll give people a chance to re-visit my old entries. I, for one, thought they were interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, on to more about the tagging. I’m using a plugin called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior&quot;&gt;Ultimate Tag Warrior&lt;/a&gt; (how awesome of a name is that??) to handle the tagging duties. For the user, I am displaying the tags in a “tag cloud” on the sidebar as well as with each post. The way that the tag cloud works is that it has a list of each tag available. For the tags that are least used, I have set it to show up as more gray and in smaller text. Proportionally as the tag is used more and more, the text is larger and more black. This, in my opinion complete surpasses the functionality of the previous “categories” because it gives a visual representation rather than simply a list of categories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On another note, I know that I’ve been talking a lot about the plugins that I have on my Wordpress installation, but don’t worry because I will soon write a post describing all of my plugins in an easier to read list. Of course, that would be more interesting to those that are actually interested in a little of what makes this blog. Or it might appeal to those on the Internet searching for a list of someone’s setup, though I know that there are countless such pages already existing…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On an even different note, I’ve gotten a little feedback with people saying that they don’t like the “Click to read the rest of this entry” where it cuts the entry off and forces you to the permalinked page. I wanted to explain it and give more people an opportunity to give some feedback.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;reasons-for-including-snippets-of-each-post-on-the-front-page-as-well-as-on-xanga&quot;&gt;Reasons for including snippets of each post on the front page as well as on Xanga&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It keeps the “Home” page &lt;strong&gt;shorter and cleaner&lt;/strong&gt; in my opinion. If I didn’t only post the snippets, then the front page would be ungainly in my opinion. To keep it short, I would only include 1 or (possibly) 2 posts. This would just lead to people clicking links to see older entries!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;forces people to my site&lt;/strong&gt; when they’re reading through Xanga. Why would I want to do this? Well I like to know who is reading my website (at least a hit or &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;) or that &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; is even reading my blog. After spending the time to write my entries and put up this blog, I think that I’m entitled to at least know when people are looking at it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the main reasons that I’m hearing that people don’t like to do this is because they either want to remain anonymous and just read it without having to ping my site itself as well as it takes too much trouble. In response to the first, you’ll just have to get over it. It’s not as if I’m the CIA and trying to track you or anything. You’re mainly just a number (okay a little more than that because of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statcounter.com&quot;&gt;Statcounter&lt;/a&gt;) but you don’t have to worry too much about pinging my site. And in response to the second reason, you’ll just have to stop being so lazy. Computers make your life easier already. How hard is it to click one link, and then hit the “back” button on your browser after you’re done? It’s not hard at all, that’s what it is.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Egregious</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/egregious/"/> <updated>2007-04-09T11:30:16-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/egregious</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[i-&lt;strong&gt;gree&lt;/strong&gt;-j_uh_ s, -jee-&lt;em&gt;uh&lt;/em&gt; s]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Extreme or monumental in some negative way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now some people will forget things on their vacation, but forgetting your credit card and money is an egregious mistake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think that this word is pretty useful in everyday language.

Now I think that Wordpress has been pretty great, but there was something about it that was making me a little bit irritated. Wordpress was working great when I first started, but then one day it seemingly reverted itself back to the Default theme as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427&quot;&gt;Kiki&lt;/a&gt; so astutely pointed out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/21/coffee-distaste/&quot;&gt;on this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever since I was simply temporarily fixing the problem by renaming the default theme to kubrick and actually making a copy of my real theme (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xsized.de/wordpress-theme-not-so-fresh/&quot;&gt;Not So Fresh&lt;/a&gt;) and naming it default. Thus if wordpress ever decided to revert again, it would have no effect on what people saw.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is obviously a dumb fix&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So last night I looked harder for the source of the bug. I happened upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/support/topic/80523#post-415311&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; and noted this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The theme is reset to the default if the current theme appears broken with broken meaning that index.php or style.css are missing. If files are being deleted then replaced by some sync process, that could explain the theme reversion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ryan (Lead Dev)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This indicated to me that it might not necessarily be something wrong with my theme (since mine is a “modern” theme that seems to conform to many of the Wordpress standards). I then realized that I had made a backup of my Wordpress installation some time ago and left it in the same publicly accessible directory. (Aside: that is not a smart thing to do. I should have put it into a private directory that nobody could access.) Anyways, I suspect (thought I didn’t look far enough) that what happened was that someone (likely a search bot) found my backup directory and accessed the contents. This would in turn cause the Wordpress installation to not be able to find the proper index.php and/or style.css required pages. And this would cause the Wordpress installation to mistakingly believe that there was an error in the theme (and it would thus revert itself back to the default theme with an update command to wp_options).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, I deleted the backup that I no longer needed anyways, and cleaned out all of the junk in the apache-served directory that was unnecessary. If you are trying to solve your own similar problem, it will likely have to do with some files in your public-facing directory that reference Wordpress but are not actually in a proper Wordpress installation. Clean up those index.php and style.css files!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, so far the theme is holding fast, and I hope that it continues to do so because it’s a pain in the butt looking through logs and forums posts to find out what’s going on! Also it’d be nice to have a very clean and bug-free installation so that I could move on to more interesting things like perhaps hosting someone else’s blog in the future…&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>I Want To 'Share This'!</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/i-want-to-share-this/"/> <updated>2007-04-08T19:37:06-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/i-want-to-share-this</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you use Wordpress, I recommend the very nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.lipidity.com/feature/wp-plugin-gregarious&quot;&gt;Gregarious&lt;/a&gt; plugin for social bookmarking. It has an excellent interface and the Share This button works very well. But I was having a bug with it because the popup wouldn’t display.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of my readers won’t care one iota about this entire post. But I don’t post what they want to read, I post whatever I want to post! And onward!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically I was experiencing the error where the Javascript popup would not show up for the Share This button, and I was actually getting redirected to another page. I saw that prototype.js needed to be added, but I was confused because I could see in the page source that it was being added. I also verified that wp_footer() was being called in my footer template, and I saw the akst Javascript code being appended at the bottom of the pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So after some debugging (I figured that it was something that I could find) I found that I wasn’t getting the popup because I had previously removed some of the social sites through the gregarious options (mainly because I wanted to limit the sites to those that I knew well). This caused the Javascript to result in an error (in my case: $(”akst_furl”) has no properties) because I had deleted furl from my list of social sites. This subsquently left the Javascript to error out which resulted in no popup window being displayed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To verify what I suspected, I temporarily reset my social sites and saw that I was able to get the Javascript popup to show (because all of the Javascript properties were properly set).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I can obviously go into the akst.js and comment out those that I don’t want and then de-activate them from the gregarious options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fix: Add checks in the Javascript before processing so that anything changed in the gregarious options will not affect the Javascript. I looked at the option_value for greg_social_sites, and perhaps the best way is to read that string in, process it, and then overwrite the Javascript to be output into akst.js? But that’s just an idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I posted feedback to the author &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.lipidity.com/feature/wp-plugin-gregarious#comment-4495&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I figured that I might as well post it also in case anyone is looking for it and happens to stumble upon my blog before the author’s (which I see as highly unlikely).&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Break The Fast...Twice</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/break-the-fast-twice/"/> <updated>2007-04-06T12:15:20-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/break-the-fast-twice</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now it’s generally understood that eating breakfast is a good thing for you. It gets you going in the morning by providing energy, and this in turn gets your body’s metabolism to change from its “sleep” mode to its “day” mode. And that’s good for you because the more energy you burn the more food you can consume. So you are essentially burning calories simply by being awake rather than having to work them off through exercise. Granted you’re not going to lose all of your excess weight, but it does help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I like to do is break my fast twice. I’d like to think that it gives me double the benefits, but I am probably completely wrong about that. That’d just be another case of justifying my actions. So I get up in the morning and mosey my way on downstairs. I eat a bowl of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kraftfoods.com/PostCereals/hbo.htm&quot;&gt;Honey Bunches of Oats&lt;/a&gt; with some fresh fruit (either bananas (cheap from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.costco.com&quot;&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;!) or frozen blueberries). That happens at around 8:15 AM every weekday. That’s pretty normal right? I’m breaking that fast from about 9 PM the previous night until 8:15 AM that day. That’s a hefty 11 hours and 15 minutes fast every single day!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing is…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also break the fast from 8:25 AM (after I finish the cereal) to approximately 11 AM. That’s a not-quite-as-hefty 2 hours and 45 minutes fast. But the thing is…I’m fasting twice &lt;strong&gt;five times a week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people laugh at me about that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay everyone that I tell that to laughs at me about that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adropofwater.net&quot;&gt;some people&lt;/a&gt; say that I eat first breakfast and second breakfast. And the aforementioned people, whoever they might be, also say that I’m like a hobbit. Because (truth be told) I also have second lunch in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally I must admit that I actually don’t eat as much as I was for awhile because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/15/separate-yourself/&quot;&gt;I have been setting aside time and closing out the world&lt;/a&gt; in order to work more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;NOTICE TO ANYONE IN THE ORANGE AREA NEAR THE 55-91 JUNCTION:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chick-fil-a.com/Home.asp&quot;&gt;Chick-Fil-A&lt;/a&gt; is having &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; breakfasts on Fridays for the next few weeks in order to spread the news about their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chick-fil-a.com/cfa.asp?template=map&amp;amp;transaction=locMap&amp;amp;recordId=1892&quot;&gt;new location&lt;/a&gt;!

And that’s niiiice.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>A (Possibly) New Idea For American Idol</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-possibly-new-idea-for-american-idol/"/> <updated>2007-04-04T21:51:07-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-possibly-new-idea-for-american-idol</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I’m not sure if it is indeed a new idea, but I recently have been thinking that I’d like the producers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americanidol.com/&quot;&gt;American Idol&lt;/a&gt; to consider a new idea. After watching the show tonight as well as thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/starvationforsanjaya&quot;&gt;extreme measures to vote certain contestants&lt;/a&gt;. My idea is they should implement a new system for their voting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They need to allow for the ability to eliminate the bad people, not &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt; vote for the best. The bad thing about the current system is that you get people like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americanidol.com/contestants/season6/sanjaya_malakar/&quot;&gt;Sanjaya Malakar&lt;/a&gt; who lots and lots of people want off, but can’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; do anything about it except starve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To allow for this, it would be so simple for the producers to modify. They would add another phone number for each contestant that would be to vote against a particular person. Then they could simply subtract the negative votes from the positive votes. I don’t see how this could possibly be a bad thing for the show. I still think that the best person will end up winning. And just like the current system, a very large group of people still have the ability to circumvent the system if they’re organized and thorough. It seems like a good idea to me. But a lot of things have seemed like a good idea to me so that’s nothing new.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However if they implemented it, I know that I’d be calling to vote off Sanjaya. And I don’t even call at all now.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Trying Out Some Advertisements</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/trying-out-some-advertisements/"/> <updated>2007-04-03T12:42:01-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/trying-out-some-advertisements</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now I don’t want to be a sneaky bugger (even though some might say that about me anyways), so I will tell you upfront that I’m trying out Google AdSense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally I have added a site search at the top that will allow you to not only search the web, but it will also allow you to search only my site! I think that’s a fairly useful feature if you were so inclined to wonder about what whether I’ve written about a certain topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now why would I add these features? Well I’ll also be honest with you about something else. I actually don’t hardly ever click on ads (even the nice text ads that aren’t obnoxious). But I also have realized that they’re not too bad to click on. It doesn’t hurt me to look at an advertisement site (especially when it actually &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; related to what I’m looking at). Anyways so if nothing ever comes of it, then that’s fine. But I figured that I should stop wondering if I could make enough money blogging, and I should just try it out. Google ads are generally pretty good about finding out about content and delivering meaningful ads. I can tentatively vouch for that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, I have also added a bunch of support buttons to my site. I think that although they generally detract from the main purpose of the site (which is to post content from my mind), they warrant their place. Each of these components are either important to the support of this blog or to my personal usage. They are simply a sign of things that I approve of. These are totally unrelated to the advertisements that I’m trying out, and all are freely available for you to use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feedback on these topics as well as on any other topic on this site is always welcome.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Precocious</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/precocious/"/> <updated>2007-04-02T11:30:37-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/precocious</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[pri-&lt;strong&gt;koh&lt;/strong&gt;-sh_uh_ s]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unusually advanced or mature&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the rest of the class was struggling with their work, the precocious child had finished already and was causing a ruckus because he was bored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is definitely one of those words that is very descriptive of what you’re trying to say.

Of course people nowadays want there to be no judgments whatsoever. And let’s be honest, that doesn’t really make any sense at all. It makes about as much sense as getting rid of the court system, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well I saw something today, and it is a case that definitely makes me think about some judgment passing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now far be it from me to know if someone actually understands what it means to be a Christian. But I have to wonder about it when I see a sign on the street that proclaims that they should come to church in order to win a car. They direct you to their website where they have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ineedarevolution.com/easter/&quot;&gt;a page dedicated to their contest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To me, that seems outlandish where they feel that they have a need to offer people physical prizes in order to attract them to come to their church. Some out there will say that it’s a good thing to get people into church no matter how they got there. But is that really the right attitude?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seems ridiculous to me, and I hope that this is not a growing trend.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>The Right Leader</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-right-leader/"/> <updated>2007-03-31T17:40:44-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/the-right-leader</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0325710/&quot;&gt;The Last Samurai&lt;/a&gt; again, I realized some interesting things. Although Tom Cruise is fairly crazy as of late, this was definitely a good movie. In this viewing anyways, I thought that it was insightful to see a leader who was willing to join in on the fight. Contrast this with the leadership style of being perfectly willing to direct form the rear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that final scene where &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsumoto&quot;&gt;Katsumoto&lt;/a&gt; (loosely based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigo_Takamori&quot;&gt;Saigo Takamori&lt;/a&gt;) and Nathan Algren (played by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise&quot;&gt;Tom Cruise&lt;/a&gt;) lead the final charge against the Imperial Army, you see the contrasting styles where Katsumoto and Algren ride their horses through the enemy while Omura (played by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masato_Harada&quot;&gt;Masato Harada&lt;/a&gt;) stands on the hill helplessly trying to yell out orders for the gunmen to shoot their weapons. If not for the superior (albeit seemingly cheating) technology that the Imperial Army had, all of the honor rode with the samurai.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life has its share of similar incidents. There are those people who are willing to get down and dirty versus those who love to direct others. It’s the basic difference in thinking between those that want something done and those that will just go do it. Now this is probably a slightly unfair description of the situation because I think that I tend to be of the latter variety most of the time. And obviously &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/&quot;&gt;I must think that I am right&lt;/a&gt; about it. But objectively, those of the other mindset will think that people like me rush into things too quickly and act too impulsively sometimes. This is all true, but I digress. (Read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/&quot;&gt;this entry&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about what I think)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now what does this mean?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s definitely an often heard phrase, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead by example, not by dictation. Try it and you will find a spirit of self-reliance that you didn’t think possible. And that is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On another note: after a nice reprieve from the world as I know it, I’m back rested and with a little tan. :)&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Tenable</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/tenable/"/> <updated>2007-03-26T11:30:10-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/tenable</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;ten&lt;/strong&gt;-uh-buh l]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be capable of being held or defended&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;That bunker over there is on higher ground, has a good vantage point of the attackers, and is thus definitely tenable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;This word can be used both as meaning to hold an actual place, but more commonly in our day and age it can be used to describe a side of an argument.

You’re taking it easy for about 5 minutes as you release your body’s waste. Then you look over. There’s another stall next to you. You look down. Lo and behold! What do you see? A piece of dental floss! “Well that’s strange,” you think. What could dental floss possibly be doing in the bathroom. Now there are a few possibilities:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone was flossing while they were sitting on the toilet. After finished with it, they just dropped it on the ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somehow there was some dental floss in some guy’s pocket and it came out as he was dropping them to sit on the toilet. He had gone outside to take a “floss break”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were in his underwear because he keeps some dental floss there “just in case” (what that case is where he needs dental floss in his underwear is beyond the scope of this entry)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;He ate some dental floss and it had come out the other end. How did it get on the floor without stains? Once again, beyond the scope of this entry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dental floss is raining from the bathroom ceiling&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Hello Statistics, How Are You?</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/hello-statistics-how-are-you/"/> <updated>2007-03-21T16:05:37-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/hello-statistics-how-are-you</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedburner.com&quot;&gt;feedburner&lt;/a&gt; for stats on my website lately. It’s just a little bit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript&quot;&gt;Javascript&lt;/a&gt; added to the templates. Pretty simple. Except it wasn’t working today! It kept showing 0 visitors when I know for SURE that there were visitors (like me!). What’s going on??&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427&quot;&gt;Kiki&lt;/a&gt; noticed that my theme had changed to the default earlier this morning. I’m not sure what was going on, but it might perhaps be related to that? Anyways the change caused me to look for something else out there that could help me out. I’ve used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitemeter.com&quot;&gt;site meter&lt;/a&gt; before but I don’t like how there’s a little icon when you add the code to your page (although now that I think about it, I realize that I know a lot more about HTML and Javascript now compared to when I added that code to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanga.com/keleka&quot;&gt;my xanga&lt;/a&gt; so I could easily just remove the image and retain the functionality. But that’s a moot point now).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I found &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.statcounter.com&quot;&gt;statcounter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which seems to work very well. There’s more information gathered and available than at sitemeter and it’s more real-time than feedburner was. So I’m pretty happy with it thus far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make it even better because there’s apparently &lt;a href=&quot;http://citizenk.wordpress.com/wp-plugins/statcounter-for-wordpress/&quot;&gt;a sitecounter for wordpress plugin&lt;/a&gt;! That’s super! (Note: I had to download &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.almaren.ch/view.php?file=/code/wordpress/wp-plugins/statcounter/statcounter.php&quot;&gt;the php page&lt;/a&gt; itself because the zip file was linked incorrectly, but the installation was the same and went smoothly)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I just thought you’d like to know that you’re being tracked a little bit. Not as if you didn’t expect it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thought that the “blog” category needed another entry so that the “Rant” category could take a well-deserved break. :D&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Coffee Distaste</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/coffee-distaste/"/> <updated>2007-03-21T12:06:02-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/coffee-distaste</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I talked to a co-worker a little bit yesterday as he was getting some coffee at the same time as I was heating up lunch in the microwave. I asked him how much coffee he drinks a day. I was amazed and kind of sickened when he said that he drinks 5-10 cups a day (where he would want to do 10 if it’s possible to get away from his desk).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay so maybe I wasn’t that sickened, but when he told me that at another job where he sat near the coffee pot (which was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew&quot;&gt;drip style&lt;/a&gt; coffee maker) and drank 3 pots a day I was definitely grossed out! What in the world?! I, of course, asked him if he felt effects from it, and he claimed that he did not. But I don’t know if I believe him because that is just ridiculous. Plus he then proceeded to talk about how if he drinks coffee with too much sugar he’ll crash from the sugar and get very short-tempered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wow, extremes like that usually seem pretty outlandish to other people, don’t they? They do to me anyways.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Even Worse</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/even-worse/"/> <updated>2007-03-20T12:26:51-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/even-worse</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know, there are a lot of things that are “bad” in this world. Obviously sin is a pretty general answer. But without even having to speak on the more heinous things such as actions warranting fines and felonies, we actually see and encounter many things everyday which are not very good at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever met someone who simply cares about nothing? What a waste of a life! To simply meander through life without truly being passionate or caring is such a tragedy. To be scared to love simply because one has been hurt, to be scared to take sides simply because one is afraid to be wrong, to be scared of life simply to preserve it. Well those people make me sad. Is there something worse?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well I’m not sure if I would say that it’s “worse,” but it’s definitely pretty high on my list of “bad things.” Now some might disagree and that’s their prerogative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think that having an opinion (especially a strong one) without any backing is pretty horrendous.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve met people that will do this sometimes, but rarely have I truly experienced the full power of this shortcoming. Nonetheless, a glimpse of it is all I need to see that I have a distaste for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure it’s horrible to not feel anything at all. But it seems to me that it’s equally, if not more so, horrible to be swayed this way and that to the extremes without any concrete evidence to back it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What prompted me to this? Well I’ll be honest and say that sometimes I read other people’s blogs. I also enjoy reading xangas (even though my own is now just an extension of this blog). I have a whole list of “subscriptions” to people that I’ve met over the years. Some of them are friends that I still talk to, while others are not quite as near and dear to my heart anymore. While reading an entry from one of these long-ago acquaintances about &lt;a href=&quot;http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/&quot;&gt;300&lt;/a&gt;, I saw that they made a comment about how stupid it was to have all of these guys dressed how they were with such obscene amounts of computer assistance in making their bodies perfect. Now, being someone who is into “knowing how things work,” I don’t even like how people can assume things about what computers can and cannot do without actually knowing about it (but that’s a topic for another entry). Back to the example. So the reason that reading this entry made me want to write this entry is because I &lt;strong&gt;also&lt;/strong&gt; read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=35&quot;&gt;the extensive workouts&lt;/a&gt; that the actors, stunt doubles, and crew went through before the movie for four months to get the physique that they showed off in the movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now what’s the big deal you ask? Well it’s a big deal because it speaks of something deeper! Just like hearing someone who is usually very “good” but will blurt out an expletive in a moment of anger speaks of deeper issues about just how “good” they really are, so also does this strong opinion about the faultiness of the whole production speak of some interesting traits in the opinion-holder. I suggest people do a little research on their own before they speak of things which they have no idea about. Else you will be thought foolish and ignorant by others. And nobody wants to be a fool. And you especially don’t want to be ignorant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is why I used to get irritated at people on &lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org&quot;&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt; as well as why I can get irritated listening to IT people sometimes.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Nefarious</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/nefarious/"/> <updated>2007-03-19T11:30:41-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/nefarious</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[ni-&lt;strong&gt;fair&lt;/strong&gt;-ee-uh s]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be extremely wicked or evil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nefarious plan to set him up to take the fall for the murder has been going on for ages!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like this word because you can use it for evil!

I am. Whether seeing little kids bending and contorting in Chinatown or watching Kobe Bryant do his thing, I try to be amazed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can I first of all just say that Kobe Bryant is a pretty ridiculous basketball player? For those that don’t follow the National Basketball Association, Kobe scored 65 points on Friday night and 50 points yesterday. So that means in 2 games, Kobe has scored 115 points at the highest professional basketball level. I question whether I’ve scored that many points in games in my entire life combined! Now, if you add in all of the buckets for shooting around, I’m golden. But can you believe this guy? I can’t. Was it a good idea to build the Lakers around him rather than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nba.com/playerfile/shaquille_oneal/&quot;&gt;Mr. O’Neal&lt;/a&gt; ? Well that kind of remains to be seen. But that doesn’t detract from the fact that it’s amazing to watch him make turnaround 3-pointers while double-teamed as the shot clock is winding down and the game is on the line. I had to construct a run-on sentence just to describe the whole scenario!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A little girl bending over backwards as only those in the circus can do? Pretty amazing. I don’t understand, sometimes, how others can have a body capable of such strange things. I remember watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tv.com/guinness-world-records-primetime/show/10187/summary.html&quot;&gt;Guinness World Records&lt;/a&gt; and thinking that it was so amazing that there could be people out there that could fit into a tiny box (or whatever the amazing feat of the evening was).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And after seeing these amazing things over the weekend, I think:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wonder what my most amazing feat will ever be. I wonder if it has already happened. Now that’s a sad thought.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>In Your Own World</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/in-your-own-world/"/> <updated>2007-03-16T12:53:08-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/in-your-own-world</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many people in your life. Well, I hope that there are some anyways, otherwise you need to stop reading blogs and go make some friends. Anyways, I have a sinking suspicion that what is true for me is true for most people out there. I’d like to think that I’m not completely abnormal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know that I act differently around different people. Now you must understand, I actually don’t really like it when people are like this. Am I a hypocrite?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d like to think not, but I’ll leave that issue for another time because I’m sure that I am. No, the issue that I’m talking about is not necessarily hypocrisy so much as it is human nature. There might very well be nobody out there that will act completely the same in front of other people as they would when they’re by themselves. They won’t fart as much, they won’t scratch themselves in the same places, or whatever it may be. Additionally, there aren’t too many people that will completely act the same. They might not be as at ease so they won’t talk as much when they’re around you. I know that this is true for me when I’m around people whom I don’t really know. But this all seems fairly natural.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thing is, I think that it’s hilarious when you get a sneak peak into someone’s life à la &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0120382/&quot;&gt;The Truman Show&lt;/a&gt;. Do you ever think what your life would look like if there were cameras everywhere and watching you at every moment? That would be such a trip. Makes you re-think how you picked your nose the other day, doesn’t it? Do we resort, then, to stalker tactics? No, we definitely do not. That’s against the law, and I won’t be your friend if you start doing that. Plus, we don’t really need to. People help us out as it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s amusing, but I’ve noticed that Computer Science people in particular are easy to spot lost in their own world. Perhaps it’s because they’re deep thinking about imaginary objects in their object-oriented programming or trying to lay out in their mind their current algorithm. Whatever the case, I’ve seen a few people (at least) who will do something gross. I remember a prime example in one of my classes at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucsd.edu&quot;&gt;UCSD&lt;/a&gt; where a guy would sit in class, play with his ear, and then smell it. Smell it! Now that looks disgusting, but I don’t even know if the guy knew that he was doing this! He was also at the same time seemingly intent on listening to the professor. I never knew this guy, so I actually don’t know if he was listening, but class after class, he’d do the same gross thing with his ear and smelling his fingers. I’d imagine that there was a strong smell too, otherwise why would he smell it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anther thing that I’ve noticed is that the same thing happens with people in their cars. Apparently because they’re in a (fairly) small, enclosed space, they think that they’re alone. And I must admit that it is very easy to feel that way. Except, of course, there are windows all around you. So people can see whatever you’re doing, whether that be gross, weird, or funny. I like seeing people do these things. It definitely makes me laugh at them. I especially like seeing people dance. I hope that I also make people as amused if they see me. :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what can we draw from these things? 1) We do not fart as much in front of other people as we do by ourselves. 2) I want to have a real Truman Show for someone, any volunteers? 3) Don’t do something in your car that you don’t mind other people seeing. 4) There are a few strange Computer Science out there. Somewhere. Not here. :D&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Separate Yourself</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/separate-yourself/"/> <updated>2007-03-15T12:16:42-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/separate-yourself</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A hint for those who are working and find themselves easily distracted. Well I guess a hint for all of us. It’s hard to focus on a single task (such as your current work project) in this multi-tasking day and age. Something that’s helped me to differentiate between the different tasks at hand has been the use of “virtual desktops”. Most people out there (especially if you’re reading this blog) have an idea of what the desktop is. Basically it’s a folder that contains some items and is what you are looking at when there are no windows open. Now most people are very comfortable with the idea of having one of these.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I propose that you start to think about how useful it would be to have &lt;strong&gt;multiple&lt;/strong&gt; desktops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Why would this be useful?” you might ask. Well in the aforementioned problem, we did not have the self-control to stop from occasionally glancing at the news or email and effectively kill our workflow. Whether that means losing your place in your spreadsheet, or forgetting what the current for loop does, or whatever it may be, it’s a hindrance to being all that you can be in the workplace. And that’s not good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if you place your project on one “desktop” and your other stuff on another “desktop,” you will be able to go to your project and not be as easily distracted! Additionally, something that I have tried and will try to continue to do more of is to “box” my time. That is, I will actually write down times that I am going to be doing this (i.e. an hour for this project). And for that hour, I will try as best as I can to shut out everything else and focus. I will try to drown out the noise with &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/S7ktz5&quot;&gt;some cheap ear buds&lt;/a&gt; or even put in some ear plugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now mind you, this isn’t a solution for your faults. If you still don’t have the self-control to not look at other things, then that’s your problem. And you’ll need other help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well this idea is definitely on Linux, and you can easily find references to it for both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnome.org/&quot;&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt; (which I do enjoy using) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://kde.org/&quot;&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; (which is nice in a different way). But if you are a fan of something other than these desktop environments (as I suspect that many of my readers are), then you might want to continue reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;, I recently installed &lt;a href=&quot;http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;VirtuWin&lt;/a&gt; which has worked out pretty nicely. It’s fairly full-featured, and I can get it pretty much how I want it. Microsoft released their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx&quot;&gt;XP Power Toys&lt;/a&gt; awhile back that has an application called “Virtual Desktop Manager” that does a similar thing. Unfortunately I thought that it wasn’t very good the one time that I tried it out. So I avoided it on this most recent search.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the &lt;strong&gt;Mac&lt;/strong&gt;, you have the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://virtuedesktops.info/index.php/downloads/&quot;&gt;VirtueDesktops&lt;/a&gt; which I have used and approve of. Unfortunately the developer for the project has decided to call it quits because the next upcoming release of Mac OS X (dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/&quot;&gt;“Leopard”&lt;/a&gt;) includes a feature that is similar enough to VirtueDesktops to discourage a third-party from developing. This feature might be good, it might not be. But you can try out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/spaces.html&quot;&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt; when Leopard is released sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, there are many things out there that will accomplish this task for you whatever your computing platform. Remember that the important issue is to become more efficient with your time and minimize interruptions to your workflow. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Plague Of The Video Review</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/plague-of-the-video-review/"/> <updated>2007-03-14T15:08:43-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/plague-of-the-video-review</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Something that goes along with what I touched upon in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/09/your-own-b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; entry is that people are trying to be more and more politically correct. Now granted, I am all for finding out the truth and discovering what is going on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However when you have the National Basketball Association going back and reviewing old tapes and determining that a foul should have been called on Kobe Bryant, you are not doing right by the spirit of the game. I read an article similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=ApY4gUOXWX0Giri7wiHAYoi8vLYF?slug=ap-nba-lakers-jackson&amp;amp;prov=ap&amp;amp;type=lgns&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, and I was slightly outraged at the ridiculousness of it all. I’m a Los Angeles Laker fan, for better or worse. And I think that Kobe Bryant is pretty amazing as a basketball player. But this is not about that. This is about how people are always trying to be exactly right, holding to the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law. What is that doing in an entry about sports you ask? Well people have been applying that idea more and more to sports. There have been the sudden burst of video replays in college football that have led to some good things (like fixed calls) and some bad things (like long games and still getting the call wrong). And then there are the extreme cases of outrage where officials such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nba.com/nba101/stu_jackson.html&quot;&gt;Stu Jackson&lt;/a&gt; will re-visit a game simply to find faults. Where there might have been a regular foul called, they will turn into a suspension. Now, that just seems like idiocy to me. Let the officials at the game decide what the call should be. If you’re so willing to make a call after the fact, then how will you be able to overturn a call after the fact?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s irritating to think of the things that are starting to go on the world. It might seem like I’m getting worked up over a stupid game, but it has ramifications in all of the world. Why? Because it’s not limited to a game, it’s the mindset that people are starting to have more and more. And that is even more troubling than the problems with video review in sports.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Humorous Gadgets</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/humorous-gadgets/"/> <updated>2007-03-14T11:28:16-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/humorous-gadgets</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/top-10-funniest-gadgets&quot;&gt;this entry&lt;/a&gt; a little while ago, I thought it would be appropriate to list some of my favorites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/420716497_3166567d7c_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ipodtp_2&quot; /&gt; Starting off with a slightly horrendous take on this iPod-centric marketing is this piece of work. To imagine anyone in their right mind buying this is absurd. To think, you couldn’t live without your iPod for the 5-10 minutes (okay 1 minute if you’re &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanga.com/fonghwang&quot;&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt; haha) that you’re sitting on the toilet. Take the time to enjoy your time off from your life. Relax and let it all out. And don’t touch your iPod before washing or else people will post entries like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/07/a-scary-thought/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; about you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/420716505_f45089498b_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;harder teeth&quot; /&gt; See I personally think that something like this is a good idea. I mean our teeth are used in order to break down food that we eat, right? Well these bad boys will do just that. I have a couple of issues with it, however. Firstly, they need to get a model who is not about to fall asleep as she’s wearing the teeth. Secondly, they need to remedy how extremely ugly you’ll look when you’re wearing them. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_%28James_Bond%29&quot;&gt;Jaws&lt;/a&gt;, anyone?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/420716495_b0438c971d_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;drivemoticon&quot; /&gt; Here is another gadget that actually seems useful. Unfortunately everyone will look at you like a fool if you so happen to actually use one. Everyone is better off when other drivers are considerate and expressive of how they actually feel. Unfortunately technology cannot make advances in all areas. It has to take a back seat some of the time (pun intended :P).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/128/420716507_6a407be63b_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fresh air machine&quot; /&gt; Oh man, this is awesome. Now I’m all for having cleaner air to breathe, but there are a few issues that I have with this. First off, what kind of mad person is willing to either carry that thing around or be anchored to one spot for a long time? And more importantly, how in the world does a single plant produce that much oxygen for you to breath constantly? I suppose it might make a tiny bit of sense if you just left it to accumulate fresh air and then you took a whiff every now and again. But even that’s a stretch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/421254893_c86d19fdb2_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Triumph Japan 2&quot; /&gt; Haha only the Japanese would come up with such a ridiculous invention. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.triumphjapan.com/release/unique/2006110700166.html&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is why I know it’s the Japanese who get credit for this one.) There’s no way underwear should be used for anything other than being worn as such. Come on now, that’s just gross.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/420716502_8fafc806f5_o.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;360 camera&quot; /&gt; One of my favorite! I love the picture. I think that I might have seriously chuckled aloud. And I was by myself. To imagine this being used is actually not all too outrageous because of the high cost of doing this with a device designed for this express purpose. I just would really really like to see someone doing this. I also enjoy how they show you how to truly experience the 360 degree picture that you’ve taken. :-p&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And to think, I always wanted to invent something cool. Why bother when I can live vicariously through all of these other inventors with the fortitude to do something about it? :grin:&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Favicon(s)!</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/favicons/"/> <updated>2007-03-13T14:43:46-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/favicons</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just in time for the unveiling of a favicon for this site: A post about favicons! :D&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay so just what is a “favicon”? Well it is basically that small icon that you see next to the url when you go to a site. There are different icons for different sites as I’m sure most of you have noticed. This is basically a special “ico” file that is a tiny picture format.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s very easy to create one. At the very simplest you can just go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/&quot;&gt;a pretty good online favicon generator&lt;/a&gt; and submit a picture to convert. They’ll allow you to download the resulting file. Then to use this file with your site, you have to upload or somehow place the file on your server, and add this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot; href=&quot;http://example.com/favicon.ico&quot; type=&quot;image/x-icon&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/link&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt; to the page that your users will see (typically something like index.html) in between “&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;” and “&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;”. Then you would replace the “http://example.com/favicon.ico” with the corresponding path to get to your file. And that’s it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course you could do things like edit it in the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://gimp.org/&quot;&gt;gimp&lt;/a&gt; and add some transparency, etc before you convert it. And you can obviously use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/&quot;&gt;adobe’s expensive product&lt;/a&gt; to do this (although if you already ponied up for this you better know how to make favicons :P).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s it, you have a nice little personal touch for your website!

I &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; that it was a woman based on the hair that she had, but who knows? I thought that maybe she was the wife of a marine because there was a large sticker on the window of the marines. So I was thinking that she likely would be someone who simply was born and raised on California. However, I wondered about who truly COULD drive a car with that license plate frame. Would it be the Mexicans (well Spaniards then I suppose)? Would it be the native Americans (commonly known as the Indians because of one Christopher Columbus? Can anyone who is born and raised in California proudly bear the frame on their automobile?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m definitely not a fan of someone who proclaims to be something they’re not (imagine someone who graduates from one school driving around with an alumni frame from another school).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interesting thought don’t you think? I’ve never seen that license plate frame, and I’m sure that most people wouldn’t think much more of it than the fact that they are a proud Californian. But there seems to be something to it, don’t you think? The dislike of people who proclaim to be something that they’re not. The truth that you find when you dig a little bit deeper. Or you find the seeming distaste that people have for thinking further than what their next meal would be. What a tragic life.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Aplomb</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/aplomb/"/> <updated>2007-03-12T11:30:12-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/aplomb</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[uh-&lt;strong&gt;plom&lt;/strong&gt;, uh-&lt;strong&gt;pluhm&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Poise, composure, or self-assurance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having to process 1,000 cases in 2 hours was daunting to say the least, but she handled it with aplomb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;This word is a much more interesting word to use than others, and it seems to be somewhat colloquial in its rather specific uses. Nonetheless it is an interesting word whose simple structure does not betray its true meaning to the uninitiated (translation: you probably can’t figure out what it means if you don’t already know what it means). It’s usually used when talking about facing difficult circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Disaster</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/disaster/"/> <updated>2007-03-11T17:42:57-07:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/disaster</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are disasters all over the world, but somehow when there’s one that’s closer to home, it changes your perspective. So apparently the fire that has been going on today in Anaheim Hills is actually not all too far away from home. In fact, El Modena High School is one of the shelters, and that school is in my distract. As a matter of fact it’s probably only 5-10 minutes away!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It makes you think about how things are. Our lives are based on so much that is simply temporary. When something changes and we are left with whatever we are left with, then we are left with the choice to decide what is truly important in our life. What will we choose? Some of us will choose to pursue a life of pleasure (whether that means obtain “things” or satisfying oneself somehow). Some of us will decide that life isn’t worth it anymore. Some of us will continue on doing what we think that we are supposed to be doing just as we have been doing all of our lives (not considering the reason or logic to why we do it all). Some of us will attempt to live for “something greater” (whatever that may entail). No matter what, it is intriguing to think about the fact that we are not the same once we are under duress. As it is, a fairly insignificant percentage of people in the United States are actually under hardships such as these that make them re-evaluate their lives. Have you ever thought about it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Changes are not usually easy. Some are even more difficult. I’d rather not waste my life, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Your Own B-U-S-I-N-E-S-S</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/your-own-b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s/"/> <updated>2007-03-09T16:57:03-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/your-own-b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After reading a Los Angeles Times article similar in content to &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2007/03/08/News/Facebook.Group.Lands.Usc.Football.Player.In.Hot.Water-2764591.shtml?reffeature=recentlycommentedstoriestab&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article, I knew that I just had to make some comments about it. In this politically correct country where everyone has their say and is entitled to their rights, there are many people who think that it’s all very outlandish and ridiculous. And not in the funny or amusing way. I am one of those people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Granted, I don’t think that creating a facebook about the “Arian [sic] nation” is necessarily something great. But it’s obviously a joke and to make such a big deal about it is absurd. They were printed in the LA Times, for crying out loud! Ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest with you. I can’t stand people that blow things out of proportion like that. They get hung up on the smallest things, but they have no idea that they are missing the big picture. How did this politically correct trend begin? Was it women’s suffrage, or black rights, or what? I have no idea because I’m no history buff or even well-versed in politics, but all I know is that it’s irritatingly everywhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I propose that these people just quit acting like their feelings were hurt and get a sense of humor. I’ve read that one (of two) of the worst things to hear is that you are humorless and cannot take a joke. Well that is what I’m saying to this Stefanie Gopaul. Live a little and quit living your life by riding off the lives of those around you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Great, another rant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt; Haha I can’t believe that I messed up the HTML so badly that the link wasn’t showing! People must think that I sounded crazy talking about an article that they couldn’t even read. How lame of me.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>American Idol</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/american-idol/"/> <updated>2007-03-09T11:26:03-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/american-idol</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So there are many people out there who watch this show. I would just like to say that I am both disappointed and satisfied with it this week. I actually don’t like watching the results show because I think that it’s a bit of a waste of time to convey the results in an hour long (or whatever length it is) show. They use music and dramatic lighting to manufacture something out of nothing, and it is thoroughly annoying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thought that Jared was good. He sounded like Marvin Gaye! I thought that Sanjaya kid should definitely have been voted off. He annoys me. I think it’d be cool if they had 2 numbers for each contestant, one for voting “for” and one for voting “against”. They could take the result of that and use it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time I’m glad that Antonella got voted off even though she might have had some questionable photos posted online (which made her a huge topic of search on the Internet). It proves that there is some decency to the singing aspect of the show (because she was frankly not that great).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I kind of wonder what happens with these people when they return back from American Idol. Do they just become another “one of us” who has had their 15 minutes of fame? Or do any of them actually get to do something related to singing? I’m thinking that some of these people will revel in their temporary spotlight and always bring it up as they’re becoming a lounge singer or something. And then there will be (there have to be) some that still aspire for more and end up “making it” in some other way (be it a band or a contract or whatever).&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>A Scary Thought</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-scary-thought/"/> <updated>2007-03-07T13:32:05-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/a-scary-thought</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s no doubt that the people that i meet in life can somehow scale to the world at large in some way. That’s a scary thought when I realize that the man who goes into the bathroom stall next to me didn’t use a toilet seat cover. Why is that scary? It’s scary because that means that man also very likely will not be that concerned about washing his hands thoroughly (if at all). So why do I care if this guy (who I have no idea who he is) has dirty nasty hands? Well because he is representative of lots and lots of people! There are scores of people walking around out there that similarly don’t care about keeping their butts from being disgustingly touched by countless other butts. There are scores of people who similarly will not care about how clean their hands are. And odds are, some of those people’s hands will affect me. Be it the fact that they’re preparing my food or that they’re going to shake my hand, they will affect me. So you see, it affects us all. There are so very many things that we do that are not just our business. Drinking and driving, sneezing, not turning on our car lights at dusk, AND SO ON AND SO ON!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amazing.

Have you noticed the type of people who are willing to make comments or offer up their (often critical) opinion of something without actually trying to do something about it? I have come to notice that there are quite a fair amount of these type of people around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the workplace they manifest themselves as the people who can’t help you accomplish something “because it’s not what they do”. Essentially they are perfectly content to let you struggle to do something that you have are new to when they have in fact been working there for years. They are perfectly comfortable letting you sweat and possibly make mistakes. Despite all of this, they will be the first ones to come to you if there is a problem. Accusing, questioning, belittling, it’s laudable, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a friend, they will be the person that can’t for the life of them ever decide on where to go or what to eat. They will be indecisive about it all. However, they will be the first and most vocal critic when something doesn’t turn out well. Even if things didn’t turn out well, they will suddenly realize that something else would have been a better choice for &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; reason. They will talk behind your back, they will complain to your face, they will whine, and they will generally not be a whole lot of fun to be around. More of a “friend” than a friend, I’d venture to say. And maybe not even that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the open source community (and in other areas as well) they are the ones that will look at a product and immediately find the flaws. Granted the flaws should be found, but they at the same time do nothing but complain about the bugs that exist. They don’t try to help out in some way, and they don’t ever stop bringing up points that are already known. They will harp on the same issue as if that were the main point, even when it is not. They are generally ungrateful and quitters who wouldn’t know how to even start to formulate the product that they feel is insufficient. They are frankly useless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are just examples. There are countless other examples out there that I’ve experienced or seen, but for whom I would rather not have to rack my brain to remember.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are so many instances of this type of person out there that one has to wonder how in the world they can get along. How can they have any type of relationship with anyone when they have such an unbalanced approach to things? How high can they really aspire when they don’t care to do anything for themselves?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just don’t really understand these types of people.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Facetious</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/facetious/"/> <updated>2007-03-05T10:30:10-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/facetious</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[fuh-&lt;strong&gt;see&lt;/strong&gt;-shuhs]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not to be taken seriously or literally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re right, he did say that his room was as big as an elephant. However, you really need to lighten up because he was being facetious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;This word is amusingly difficult for some people to say (namely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanga.com/godschild1427&quot;&gt;Kiki Honda&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s a word that you could use quite often. Essentially it is an equivalent of saying “just kidding” after you say something that was not meant to be taken seriously. However, one is usually intentionally facetious whereas “just kidding” has been known to just be appended after any type of statement. Facetious is only a word to describe what you are probably already doing. So now you know what to call it (hopefully anyways)!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Are YOU Smarter Than A 5th Grader?</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/are-you-smarter-than-a-5th-grader/"/> <updated>2007-03-01T14:38:22-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/are-you-smarter-than-a-5th-grader</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that many people out there have watched this show (if its claim that it had the highest premiere in the last 8 years is correct). Fox put it in that key spot right after one of their big hits (American Idol) so people who tune in for that are very apt to just leave their tv on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the one hand I think that it’s a pretty lame show because it is almost entirely like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.millionairetv.com/&quot;&gt;this show&lt;/a&gt; even with the “lifelines” idea. On the other hand, I think that the shower can be interesting at times because we all (as adults) want to be “smarter” than a 5th grader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The show plays on pride as well as on the fact that there are a lot of things that we are very likely to forget in our lives. Even as someone who has recently finished schooling, I am still over 10 years removed from the 5th grade. That makes it hard to remember the purely knowledge-based answers such as when Columbus Day occurs or who the first president to be impeached was. However, there is just no excusing things that utilize simple principles such as finding the height of a triangle for a given area and base length.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which begs the question, are the majority of us really “smarter” than a 5th grader? We have more life experience (obviously). But I would tend to think that there are a lot of pretty dumb people out there who couldn’t reason as well as some 5th graders. Interesting and sad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I surely hope that I’m smarter than a 5th grader, but I’m not going to pound my head against the wall if I don’t know everything that they know. They probably won’t know it in 10 years either. I’m sure not going to sell myself out by taking $5,000 to say that on national television, though. I’m saving my 15 minutes for something more interesting, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Added 03/01/07 11:50 PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay and what is up with these kids? What 10-year old has that much confidence to talk to adults like that?? I know that I sure didn’t. I am finding that they frankly get on my nerves. Anyways, because of these thoughts I also had to add this entry to the “Rant” category. I sure do love to use that category.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Professional Integrity</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/professional-integrity/"/> <updated>2007-02-28T14:34:26-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/professional-integrity</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The truth about the cheaters is that they will get theirs. And everyone around them will be glad to see it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yesterday I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html&quot;&gt;a blog entry&lt;/a&gt; that got me to thinking. In summary, that blog entry was about programmers who cannot program to save their life. They go to interview for a position, but they can’t even write a simple program from scratch. Now having gone through a Computer Science program recently, I can verify that this is something that is likely true. However, I’m not sure if only 0.5% of the “programmers” out there could write the simple program. Nevertheless it’s true that it I’m outraged at the fact that there are many out there who are not all that they claim to be. Specifically, someone who has graduated from the same university as me with the same degree is no different on paper. However I know for a fact that there are many out there who could not program without a book or resources readily at hand. It’s unfortunate that we live in a world such as this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Truth be told, this affects many things besides the programming world. Anyone who has ever encountered a cheater has essentially stumbled upon the same idea. Those who are out to claim that they are something without actually doing something to back it up are far worse than those who claim to have no knowledge. I don’t know if embellishing a resume or trying to save face are necessarily things which will condemn you, but I know that a person who does those things has some character issues that are deep and rooted. And I don’t want to be that person’s friend. Maybe that’s motivation, maybe it’s not. Likely it’s not. Whatever the case, I don’t like you because your lack of integrity affects us all. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.knx1070.com/pages/3323.php?contentType=4&amp;amp;contentId=94560&quot;&gt; Dave Williams&lt;/a&gt; sure thought so this morning, and I agree.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Pragmatic</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/pragmatic/"/> <updated>2007-02-26T10:30:56-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/pragmatic</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[prag-&lt;strong&gt;mat&lt;/strong&gt;-ik]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be of or pertaining to having a practical point of view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pragmatic woman couldn’t be won over with flowers or romantic gestures, she always just saw them as a waste of money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;This word is really easy to remember because it SOUNDS like “practical”.

But it made me realize that even though college was fun, I do not long for the things in the past. Unfortunately, there are many out there that do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Truth be told, I have found that it is rather interesting when you encounter people who constantly have a desire for what has happened before. There are the older people who long for “the good old days”, and there are friends who seem to have only had a couple of note-worthy experiences in their entire life that they enjoy re-hashing over and over again. There are those that tell the same jokes repeatedly thinking that the humor of the joke continues to remain constant, and there are those who restrict themselves based on what’s happened in the past. Frankly I find that none of those approaches make much sense. What is life if we are unable to change ourselves and have new experiences? How can we have great experiences if we are stuck in the pat re-living the old antiquated ones? The simple answer is that we can’t. (Note: I just had to add the category &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/category/rant/&quot;&gt;“Rant”&lt;/a&gt; to this post because it apparently has turned into one.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I digress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite what I (and many others out there) think, people are not as boring as they may at first glance be. We all have a mind, and we all have a history. We all have to like &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. So what I am trying to do (and perhaps you might want to as well) is to live in such a way that I won’t be that person existing in the past or boring people with the same old thing. Read a book, learn a musical instrument, learn how something complicated works (like a computer or a car), or even just read the encyclopedia! (Although I must admit that most people would be more apt to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; instead.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basically it is time for people to become more interesting.&lt;/strong&gt; I know that it’s there, so let’s all make it happen.

You wouldn’t think too much since he was dressed in a business casual manner so he fit in with the corporate surroundings. But wait! Something isn’t quite right…ah yes there it is… He is wearing a brown shoe on his right foot and a black one on his left. Ah you see him scurrying back to his car as he realizes his mistake. You might later discover that he keeps his shoes in his truck because he only wears them for work (and wears some &lt;a href=&quot;http://rainbowsandals.com/zzPremierLeathers.asp#Double%20Layer%20Arch,%20Premier%20Leather&quot;&gt;Sierra Browns&lt;/a&gt; for all of the time up to and after he absolutely has to put his shoes on). Additionally, that particular morning he decided to just put his shoes on while sitting in the front seat. Unfortunately it was rather dark in the parking structure (as many such structures can be) and he simply reached back to grab his shoes while continuing to listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/MELt8z&quot;&gt;his music&lt;/a&gt;. He even tried to hold them up to check them after he grabbed them, but seeing as the light was very dim would be unable to differentiate between dark colors (such as say brown and black). Even as he put them on he thought that the laces felt different but in his own silly manner he didn’t bother to look at them when in better light. And thus goes another day in his life. A small glimmer of amusement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what would you think?

Now that I look at them, they seem rather rudimentary but far be it from me to keep something that I found useful from others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;(I’ve been trying to figure this one out for awhile.) To search for a string from one buffer in another buffer:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C-w&lt;/strong&gt; (or &lt;strong&gt;M-w&lt;/strong&gt;) the search string&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;move to the buffer to search in&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C-s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M-y&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Synchronized scrolling: &lt;strong&gt;M-x scroll-all-mode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scroll other window:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M-C-v&lt;/strong&gt; scrolls down&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M-C-V&lt;/strong&gt; scrolls up&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Repeat a command numerous times: &lt;strong&gt;M-(number) (command)&lt;/strong&gt; where you fill in (number) with a number and (command) with the command that you want to repeat.

An example: to kill 10 lines you would do: &lt;strong&gt;M-1 0 C-k&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notes: &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt; is the Meta key (usually Alt or Esc depending on your operating system/settings) &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; is the Control key&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emacs can be great if you know how to use it. :)&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Ostentatious</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/ostentatious/"/> <updated>2007-02-19T10:30:37-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/ostentatious</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[os-ten-&lt;strong&gt;tey&lt;/strong&gt;-sh_uh_ s]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Definition:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Characterized by intending to impress others with obvious and conspicuous show.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;example-of-usage&quot;&gt;Example of usage:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The engagement ring is a significant symbol to people but the 4 carat diamond that she keeps flaunting is simply ostentatious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;Comments:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;This word is a synonym of “showy” and can be incorporated to more aptly describe someone’s behavior rather than saying that they are “showing-off”, as is more commonly done.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>RSS</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/rss-2/"/> <updated>2007-02-15T14:19:47-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/rss-2</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read this&lt;/strong&gt; (even if you think that this is going to be another nerdy entry)!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might learn something. I have found that there are a whole lot of people who have no idea what RSS is. That’s a shame because I think that a lot of them would find it to be useful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RSS stands for &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;eally &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;imple &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;yndication and is a really easy way to view the content for dynamic (frequently changing) websites. Good examples of websites that change frequently are news sites, blogs, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m sure that you could see the icons (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feedicons.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) around the Internet on web pages if you really looked. To utilize this technology, you have to understand what it is. Basically an RSS “feed” is a special link to a website that allows you to quickly see the content that is being changed on the site.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So to start off, you obviously you need a feed reader (also called an aggregator or a news aggregator) in order to view the content of your feeds. If you use Firefox you can try &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/424/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or even subscribe with Firefox itself using “Live Bookmarks”. There are also tons more that you can find online. I tried one from &lt;a href=&quot;http://email.about.com/od/rssfeedreaders/Find_the_Best_RSS_Feed_Readers_News_Aggregators.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that worked just fine. Once you have your reader install, you definitely need at least one site to get a feed from. You can find the links on pages, and often times these links will be sensed by your web browser and display an icon in the address bar that makes it easy to subscribe to. An example of a link would be: &lt;strong&gt;http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoingTheWongWay?format=xml&lt;/strong&gt; Once you have this link, and input this into your reader in whatever way you are supposed to, you are up and running!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To give you even more incentive of why you should do this, it turns out that you can use this for other blogging sites that you might not have thought of. For the xanga readers, you are essentially doing this when you read “Your Subscriptions”. You can incorporate xanga sites into your new RSS feed reader using links like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xanga.com/rss.aspx?user=keleka&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; where you just replace the “keleka” part of that address with the user that you’re subscribing to. Add a whole bunch of those links and suddenly you have an easy way to read a whole bunch of different types of “subscriptions”. Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>New Look</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/new-look/"/> <updated>2007-02-09T15:03:06-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/new-look</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/02/09/83-beautiful-wordpress-themes-you-probably-havent-seen/&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digg.com&quot;&gt;digg&lt;/a&gt; I realized that I wanted a new theme. So here it is courtesy of one Wolfgang Bartelme.

It’s there, you just have to know how to handle it. Here are some that I thought especially amusing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Library&lt;/strong&gt; So I’m reading &lt;em&gt;Main Street&lt;/em&gt; by Sinclair Lewis (as you can read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-reading/main-street/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) but I’m only halfway done. Additionally I have already renewed it the maximum number of times. So I go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.anaheim.net/article.cfm?id=118&quot;&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; and find the other copy to check out. Just before I get to the line to check it out, this lady comes in with her son and a BOX of books to donate or something. Additionally the other librarian is occupied with someone who has a whole bunch of questions. Thus I ended up waiting along with this other lady. We also happened to be right next to their new self-checkout machine. The lady and I discussed that we should try it. So I did. I put my library card down to scan, and then I tried to scan the book. But I used the wrong bar code. In this time an old asian guy cut in front of us and took the librarian just as she was free from the question lady. I was tempted to say something but I had pity on him because he was old. Plus we were really looking at the machine so I guess it’s slightly valid. But only slightly. Anyways, I forgot that the library has their own bar code inside the front cover rather than the general bar code on the back. When I realized this, I tried again and it worked! Happily I walked out and set off the alarm. As soon as I heard it I burst into laughter. Now anyone who has heard me laugh knows that it is slightly unbecoming a person in a public library. Haha apparently I forgot to push the spine against the edge in my self-checkout process. Suffice to say I thought it was funny, but the people reading quietly might not have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost&lt;/strong&gt; I’m sure many people watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/a&gt; last night. And there are probably loads of posts about what happened and how exciting or dull or horrible it was. But I would venture to say that none of those blog posts are the same as this one. As I was watching the episode, I saw something that triggered my memory. That beach that Sawyer and Kate were on at the end when leaving the island…&lt;strong&gt;I was on that beach!&lt;/strong&gt; Now you will probably want to know why or how I know this. Well this past summer I went to Hawaii for a couple of weeks with some friends. One of my friends has a place out there because he’s going to school there so he knows of all of these local spots. One day we went to this random beach where nobody was. There might have also been a sign somewhere that said to stay off, but I can’t exactly remember. Haha anyways it was fun and the beach was very picturesque. It was in this little cove/bay with a big house on one side. We snorkeled and looked at coral and stuff. It was quite nice. As we were leaving we also heard some people on horseback walking by and talking about how Lost was filmed there. I thought that was cool but thought nothing more of it until last night. I saw that beach and I am fairly certain that was the beach that we were at. Haha I thought that was awesome and hilarious. Well the hilarious part was telling my sister about it and her being incredulous that I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; not have supposed to have even been there. :D&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amusing stuff, my life. Anyone’s can be, you just need to know where to look.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Superbowl</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/superbowl/"/> <updated>2007-02-04T23:16:10-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/superbowl</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I’m sure that there are many entries out in the blog world about the exciting moments from the Superbowl, funny commercials, and numerous other topics. &lt;strong&gt;This one is more important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me tell you, what stood out to me when I was watching the coverage and heard the stories about everything, was the life of Tony Dungy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are unaware of who this is, he is the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts (the winning team of the Superbowl). As I was hearing his story and reminded of the fact that this was the man who lost his 18-year old soon all too recently, I could not help but feel that this man had to be living differently. His players and peers talked about how much they respected him, how he did not cuss (where the only time that he did was when he said that he was going to be on the “Best Damn Sports Show”), and numerous other character traits. So I looked him up to see if he was a Christian. And here are some of the things that I found: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_63714.asp&quot;&gt;link 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/feature/featureVideo?page=amazinggrace&quot;&gt;link 2&lt;/a&gt; and many others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is a man who is unafraid to live differently, who affects the lives of those around him even in a sub-culture of extreme opulence and outrageous antics. He is a man who strives to be the best, is currently there, but does not let that stand in the way of who he really is. Whether on top or on bottom, he is someone who seems to me has got it straight. And I like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I had known about this before, I would have cheered a little harder for the Colts (not that I was cheering for the Bears anyways). Nevertheless my hats off to a man can do what seems to be so difficult in the world today: he brings his Christian beliefs into his life simply be being who he is. He makes people &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; why he is the way that he is. He fights the good fight seemingly with his head squarely on his shoulders and his feet squarely on the Rock.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>DNS Confusion</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/dns-confusion/"/> <updated>2007-02-02T09:38:15-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/dns-confusion</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So last night I encountered a fairly common error. For some reason (I still don’t know why) the Internet connection at home was not working. Now this meant that I would have to renew the IP address (and thereafter update the DNS to reflect this change). I had done this at least once before so it was pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HOWEVER, after changing the host record on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.namecheap.com&quot;&gt;namecheap’s&lt;/a&gt; site, the DNS would still not redirect me to the correct IP address (my own). Bah, so I figured that there was a refresh problem and just went to sleep. (I also turned off the server as I do every night in case you might be wondering why you can’t get to it at night). I woke up this morning and checked it out to see what was up. Still no change. How could this be?! I tried updating it and checking it over and over. I finally realized something was terribly wrong. I thought that perhaps it had to do with submitting my site to google’s index so I tried removing it. I have since realized that probably has nothing to do with it. Then I came to the conclusion that namecheap might not be as optimal as previously thought. That’s too bad. But no love lost since it’s not a big deal. Thus I transferred the DNS services to &lt;a href=&quot;http://zoneedit.com/&quot;&gt;zoneedit&lt;/a&gt; which has an ugly site but has good reviews. They took a little while (~30 min) to transfer the DNS as well as update the host record. Pretty good. We’ll see how it holds up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So in sum, we’re back online! :D&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Algorithm For Your Life</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/algorithm-for-your-life/"/> <updated>2007-02-01T15:58:46-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/algorithm-for-your-life</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You might wonder whether this entry is worth reading, especially if you are like most people who don’t even know what an algorithm really is. Let me tell you, you should still read this because it applies to life. Yes that’s right, &lt;strong&gt;life&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had a professor at UCSD during my 3rd year of school for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/classes/wi05/cse101/&quot;&gt;CSE 101: Design and Analysis of Algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. On the first day, the class was packed as usual so everyone could get the syllabus. This red-haired, awkward, sweaty man stood in front of us and mumbled about different things. The biggest lesson that I learned from that class was on that first day. It wasn’t concerning greedy, backtracking, or any other type of algorithm, though. It was about life. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/russell/&quot;&gt;Professor Russell Impagliazzo&lt;/a&gt; said&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your algorithm is correct, you think that it’s correct. If your algorithm is incorrect, you think that it is correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now you might wonder how in the world this applies to you let alone to &lt;strong&gt;life&lt;/strong&gt;. On that day way back when, I learned of a way to put into words something that I could see was true. First let me define an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;al·go·rithm [al-guh-rith-uhm] –noun a set of rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps, as for finding the greatest common divisor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically that means that an algorithm is a sequence of steps to do something. It’s a method by which you accomplish something. Now there are obviously correct algorithms, incorrect algorithms, efficient algorithms, inefficient ones, etc. The truth in Professor Impagliazzo’s words are that people are going to always think that they’re right, even if they’re wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think about it. Then think some more about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s true. People always think that they’re right, even if in light of absolute truth they are wrong. The reason is this: if people knew that they were wrong, then they would change so that they were right. Only a fool of the greatest magnitude would remain wrong if they knew that they were wrong. You’d be hard-pressed to find a fool such as this who knew deep-down in their very being that they were wrong about something and refused to change to what they knew was “right” (whatever that means in each case).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’d be surprised at how much you can encounter this phenomenon in life. I know that I was. Now go, change the world! Or at least realize that just because you think that you’re right, does not make it so. If everyone approached problems and their own “algorithm” to life with such honesty, I daresay that we would end up striving for not only a better “algorithm”, but we would find that we desire &lt;strong&gt;absolute truth&lt;/strong&gt;. And no, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything&amp;amp;btnG=Search&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt; is not the answer that I’m talking about.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Fanaticism</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/fanaticism/"/> <updated>2007-01-28T16:42:01-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/fanaticism</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I must write a little something about something that I’ve noticed recently. Fanatics. Granted, I’m not talking about the extreme fanatics who come to mind as choosing to give up their life to kill others. I’m talking about the simple everyday fanatics that someone like me might encounter. There are a few examples that I have seen that are fairly interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows vs Apple (vs Linux (vs [insert OS]))&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone is aware of this brand of geek fanaticism. Countless Apple users proclaim the goodness of their own computer. They follow every move that Mr. Jobs makes as if he were some sort of god. They are eager at every opportunity to shoot down the evil Microsoft users as geeky, sheep-following idiots. Add the Linux users who are (generally) also very eager to shoot down the users of other operating systems as lame and uncompromising in their closed-source, proprietary, corporate evil methodology. Microsoft Windows users often don’t really join in the fray because either they are not aware of the fray occurring or they don’t really care. But those who do, stick by their guns and enjoy comparing themselves with overpriced, unimpressive, don’t-live-up-to-our-compatibility products from the competition. This is an interesting battle because people have been known to be for one of the many sides, and the fact of the matter is that they shouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have been especially interested in this topic because I have been looking at getting myself a Macbook Pro 15” for sometime now. I was following them and the news stories about them since before they came out (which means I’ve been reading about them for over a year now). And I also currently use Ubuntu (a Linux operating system for the uninitiated) on my home computer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VI vs Emacs (vs Visual Studio (vs TextPad vs Eclipse, et al))&lt;/strong&gt; The battle of the editors is a favorite amongst programmers. It’s an interesting one because it’s similar to other battles amongst programmers (i.e. programming language battles of the sort of Java vs C++ or PHP vs Python vs Ruby on Rails) that often occur. I have come to the conclusion that programmers (in comparison to a vast majority of people) use the fact that they can understand things in their reasoning for becoming fanatics for something. Simply because they think they know, they proclaim that they know. The reality is that one must see these editors, IDE’s, programming languages, etc tools. They are things to be used when a certain task arises. Simply because one loves a particular sledgehammer does not mean that ones uses said sledgehammer to do everything. But I digress. VI has some good points (excellent use of the QWERTY layout so minimal finger travel is require) while Emacs has other good points (ability to do pretty much anything that you want). And the list goes on for different editors. But the fact of the whole argument remains that it’s a matter of preference and you can find knowledgeable and intelligent people using either. Don’t close yourself to the idea that it doesn’t really matter what one uses if they are able to get the job done. I recently encountered this a little bit at work because both of my co-workers use TextPad when they are coding. I had never heard of this program before but it’s basically a Windows application that’s has a fairly robust feature set for programming. However, I recently started using Emacs at work in order to see if I was more efficient with it. And I find that it has many features and shortcuts that I am hard pressed to give up. However, I still use TextPad because frankly it’s much more easily integrated into a Windows working environment. In addition to this, I still use VI some of the time because that is all that is on the main server (it runs a fairly old version of Unix). So I deal with it all, and it’s oh so fun. :P&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are other issues I’m sure, and perhaps I’ll add my thoughts on them when I encounter them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The truth and lesson that can be derived from this topic is one that can be applied to many unrelated issues in life. Apple has a good product, yes. Proof enough of this is in their recent success. Linux has good points as well as noted by its up and coming status. Microsoft must have something in their Windows operating system else they would not perennially be on top. But what one can learn is this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are many choices and we must not go and align ourselves with one or the other as if one were perfect and the others are not. We can think clearly about the matter and see that they are all lacking in certain regards. &lt;strong&gt;Take the good, and leave the rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like this idea in other matters of life as well. The only time that I’ve found that this doesn’t fly is in the face of true absolute truth (i.e. the Bible). Suffice to say, not much else in life is absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Cheaters 4 Life</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/cheaters-4-life/"/> <updated>2007-01-24T12:40:31-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/cheaters-4-life</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is something that happens nearly everyday. And yet we live with it. Cheaters are in our midst, dear friends. And I’m going to spend a few minutes to let my thoughts leave my head and enter yours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So everyday I drive to and from work. Now that’s normal, but I am mostly troubled in the morning. I am often stuck in traffic and I can see people speeding by in the carpool lane. Now don’t get me wrong, I am all for having a carpool lane and rewarding those who are willing to sacrifice some freedom (by having to deal with multiple people in the same car) in order to conserve gas. That’s just fine. But what perturbs me is that there are those who cheat (those who are by themselves in the car). You might be one of those people, you might despise them like myself, or you might not even care. Nonetheless, I will tell you why I cannot stand them. So obviously it it unfair and worthy of outrage simply because it is breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even more than that, there is a saying that I either heard or made up that goes something along the lines of &lt;strong&gt;“whatever you do in one thing, you will do in all things”&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that if one is patient with the small tasks, they will be more likely to be patient with other things. And likewise if one is a cheater in the small things, then they are much more likely to be a cheater in other areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a matter of character. It’s about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:18;&amp;amp;version=49;&quot;&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; people! They knew it before, and it remains true simply because it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I propose these thoughts to enter into your thinking and perhaps change something in your thought process: Would you want to marry someone who drives in the carpool lane? It seems maybe insignificant but one who can’t even stay true to the law won’t be the most difficult to persuade to not stay true to their love. One who isn’t patient enough to spend 15 minutes extra to wait like the rest of us is someone who will always long for the here and now. Is there remorse in their eyes? Why do they not even care? Is it even a big deal or do small things just seem insignificant to them? Well let’s be frank, insignificance is often a matter of opinion. And more and more issues will become “insignificant” as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Evaluate everything again and remember that it’s dangerous to over think things but it’s likewise dangerous to not think at all. Be well and make some wiser choices because they mean something in the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*edited January 24, 2006 10:54 PM&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Master...</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/master/"/> <updated>2007-01-23T13:19:17-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/master</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;of my own domain.

I have only read good things about them online, and I have found in my brief experience that it is true that they are just dandy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other news: updating wordpress is super easy. Those wordpress people are pretty awesome. I like their software.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, I will be creating sub domains in the future for my other applications. Stay tuned. Same wong place, same wong channel, blah blah blah. :D&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Sell Your Porsche</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/sell-your-porsche/"/> <updated>2007-01-11T09:57:40-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/sell-your-porsche</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you ever encounter during the normal happenings of the day that you see something that strikes you as a little bit odd? Well this morning I saw just one of those things, and it got me to thinking a little bit. A dangerous thing sometimes, I know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was driving to work this morning, and I saw a Porsche 911 Turbo. That’s a pretty nice car, you know? “MSRP: $122900” when I just searched for it just now. That’s a pretty hefty amount. In fact, that’s a stupendous amount. It’s the classic fast, sleek, 2-passenger, mid-life-crisis-that-some-will-admit-but-some-won’t type of car.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why did this cause me to think anymore than the next expensive car you might ask?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This one had a whole bunch of anti-Bush bumper stickers on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That seemed odd to me because frankly you don’t really see that. Well, at least &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don’t see that. I see old run-down cars with enough stickers on it that you think that’s the paint job that they ordered. I see nice cars with not a spot on them, let alone a nasty bumper sticker. But here was this car with things like “Obama for president” and “&lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;orst ever”. It seems strange because it seems, based on past experience, that rich people don’t really express their views like that. Additionally, the more affluent people (and this is a generalization obviously) tend to be more Republican in nature. Interesting. Now just because I don’t believe that President Bush is the worst president ever (not with the likes of Buchanan, Johnson, and Harding having already served), but that is beside the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The points are this: 1) If I wanted your political opinions or stance, I would ask. 2) Don’t ruin your nice car with gross bumper stickers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The solutions are simple (corresponding solution to afore-mentioned points): 1) Everyone should put a small “Y” or “N” on their car in a specified location depending on what the current hot topic of the day is. This can be organized by some non-profit organization in order for everyone to know what everyone feels if they really want to know. Marvelous. 2) (directed at the man with the Porsche) Buy yourself an old car to put your bumper stickers on and use the difference to actually do something. Your bumper stickers do nothing for the world except rile people up and give the bumper sticker manufacturers a larger profit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything seems simple until you take every singe point of view, I guess. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> <entry> <title>Hello world!</title> <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/hello-world-2/"/> <updated>2007-01-05T23:49:43-08:00</updated> <id>http://www.goingthewongway.com/hello-world-2</id> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my first post from a blog that I’m hosting on my own web server. This software is pretty efficient because it was able to install in an extremely quick amount of time. I like that. I like software that works. However, I also like it when I understand what it’s doing. It’s just my thing.&lt;/p&gt; </content> </entry> </feed>
