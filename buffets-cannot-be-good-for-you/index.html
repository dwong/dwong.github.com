<div class="entry-content"><p>Now I enjoy a buffet just as much as the next person.  They&#8217;re usually a pretty good value in terms of how much food you get for your dollar.  However, the other day when I was at <a href="http://www.oldcountrybuffet.com/">Hometown Buffet</a>, I noticed a few things that I thought were interesting while I was there.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There are a lot of obese people at buffets.</p></li>
<li><p>I feel really heavy afterwards and even the next morning compared to how I normally feel.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a <em>lot</em> of food that goes into you&#8230;and comes out.</p></li>
<li><p>I was sweaty and felt warm even though the weather was cool.</p></li>
<li><p>I could have eaten 1 plate and have been satisfied.  Instead I ate 4 plates.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I was thinking (and discussing over dinner) that buffets seem to be very indicative of society.  There is a huge problem with obesity and our eating habits are only part of that.  But just go to a buffet and see how many of the people there have a personal problem with obesity.  It&#8217;s ridiculous.</p>

<p>Even beyond that, I felt really sorry for the kids.  Children don&#8217;t do things of their own volition, they are taught and raised by their parents.  So when there is an obese child, I&#8217;d go so far as to say that the parents have caused them to be that way.  And that is so unfortunate.  Sure I have to take into account that different people have different metabolisms, etc.  Nevertheless, nobody has to be that obese.  Anyways, back to the point.  So parents have chosen for their kids to live in obesity and unhealthily.  That is so much more tragic because it is almost upon them without them being able to do much about it.  I have much less empathy for adults who are in a similar situation because they know what they&#8217;re doing.</p>

<p>So there it is.  Buffets are good.  They taste good.  You get to eat whatever you want.  But they&#8217;re not really too good for you.  Go eat some fruit.</p>
