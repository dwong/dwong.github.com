Well it is basically that small icon that you see next to the url when you go to a site. There are different icons for different sites as I’m sure most of you have noticed. This is basically a special “ico” file that is a tiny picture format.</p> <p>It’s very easy to create one. At the very simplest you can just go to <a href="http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/">a pretty good online favicon generator</a> and submit a picture to convert. They’ll allow you to download the resulting file. Then to use this file with your site, you have to upload or somehow place the file on your server, and add this:</p> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://example.com/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"&gt; &lt;/link&gt; </code> to the page that your users will see (typically something like index.html) in between “&lt;head&gt;” and “&lt;/head&gt;”. Then you would replace the “http://example.com/favicon.ico” with the corresponding path to get to your file. And that’s it!</p> <p>Of course you could do things like edit it in the excellent <a href="http://gimp.org/">gimp</a> and add some transparency, etc before you convert it. And you can obviously use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">adobe’s expensive product</a> to do this (although if you already ponied up for this you better know how to make favicons :P).</p> <p>That’s it, you have a nice little personal touch for your website! Enjoy!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-few-the-proud-native-californians/"> The Few, The Proud, Native Californians </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 12</span> <p>I saw a license plate frame this morning on the way to work that looked a little like this:</p> <p>The Few, The Proud</p> <p>0ZZZ000</p> <p>Native Californians</p> <p>And I was just wondering who in the world was driving this car? I <em>thought</em> that it was a woman based on the hair that she had, but who knows? I thought that maybe she was the wife of a marine because there was a large sticker on the window of the marines. So I was thinking that she likely would be someone who simply was born and raised on California. However, I wondered about who truly COULD drive a car with that license plate frame. Would it be the Mexicans (well Spaniards then I suppose)? Would it be the native Americans (commonly known as the Indians because of one Christopher Columbus? Can anyone who is born and raised in California proudly bear the frame on their automobile?</p> <p>I’m definitely not a fan of someone who proclaims to be something they’re not (imagine someone who graduates from one school driving around with an alumni frame from another school).</p> <p>Interesting thought don’t you think? I’ve never seen that license plate frame, and I’m sure that most people wouldn’t think much more of it than the fact that they are a proud Californian. But there seems to be something to it, don’t you think? The dislike of people who proclaim to be something that they’re not. The truth that you find when you dig a little bit deeper. Or you find the seeming distaste that people have for thinking further than what their next meal would be. What a tragic life.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/aplomb/"> Aplomb </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 12</span> <p>[uh-<strong>plom</strong>, uh-<strong>pluhm</strong>]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>Poise, composure, or self-assurance.</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>Having to process 1,000 cases in 2 hours was daunting to say the least, but she handled it with aplomb.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>This word is a much more interesting word to use than others, and it seems to be somewhat colloquial in its rather specific uses. Nonetheless it is an interesting word whose simple structure does not betray its true meaning to the uninitiated (translation: you probably can’t figure out what it means if you don’t already know what it means). It’s usually used when talking about facing difficult circumstances.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/disaster/"> Disaster </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 11</span> <p>There are disasters all over the world, but somehow when there’s one that’s closer to home, it changes your perspective. So apparently the fire that has been going on today in Anaheim Hills is actually not all too far away from home. In fact, El Modena High School is one of the shelters, and that school is in my distract. As a matter of fact it’s probably only 5-10 minutes away!</p> <p>It makes you think about how things are. Our lives are based on so much that is simply temporary. When something changes and we are left with whatever we are left with, then we are left with the choice to decide what is truly important in our life. What will we choose? Some of us will choose to pursue a life of pleasure (whether that means obtain “things” or satisfying oneself somehow). Some of us will decide that life isn’t worth it anymore. Some of us will continue on doing what we think that we are supposed to be doing just as we have been doing all of our lives (not considering the reason or logic to why we do it all). Some of us will attempt to live for “something greater” (whatever that may entail). No matter what, it is intriguing to think about the fact that we are not the same once we are under duress. As it is, a fairly insignificant percentage of people in the United States are actually under hardships such as these that make them re-evaluate their lives. Have you ever thought about it?</p> <p>Changes are not usually easy. Some are even more difficult. I’d rather not waste my life, thank you very much.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/your-own-b-u-s-i-n-e-s-s/"> Your Own B-U-S-I-N-E-S-S </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 9</span> <p>After reading a Los Angeles Times article similar in content to <a href="http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2007/03/08/News/Facebook.Group.Lands.Usc.Football.Player.In.Hot.Water-2764591.shtml?reffeature=recentlycommentedstoriestab">this</a> article, I knew that I just had to make some comments about it. In this politically correct country where everyone has their say and is entitled to their rights, there are many people who think that it’s all very outlandish and ridiculous. And not in the funny or amusing way. I am one of those people.</p> <p>Granted, I don’t think that creating a facebook about the “Arian [sic] nation” is necessarily something great. But it’s obviously a joke and to make such a big deal about it is absurd. They were printed in the LA Times, for crying out loud! Ridiculous.</p> <p>I’ll be honest with you. I can’t stand people that blow things out of proportion like that. They get hung up on the smallest things, but they have no idea that they are missing the big picture. How did this politically correct trend begin? Was it women’s suffrage, or black rights, or what? I have no idea because I’m no history buff or even well-versed in politics, but all I know is that it’s irritatingly everywhere.</p> <p>I propose that these people just quit acting like their feelings were hurt and get a sense of humor. I’ve read that one (of two) of the worst things to hear is that you are humorless and cannot take a joke. Well that is what I’m saying to this Stefanie Gopaul. Live a little and quit living your life by riding off the lives of those around you.</p> <p>Great, another rant.</p> <p><em>Edit</em> Haha I can’t believe that I messed up the HTML so badly that the link wasn’t showing! People must think that I sounded crazy talking about an article that they couldn’t even read.
