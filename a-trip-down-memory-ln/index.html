<div class="entry-content"><p>So this weekend I went to San Diego (well more like La Jolla, home to <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu">my favorite college</a>) in part to hang out and visit but also in part to celebrate with <a href="http://www.adropofwater.net">Mr. Hoffman</a> and Miss Lin as they got engaged.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights were getting to go to the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/fpfBFfgbclSjMYMZXpo7lg">new location</a> of <a href="http://www.philsbbq.com">Phil&#8217;s BBQ</a> (one of the best BBQ eateries around in my opinion), getting to hang out with friends, and getting to hang out at <a href="http://www.xanga.com/redbricks">Allison&#8217;s</a> place.  But it made me realize that even though college was fun, I do not long for the things in the past.  Unfortunately, there are many out there that do.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I have found that it is rather interesting when you encounter people who constantly have a desire for what has happened before.  There are the older people who long for &#8220;the good old days&#8221;, and there are friends who seem to have only had a couple of note-worthy experiences in their entire life that they enjoy re-hashing over and over again.  There are those that tell the same jokes repeatedly thinking that the humor of the joke continues to remain constant, and there are those who restrict themselves based on what&#8217;s happened in the past.  Frankly I find that none of those approaches make much sense.  What is life if we are unable to change ourselves and have new experiences?  How can we have great experiences if we are stuck in the pat re-living the old antiquated ones?  The simple answer is that we can&#8217;t.  (Note: I just had to add the category <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/category/rant/">&#8220;Rant&#8221;</a> to this post because it apparently has turned into one.)</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>Despite what I (and many others out there) think, people are not as boring as they may at first glance be.  We all have a mind, and we all have a history.  We all have to like <em>something</em>.  So what I am trying to do (and perhaps you might want to as well) is to live in such a way that I won&#8217;t be that person existing in the past or boring people with the same old thing.  Read a book, learn a musical instrument, learn how something complicated works (like a computer or a car), or even just read the encyclopedia!  (Although I must admit that most people would be more apt to read <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">this</a> instead.)</p>

<p><strong>Basically it is time for people to become more interesting.</strong>  I know that it&#8217;s there, so let&#8217;s all make it happen.  Good luck to you.</p>
