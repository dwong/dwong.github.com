Take passport pictures for example. There are specifications and guidelines such that most people won’t really want to study them in order to make their own pictures. So because of that, they’ll gladly just pay someone 8 bucks (or whatever it is) for a couple of 2” x 2” pictures of their face. Outrageous! Good thing you have other options.</p> <p>I wanted to make some passport pictures for <a href="http://redbricks.xanga.com/">someone that I know</a> because she needed more than the usual 2. Because of that, I’m not sure how much it would cost. And on top of that, I always thought it was unfortunate how much places would charge you for passport pictures anyways.</p> <p>So I searched online, and I found <a href="http://www.dpchallenge.com/tutorial.php?TUTORIAL_ID=22">this great tutorial</a> that shows you how to make your own passport pictures! I followed the tutorial, but I used <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the Gimp</a> instead.</p> <p>The Gimp (Gnu Image Manipulation Program) is an <a href="http://amzn.to/RGY3pA">Adobe Photoshop</a> replacement that is both open-source AND free. That means that all of you cheap suckers out there can use this for nothing instead of that hacked version of Photoshop that you’re currently running (which is illegal both in law and in spirit). It’s also pretty robust in my opinion, but then again I’m not wizard at image manipulation anyways. Anyways, the Gimp has all of the necessary tools available but here are some helpful pointers from a beginner who already has done it. I didn’t want to just put the whole tutorial here because I didn’t make it. If you want to use it, then go there. However, for some completeness the steps are basically:</p> <h3 id="basic-steps">Basic Steps</h3> <ol> <li>Measure from the chin to the top of the head to get the number of pixels.</li> <li>Calculate the DPI (dots per inch) that you’ll need for your particular picture because in the end you’ll need 1-1.375 inches from the chin to the top of the head. <ul> <li>Divide measured pixels from chin to the top of the head by how many inches you want (from 1 to 1.375 inches). That gives you pixels/inches which is the same as DPI.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do a fixed size select. Since you want a 2” x 2” picture in the end, you’ll have to multiply the DPI that you previously got by 2. So if you calculated a DPI of 530 as in the tutorial, then you would do a fixed size select of 1060 by 1060. Copy the selected area.</li> <li>Create a new file with a size of 4” x 6” (or whatever size you want, I actually made an 8.5” x 11”). Then change the resolution to whatever your DPI is.</li> <li>Paste however many pictures you need from your fixed size selection to the new file. Position them so that you’ll have room to cut them out, etc</li> <li>You’re done!</li> </ol> <h3 id="helpful-hints">Helpful Hints</h3> <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/221/471460304_170c90bfff_o.jpg" alt="measure_tool"/> The measuring tool is located in the toolbox as indicated. It works similarly to the Photoshop tool in the tutorial.</p> <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/170/471460310_ddc25bdc26_o.jpg" alt="fixed_size"/> When using the rectangle select, you don’t have to use the free select. Use the fixed size option as shown here (after doing the calculations in the tutorial).</p> <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/183/471460290_754e33b34b_o.jpg" alt="new_image"/> Make sure to specify the new file in inches according to how you want to print it. Then the resolution should be made to equal your DPI (this makes sure that your picture will turn out to be the right size).</p> <p>Also, not to sound like <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/fanaticism/">a fanatic</a> but long live open source software! :D</p> <p>Update: if you specifically want a U.S. passport picture, the State Department has <a href="http://travel.state.gov/_res/flash/cropper/FIG_cropper.html">this Adobe Flash tool</a>, which is extremely easy to use!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/worth-the-wait/"> Worth The Wait </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 23</span> <p>I want to wait But I don’t know if I can stay strong. If something comes along, I don’t know if I want to wait that long.</p> <p>You seem so far I am so tempted by near things. In my head, A definite doubt rings.</p> <p>“You need to give in” And “It’s not worth the wait”. Right there, Those are some thoughts that I hate.</p> <p>I want it to be right I want to choose in a wise fashion. Instead of waiting To do the dashin’.</p> <p>I wonder if I’m just strange, Everyone else seems alright. They’re all satisfied They don’t lay awake and suffer in the night.</p> <p>Longing for that Which is not yet here. Won’t you come And be with me, dear.</p> <p>What am I saying? Do you have even a clue? Well dear friends I’m being dumb, that’s true.</p> <p>I just wrote a poem And the meaning is not Exactly what you thought. You won’t think it’s hot.</p> <p>Sometimes I need, To really go. Sometimes I am My own worst foe.</p> <p>The relief that comes After releasing the stress. Sometimes I think That is the best.</p> <p>The bathroom is sometimes where I wish to be at. At that time, I don’t want to chat.</p> <p>I wonder if you can Guess the other thought. If you do then great, On here you should jot!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/scintillate/"> Scintillate </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 23</span> <p>[<strong>sin</strong>-tl-eyt]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>To emit sparks</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>When she said that she didn’t mind kissing and telling, she was completely honest! Her descriptions included all of the scintillating details.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>Okay so I actually this that this is interesting because I looked up the word before I posted it, and it seemed like a slightly different definition than I expected. It makes sense for scintillate to mean to emit sparks, but for most of the times that I’ve encountered it, it has been used more metaphorically. There is the usage in terms of sparks as between lovers. And there is the usage for someone who is very witty and quick. Hm, I guess we all learn something everyday, don’t we?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/texting-champion/"> Texting Champion </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 23</span> <p>I’m not sure how many people text a whole lot. I’m assuming that there are many of them out there. Now personally I am not a big fan of it. Not because it’s inconvenient or useless but rather because I don’t appreciate getting “nickeled and dimed” (in this case literally). You might say that’s cheap, but that’s just the truth. I don’t appreciate paying for the cell phone plan and on top of that getting charged the lousy 10 cents to both send <em>and</em> receive a text message (of course this is more specific to <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/">Verizon</a> than it is to all cellular phone carriers in the United States. Anyways, enough about my personal feelings about texting. The real reason that I thought about texting today was because I read about Miss Morga Pozgar who is now the reigning texting champion!</p> <p>I read about this last night in <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/22/morgan-pozgar-wins-texting-championship-for-cheaters/">an Engadget article</a>, and I could hardly believe that they even have this competition! I think that the world is ridiculous because they sponsor such things. They give money to the person who is the quickest to type out long words. How can there be many people who would try for such a thing (okay granted I think that if I had known about it then I would try for it and see if I could win $25,000 for doing essentially nothing). But it’s amazing to see the kinds of things that go on in the world out of my eyes. Utterly amazing.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-long-and-short-of-it/"> The Long And Short Of It </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 20</span> <p>People don’t care what you have to do, just get it done.</p> <p>Have you ever noticed someone’s eyes drift or glaze over when you would be explaining something to them? Well it could be that you’re just boring them to death. But I was thinking about when I would occasionally be explaining why or how I got from point A to point B.</p> <p>Say for instance someone were to be interested in how you happened to come from the point you were at 5 years ago to this point right now. You would think about all of the different things that have happened, good and bad, small and little. You would want to talk about every little incident to truly show how or why or when you did what you did. But more often than not, it seems as if that person wants to basically just know a summary of the journey. They don’t want to hear how you felt 10 days after you experience unrequited love or how you felt during that all-nighter that would seemingly determine your future.</p> <p>It’s like that in the real world, too. It’s very accurate, in my opinion, to say that people just want you to get something done. They don’t want to hear about all of the problems that you had while getting there. At work, they will be much more interested in a final project (whether that’s a report or a program or a piece of art) than they will be in how you arrived at said destination. They don’t want to know how there was this tiny bug in your program that you couldn’t find for the longest time. They don’t want to know how you messed up the formatting of something and had to start over. I remember at a previous job that I had, we would have weekly lunch meetings where the new people would introduce themselves. A new guy on my team joined and there was the requisite introduction made along with the invitation to talk about what he did/was going to do at the company. This guy (who admittedly might have been slightly out of touch with American social norms because he seemed like he had not been born there) promptly got into talking about what he had done in the past week to get a particular function to work. He went on about how hard it was to figure it out but ended with saying that it looked promising and he was making headway. Want to know what I said when I introduced myself? I said, “I’m a student at UCSD studying Computer Science.” So you can imagine how I cringed at seeing him talk endlessly, which sent everyone in the room (temporarily) to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu">Timbuktu</a>.</p> <p>Another example is my morning routine. I have five alarms set each day. Now you must be wondering why I would have such a thing. Everyone is different, and here is what works for me:</p> <ul> <li> <p>I have my first alarm go off at a pleasant level of noise to the news on the radio on a clock radio.</p> </li> <li> <p>My second and third are tunes that are progressively louder on my cell phone.</p> </li> <li> <p>The fourth is a shrill and loud alarm on my cell phone.</p> </li> <li> <p>The fifth is a very loud and annoying alarm on the clock radio.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Wow this seems like a lot to me when I read it. However, I figure that this covers me for cases of when I am very tired (can’t get up at the first one or two alarms), and it also covers me for disasters (either my cell phone runs out of a battery or the electricity goes out). Do people care about this? Not really at all. In fact <a href="http://www.xanga.com/TuMbaLiNa3">some people</a> often question why I do the things that I do. But what’s really important and what do people really care about? Whether I got up in time or not!</p> <p>So basically, people don’t want to hear the details of the journey most of the time. This does not mean that the journey is not important. In fact, the journey is immensely important. However in many cases, people want to know the destination and end. They want the synopsis.</p> <p>That makes it all the more important to take note of this: <strong>if you find someone who is interested in the entire journey, you just found a “keeper.”</strong></p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page64">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page62">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
