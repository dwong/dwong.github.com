It’s not exactly a typical setup (but then again what fun what a “normal” setup be?). Even if you don’t have a Wordpress blog, feel free to read the list and find out about some of the software that is powering this blog. Maybe you’ll discover some features that you didn’t know about!</p> <p>And onward (not in order of preference or importance but rather just so that you can make sure that I have 13).</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://akismet.com">Akismet</a></li> </ol> <p>The ubiquitous spam comment catcher for the Wordpress community. It’s so popular and well-done that it’s a default plugin. I didn’t actually activate it initially because I didn’t think that I needed it as my blog doesn’t have extensive traffic. And thus I didn’t think that I would get picked up by any spammers. Of course I turned out to be wrong. And of course I got spammed hundreds of times. And of course it happened while I was on vacation. Ah ‘tis life.</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://ryanlee.org/software/wp/croissanga/">Croissanga</a></li> </ol> <p>Not a normal plugin to have I would think. But this is definitely a crucial one on my blog because of the community (small as it is) that I have on <a href="http://www.xanga.com/">xanga</a>. I enjoyed installing it because it allowed me to learn about <a href="http://php.net/curl">PHP cURL</a> (which is basically a way for you to access remote sites through PHP!). Additionally it definitely upped my readership and got the word out there about my blog. This is better than having to tell people about it. It gets old telling people to check out my blog.</p> <p>With some fairly prompt response to my report that Croissanga wasn’t working (within the week), Ryan stepped up and pushed out a new version to handle the changes. That is just sweet.</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-plugin/">Feedburner Feed Replacement</a></li> </ol> <p>Replacing the default RSS feed is useful because you can track more information by sending the feed through <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>. Very easy to set up, and there are some interesting things that you can learn through them that you wouldn’t if you hosted your RSS feed on your own site.</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://blog.jodies.de/archiv/2004/11/13/recent-comments/">Get Recent Comments</a></li> </ol> <p>This is a very useful plugin, in my opinion, because it gives you the ability to bring the comments part of your blog to the front and center (the main home of your blog). I encountered this by seeing it on other people’s blogs and thinking that it was very handy. You know when I publish a new post, and now you can know when someone else adds a new comment!</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://dev.lipidity.com/feature/wp-plugin-gregarious">Gregarious</a></li> </ol> <p>There is something that is very hot lately in the world of the Internet. If you haven’t heard of it, it’s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Bookmarking">social bookmarking</a>. Basically it’s a way for people to share what they find interesting with other people. This plugin allows your posts, pages, etc to have an instant connection with such sites as <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> or <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a>. I have this on my blog because I think that it’s cool and I try to participate in social bookmarking. However, I hardly think that my content is the type of stuff that will get put onto these sites. But if you feel that it is, feel very free to use the links on the side of each post!</p> <p>Worked with the author a little on <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/08/i-want-to-share-this/">fixing a slight bug</a> with the plugin, and I really appreciated Ankur’s responsiveness and work to fix it!</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://mattread.com/projects/wp-plugins/more-smilies-plugin/">More Smilies</a></li> </ol> <p>A plugin that allows you to choose different smilies to use in your blog. Basic and useful if you’re into customizing things.</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/widgets/trunk">Sidebar Widgets</a></li> </ol> <p>This is a big deal right now in the Wordpress community. Basically it allows you to have drag-and-drop functionality in your sidebar when you’re setting things up! A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget">widget</a> (in the web sense) is an arbitrary piece of code that conforms to some standards and can be dropped into place without any changes. This is a good way of approaching software projects (where you can just substitute in a component for another component and nothing will know about it), and it’s also a good way of approaching third party software like plugins. I am not currently using this too much, but I have every intention of doing so once I finish re-organizing the structure of the site. I might also have to write my own widget(s) if there isn’t one to do what I want. How fun! But this is seriously a plugin that you should use because it just makes customizing Wordpress even easier than it was before!</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://citizenk.wordpress.com/wp-plugins/statcounter-for-wordpress/">StatCounter for Wordpress</a></li> </ol> <p>An easy way to utilize a free service (<a href="http://www.statcounter.com">statcounter</a>) easily without having to muck around in the source code. This keeps the code clean while simply adding an action to the Wordpress functions. This appends the necessary code on each page and thus allows you to keep track of all of your pages! Very useful for those that like to know what is going on in terms of page loads, hits, etc.</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/">Subscribe To Comments</a></li> </ol> <p>This is an interesting plugin that I saw first-hand while looking at someone else’s blog. I was interested in it because I found it interesting to stay “in the loop” to the comments that were posted as follow-up discussion to the post that I was reading. Basically you check a box when you’re leaving a comment, and you will get an e-mail when a new comment is posted. Pretty nifty if you ask me!</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/">The Ultimate Tag Warrior</a></li> </ol> <p>Well first of all the name is just awesome, in my opinion. Additionally, I think that the functionality is pretty amazing. Basically it allows you to tag your posts with tags that you create. Continue to tag your posts and eventually you’ll end up with a list of tags that somewhat accurately (depending on how good you are at tagging) will represent what your site is generally about. I really enjoy the tag cloud in the sidebar because it gives a visual representation to how often I tag about certain things. And from there, if any particular tag is clicked, a new page will display that shows all of the posts that have that tag. Pretty nifty, if you ask me! There are numerous other ways to display aggregate tag information, but the plugin is even useful if you just want the tags to display for each post! It kind of gives a summary of what the post is about.</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://www.lesterchan.net/wordpress/readme/wp-stats.html">WP-Stats</a></li> </ol> <p>This plugin gives a you some statistics to your blog such as number of posts, number of commentators, and the like. Even though the information isn’t exactly ground-breaking, it’s still nice to just have a plugin that will allow you to easily see it.</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/random-redirect/">Random Redirect</a></li> </ol> <p>This is a really simple plugin in both idea and code. Basically it allows you to visit http://www.yoursite.com/?random and it will take you to a random post. I have yet to actually put a link somewhere to use this plugin, but I very much mean to sometime soon. If you’d like to, you can try it using <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/?random">a link to a random post on this site</a>.</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/">WP-Cache</a></li> </ol> <p>Although my site doesn’t exactly get hammered because of all of the traffic, I would still say that this is a great plugin to have. Basically it will save pages as they’re visited to a flat file. What does this do for you, you might ask. Well a flat file is much easier to serve than a dynamic page generated from PHP and MySQL. Thus your server will have less processing to do, and it will be able to serve the page more quickly! Even if your site doesn’t get a lot of traffic to actually utilize this plugin, there’s no difference if you do or do not have it. So I say that you might as well install it. Who knows, maybe you will get your site submitted to <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a>, and with this plugin you might be able to withstand the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg_effect">digg effect</a>!</p> <p>I am very grateful to the respective authors of these plugins because it’s amazing to see how a community (such as the Wordpress one) can make amazing products that are so functional. I’ve enjoyed hacking around and making them do what I want them to do, but this is by no means an end to configuring my blog exactly how I want it. This is just a snapshot of my blog.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/car-salesmen-definitely-earn-their-reputation/"> Car Salesmen Definitely Earn Their Reputation </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 25</span> <p>Do you like car salesmen? I don’t.</p> <p>They’re pushy, they’re slightly overbearing, and they only want to be your friends to make money off of you.</p> <p>Case in point:</p> <p>I read an article about an incident that outraged me. It also solidified my distaste for car salesmen. In the May 2007 edition of <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/">Car and Driver</a> magazine, I saw an article about a man who went into a dealership to buy a car. He ended up buying a GMC Canyon. This man was mentally disabled (he was later reported to have had feces-covered pants on) with a reported IQ (from a relative) of 70.</p> <p>To buy the Canyon, the man paid in cash (approximately $30,000) and ended up telling the salesman that he actually had a lot more cash at home. Granted this isn’t exactly a wise thing to do, but this man was also understandably mentally disabled.</p> <p>Events proceeded and the man one day thought that his truck had been stolen (when in fact it turned out to have been towed). He called up his salesman buddy for a ride who then took him to the tow yard. While driving him, the other salesmen who had conspired together proceeded to go to the man’s home and steal the money. They ended up leaving with $70,000.</p> <p>The police then came to the house to investigate the crime and upon finding feces throughout the house, had the mentally disabled man committed to an institute. A salesman kindly took the time to go to the institute, get the man to sign over the Canyon to <em>him</em>, and charged him for the time that it took to do so!</p> <p>Subsequently, lawsuits were brought against many of the salesmen, the dealership returned the $100,000 to the man, and some semblance of justice was served.</p> <p>Suffice to say, I am still not impressed with salesmen. <strong>Especially</strong> those of the car variety.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/man-cuts-it-off-in-restaurant/"> Man Cuts It Off In Restaurant </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 24</span> <p>People are ridiculous. It’s amazing. I don’t even need to cut this entry short because I am speechless at such an act. Imagine yourself out eating dinner at a nice place. Then a man runs in. And then that man proceeds to storm a kitchen, grab a knife, and cut himself. Even more shockingly, he cuts off his own penis. Are you kidding me?!</p> <p>If you’d like, you can read <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6586879.stm">the original article</a>. Seen <a href="http://digg.com/world_news/Man_cuts_off_penis_in_restaurant_2">on Digg</a>.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/passport-pictures/"> Passport Pictures </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 24</span> <p>Have you found that it’s fairly ridiculous how much people will charge you when you absolutely need something? Take passport pictures for example. There are specifications and guidelines such that most people won’t really want to study them in order to make their own pictures. So because of that, they’ll gladly just pay someone 8 bucks (or whatever it is) for a couple of 2” x 2” pictures of their face. Outrageous! Good thing you have other options.</p> <p>I wanted to make some passport pictures for <a href="http://redbricks.xanga.com/">someone that I know</a> because she needed more than the usual 2. Because of that, I’m not sure how much it would cost. And on top of that, I always thought it was unfortunate how much places would charge you for passport pictures anyways.</p> <p>So I searched online, and I found <a href="http://www.dpchallenge.com/tutorial.php?TUTORIAL_ID=22">this great tutorial</a> that shows you how to make your own passport pictures! I followed the tutorial, but I used <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">the Gimp</a> instead.</p> <p>The Gimp (Gnu Image Manipulation Program) is an <a href="http://amzn.to/RGY3pA">Adobe Photoshop</a> replacement that is both open-source AND free. That means that all of you cheap suckers out there can use this for nothing instead of that hacked version of Photoshop that you’re currently running (which is illegal both in law and in spirit). It’s also pretty robust in my opinion, but then again I’m not wizard at image manipulation anyways. Anyways, the Gimp has all of the necessary tools available but here are some helpful pointers from a beginner who already has done it. I didn’t want to just put the whole tutorial here because I didn’t make it. If you want to use it, then go there. However, for some completeness the steps are basically:</p> <h3 id="basic-steps">Basic Steps</h3> <ol> <li>Measure from the chin to the top of the head to get the number of pixels.</li> <li>Calculate the DPI (dots per inch) that you’ll need for your particular picture because in the end you’ll need 1-1.375 inches from the chin to the top of the head. <ul> <li>Divide measured pixels from chin to the top of the head by how many inches you want (from 1 to 1.375 inches). That gives you pixels/inches which is the same as DPI.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Do a fixed size select. Since you want a 2” x 2” picture in the end, you’ll have to multiply the DPI that you previously got by 2. So if you calculated a DPI of 530 as in the tutorial, then you would do a fixed size select of 1060 by 1060. Copy the selected area.</li> <li>Create a new file with a size of 4” x 6” (or whatever size you want, I actually made an 8.5” x 11”). Then change the resolution to whatever your DPI is.</li> <li>Paste however many pictures you need from your fixed size selection to the new file. Position them so that you’ll have room to cut them out, etc</li> <li>You’re done!</li> </ol> <h3 id="helpful-hints">Helpful Hints</h3> <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/221/471460304_170c90bfff_o.jpg" alt="measure_tool"/> The measuring tool is located in the toolbox as indicated. It works similarly to the Photoshop tool in the tutorial.</p> <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/170/471460310_ddc25bdc26_o.jpg" alt="fixed_size"/> When using the rectangle select, you don’t have to use the free select. Use the fixed size option as shown here (after doing the calculations in the tutorial).</p> <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/183/471460290_754e33b34b_o.jpg" alt="new_image"/> Make sure to specify the new file in inches according to how you want to print it. Then the resolution should be made to equal your DPI (this makes sure that your picture will turn out to be the right size).</p> <p>Also, not to sound like <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/fanaticism/">a fanatic</a> but long live open source software! :D</p> <p>Update: if you specifically want a U.S. passport picture, the State Department has <a href="http://travel.state.gov/_res/flash/cropper/FIG_cropper.html">this Adobe Flash tool</a>, which is extremely easy to use!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/worth-the-wait/"> Worth The Wait </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 23</span> <p>I want to wait But I don’t know if I can stay strong.
