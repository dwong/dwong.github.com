  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now I don&rsquo;t want to be a sneaky bugger (even though some might say that about me anyways), so I will tell you upfront that I&rsquo;m trying out Google AdSense.</p>

<p>Additionally I have added a site search at the top that will allow you to not only search the web, but it will also allow you to search only my site!  I think that&rsquo;s a fairly useful feature if you were so inclined to wonder about what whether I&rsquo;ve written about a certain topic.</p>

<p>Now why would I add these features?  Well I&rsquo;ll also be honest with you about something else.  I actually don&rsquo;t hardly ever click on ads (even the nice text ads that aren&rsquo;t obnoxious).  But I also have realized that they&rsquo;re not too bad to click on.  It doesn&rsquo;t hurt me to look at an advertisement site (especially when it actually <strong>is</strong> related to what I&rsquo;m looking at).  Anyways so if nothing ever comes of it, then that&rsquo;s fine.  But I figured that I should stop wondering if I could make enough money blogging, and I should just try it out.  Google ads are generally pretty good about finding out about content and delivering meaningful ads.  I can tentatively vouch for that.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have also added a bunch of support buttons to my site.  I think that although they generally detract from the main purpose of the site (which is to post content from my mind), they warrant their place.  Each of these components are either important to the support of this blog or to my personal usage.  They are simply a sign of things that I approve of.  These are totally unrelated to the advertisements that I&rsquo;m trying out, and all are freely available for you to use.</p>

<p>Feedback on these topics as well as on any other topic on this site is always welcome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[pri-<strong>koh</strong>-sh_uh_ s]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>Unusually advanced or mature</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>While the rest of the class was struggling with their work, the precocious child had finished already and was causing a ruckus because he was bored.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This is definitely one of those words that is very descriptive of what you&rsquo;re trying to say.  You can try to explain what you mean with this word in many more words, but this word displays much more brevity.  And that is always good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now passing judgment on people is not always good as we all know.  Of course people nowadays want there to be no judgments whatsoever.  And let&rsquo;s be honest, that doesn&rsquo;t really make any sense at all.  It makes about as much sense as getting rid of the court system, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Well I saw something today, and it is a case that definitely makes me think about some judgment passing.</p>

<p>Now far be it from me to know if someone actually understands what it means to be a Christian.  But I have to wonder about it when I see a sign on the street that proclaims that they should come to church in order to win a car.  They direct you to their website where they have <a href="http://www.ineedarevolution.com/easter/">a page dedicated to their contest</a>.</p>

<p>To me, that seems outlandish where they feel that they have a need to offer people physical prizes in order to attract them to come to their church.  Some out there will say that it&rsquo;s a good thing to get people into church no matter how they got there.  But is that really the right attitude?</p>

<p>Seems ridiculous to me, and I hope that this is not a growing trend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0325710/">The Last Samurai</a> again, I realized some interesting things.  Although Tom Cruise is fairly crazy as of late, this was definitely a good movie.  In this viewing anyways, I thought that it was insightful to see a leader who was willing to join in on the fight.  Contrast this with the leadership style of being perfectly willing to direct form the rear.</p>

<p>In that final scene where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsumoto">Katsumoto</a> (loosely based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigo_Takamori">Saigo Takamori</a>) and Nathan Algren (played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>) lead the final charge against the Imperial Army, you see the contrasting styles where Katsumoto and Algren ride their horses through the enemy while Omura (played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masato_Harada">Masato Harada</a>) stands on the hill helplessly trying to yell out orders for the gunmen to shoot their weapons.  If not for the superior (albeit seemingly cheating) technology that the Imperial Army had, all of the honor rode with the samurai.</p>

<p>Life has its share of similar incidents.  There are those people who are willing to get down and dirty versus those who love to direct others.  It&rsquo;s the basic difference in thinking between those that want something done and those that will just go do it.  Now this is probably a slightly unfair description of the situation because I think that I tend to be of the latter variety most of the time.  And obviously <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/">I must think that I am right</a> about it.  But objectively, those of the other mindset will think that people like me rush into things too quickly and act too impulsively sometimes.  This is all true, but I digress.  (Read <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/">this entry</a> to learn more about what I think)</p>

<p>Now what does this mean?</p>

<blockquote><p>If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s definitely an often heard phrase, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p>Lead by example, not by dictation.  Try it and you will find a spirit of self-reliance that you didn&rsquo;t think possible.  And that is a good thing.</p>

<p>On another note: after a nice reprieve from the world as I know it, I&rsquo;m back rested and with a little tan.  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[<strong>ten</strong>-uh-buh l]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>To be capable of being held or defended</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>That bunker over there is on higher ground, has a good vantage point of the attackers, and is thus definitely tenable.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This word can be used both as meaning to hold an actual place, but more commonly in our day and age it can be used to describe a side of an argument.  When someone has a better position in such an argument, their position could be described as tenable.  If you use it, people might nod and agree, but they&rsquo;ll likely have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.  Then you&rsquo;ll feel like an all-star.  Unless of course they already know what it means, in which case you better make sure that you&rsquo;re using it in the right context.</p>

<blockquote><p>The more uncommon a word is, the more horrible it is when used in the wrong context
-Derek Wong</p></blockquote>

<p>Haha I can&rsquo;t believe that I just made up a quote and then quoted myself.  :P</p>
