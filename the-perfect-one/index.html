<div class="entry-content"><p>Search for anything of substance, and you will find that it is quite easy to start believing that there is only one option that will satisfy.  And even though it is near impossible to tell whether you have exhausted all possibilities in the world, you know that you will immediately recognize that Perfect One.</p>

<p>The Perfect One is the ideal that you have in your mind of whatever it is that you are looking for.  It is going to be recognized and apparent.  You are sure of this.  Far be it from me to doubt that you could possibly know this for sure.</p>

<p>For example when you are dating, you are looking for the Perfect Boyfriend/Girlfriend.  If you are a little better at seeing the bigger picture, you are looking for the Perfect Husband/Wife.  But through the good and bad dates, you are evaluating the other person by holding them up against your ideal.  Once the other person does not match, you are going to move on.  Don&#8217;t pay attention to the fact that the person would make a very good match for you despite being slightly too short.  Much more tragically than missing a good match in search of a perfect match, though, is being married to someone who you eventually believe to not be the perfect match.  When that happens, you might find that you have found the Perfect One in another person.  At the very least in this situation you are going to imagine the possibilities of a different life, and at the worst it can lead you to  pursue your fantasies.  This will obviously hurt many people around in addition to making you a liar (since you could not keep your vows).</p>

<p>Another instance when people look for the Perfect One is when they are house hunting.  When you are searching for a house, people often advise you that you will &#8220;just know&#8221; once you walk into a house.  That is rubbish.  It is just another way of saying that you should be looking for the Perfect House.  Forget the fact that you are looking at houses that would work out just fine.  And forget the fact that any house will have its problems.  Forget the fact that <strong>it&#8217;s just a building</strong> that will not last!</p>

<p>The horrible thing about this mindset is not that you should have standards.  When someone fails to meet your standards for a mate or if a house is completely broken, you <em>should</em> move on.  That just makes sense.  However, the horrible thing about this mindset is that it will fool you into doing things that do not make any sense at all.  You will fall in love with the Perfect One with your heart but not with your head.  And then when (not if) reality comes in the form of imperfections, you will be horribly disappointed.  And it will hurt.</p>

<p>Can this be fixed?  Yes it can!  Today you can realize that there is no perfect one, whatever it is that you are looking for.  Realize that settling can be just a negative take on this and realize that settling is not always so bad.  Settle on something that is acceptable (this seems obvious but don&#8217;t settle on something that is unacceptable).  If you do not settle, then at least start to believe that the Perfect One will never be found.  Move forward with the knowledge that you will NOT find the Perfect One.  And if the results match up to your expectations, you are much less likely to get into trouble.</p>
