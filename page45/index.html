But in reality, money is a fairly simple concept that seems to get muddled and complicated because people have such a vested interest in it. And because analysts want to keep their job of explaining the complex to the uneducated.</p> <p>Basically you earn money (or you find it, or you steal it, or whatever) so that is what is coming in, and then you spend it (or you give it away, or you lose it, you know) and that is what is going out. So what’s the best thing to do? Well spend less than you earn and you should do right fine. Makes sense huh?</p> <p>A while ago I read about a basic rule for which one could ideally budget and limit one’s spending. It’s called the 40-30-20-10 rule for obvious reasons. The very quick among you would have already realized that those numbers add up to 100 and that would seem to represent 100% of your income. So what do the rest of the numbers represent?</p> <ul> <li> <p>40 - Savings</p> </li> <li> <p>30 - Necessary spending such as rent, food, bills, etc</p> </li> <li> <p>20 - Free expenditure allowing any possibility of spending on entertainment, gifts, and otherwise unnecessary for living types of things</p> </li> <li> <p>10 - Tithe</p> </li> </ul> <p>When I first read that, it seemed pretty easy and straightforward to me! However, I am wondering if it’s too easy to look at on paper but perhaps a bit too difficult in reality. How many people do you know who only live on 30% of their income? It sounds extremely conservative doesn’t it? You’d require a much better income just to be living an average lifestyle. Of course, I think that’s kind of the point of this budgeting scheme. However, I honestly don’t think that too many people could adhere to this type of drastic budgeting change from their own methods because they have come to expect a level of “luxury” in their lives.</p> <p>I think that this is a superb idea, and I will try to stick with it as much as I can. I’ve been working on <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/the-budgeteer/">The Budgeteer</a> (although that’s not what this post is really about), and I’ve been using this budgeting as my budgeting inputs. It’s been going alright thus far, and I actually have personally increased my savings category since my necessary expenditures are currently not as high. It’s nice, but I’m wondering if it’ll always be so.</p> <p>Have many people heard of this plan? Would/could/will many practically use it?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/get-me-out-of-here/"> Get Me Out Of Here </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 30</span> <p>Alright alright, that was a lame title considering what it’s about. This is just to note that I just hacked a couple of my plugins so that they don’t display me or my information anymore.</p> <p>For example, in the recent comments in the sidebar, it was showing my comments, but I have removed that so that now it will only show comments by people other than me.</p> <p>And then for the Stats page that is displayed, I have decided to only let it show information that is unrelated to me. Hopefully that will give some better statistics for you to see on what is actually popular with other people rather than just with me!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/sneezing-coughingkeep-it-to-yourself/"> Sneezing, Coughing...Keep It To Yourself! </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 28</span> <p>This past weekend was quite an ordeal. I saw many instances of disgusting behavior that even more solidified my belief that people are just gross. Is it because I live in a fastidious society that elevates cleanliness to godliness? Perhaps it is. But it doesn’t matter because I am still grossed out by others no matter what the reason.</p> <p>Sneezing is a naturally occurring action. Our body responds like that because it is trying to rid itself of something that does not belong. Perhaps it is because we are sick and it’s trying to expel some germ-infested mucus. Or more than likely it is because there is some dust or other foreign particle caught inside of our body. So the body is doing a great thing when it reacts with a sneeze. However, there is no need to be at a swap meet and turn to the side to sneeze. The reason that there is no need for that is because there might be other people standing near there. And those people might not appreciate your nasty disgusting expelled mucus even close to them. Thanks.</p> <p>Coughing is a similarly outstanding action that the body uses to save itself from harm. It can happen in order to keep the windpipe clear so that we can breathe. Well I guess it can also happen in order to signal someone about something. But that is not what I’m thinking of. I’m thinking of that hacking repeated cough that some are so inclined to do. You know where you don’t do that? At a buffet. A place where everyone essentially shares the same food. You don’t cough on your hand. You know why? It’s because you are going to use that same hand to get your food. That is sick. You also do not sneeze all over food. It doesn’t matter if you don’t like it. It doesn’t matter what you’re doing. You can feel it (it doesn’t sneak up on you) so please just put anything in your hand down so that you can cover up. That is even more sick! I hope that you don’t know what you are doing and what germs are because if you knew and still did it, you should be so ashamed.</p> <p>I do not appreciate when people are inconsiderate. Have you ever noticed how easy it is for us (in general as people) to truly only care about ourselves? It’s our natural carnal tendency, whether you’d like to admit it or not. Some acknowledge this and try their darnedest to fight it. Some have been changed. And some just don’t care. I’d hope that I’m not the latter ranting and raving against my own.</p> <p>So next time you cough, sneeze, or in some other way do something that can affect others, think about what you’d want others to do. And put some hand sanitizer on that mess.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/tkinter-keyboard-bindings-in-python/"> Tkinter Keyboard Bindings (In Python) </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 24</span> <p>So I found this table useful, and I thought that I’d make it available for easier searching for those who might also look for it. It’s useful when creating a GUI with Tkinter in Python. I’m not really sure how much of that kind of development is going on, of course, but that’s beside the point.</p> <p>Anyways this is specific to the “special keys” that are used in the bind method for event handling, so I’ve not looked into where else this particular information could be useful. I, for one, used this in order to bind the enter key on the keypad to the same functions as the normal enter button. It was annoying me while using <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/the-budgeteer/">The Budgeteer</a> because I couldn’t figure out what the name of the button to bind was. That has thankfully been remedied!</p> <p>Example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">root = Tk() def hello(*ignore): print 'Hello World' root.bind('&lt;return&gt;', hello) root.mainloop() </code></p> <p>.keysym.keycode.keysym_numKey</p> <p>Alt_L 64 65513 The left-hand alt key</p> <p>Alt_R 113 65514 The right-hand alt key</p> <p>BackSpace 22 65288 backspace</p> <p>Cancel 110 65387 break</p> <p>Caps_Lock 66 65549 CapsLock</p> <p>Control_L 37 65507 The left-hand control key</p> <p>Control_R 109 65508 The right-hand control key</p> <p>Delete 107 65535 Delete</p> <p>Down 104 65364 ↓</p> <p>End 103 65367 end</p> <p>Escape 9 65307 esc</p> <p>Execute 111 65378 SysReq</p> <p>F1 67 65470 Function key F1</p> <p>F2 68 65471 Function key F2</p> <p>Fi 66+i 65469+i Function key Fi</p> <p>F12 96 65481 Function key F12</p> <p>Home 97 65360 home</p> <p>Insert 106 65379 insert</p> <p>Left 100 65361 ←</p> <p>Linefeed 54 106 Linefeed (control-J)</p> <p>KP_0 90 65438 0 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_1 87 65436 1 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_2 88 65433 2 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_3 89 65435 3 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_4 83 65430 4 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_5 84 65437 5 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_6 85 65432 6 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_7 79 65429 7 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_8 80 65431 8 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_9 81 65434 9 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Add 86 65451 + on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Begin 84 65437 The center key (same key as 5) on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Decimal 91 65439 Decimal (.) on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Delete 91 65439 delete on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Divide 112 65455 ↓ on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Down 88 65433 on the keypad</p> <p>KP_End 87 65436 end on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Enter 108 65421 enter on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Home 79 65429 home on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Insert 90 65438 insert on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Left 83 65430 ← on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Multiply 63 65450 * on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Next 89 65435 PageDown on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Prior 81 65434 PageUp on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Right 85 65432 → on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Subtract 82 65453 - on the keypad</p> <p>KP_Up 80 65431 ↑ on the keypad</p> <p>Next 105 65366 PageDown</p> <p>Num_Lock 77 65407 NumLock</p> <p>Pause 110 65299 pause</p> <p>Print 111 65377 PrintScrn</p> <p>Prior 99 65365 PageUp</p> <p>Return 36 652933 The enter key (control-M).

It’s a real short one in which you describe yourself using a template of 7 words that start with the letter ‘P’. All you do is fill it out, link back to whoever tagged you and then tag others. I don’t do these things all that often, but it’s nice to be thought of so I’ll give it a go.</p> <p>Passion - God, family, friends, fun Purpose - Much more than the average joe Pursuit - A life that is in line with what I believe Position - Sitting. Always sitting. Pummeling - Rude drivers. Pummeling is a funny word to use here. Progress - Doing alright, doing alright. Not doing so well on not repeating myself, though Personality - Honest, realistic, slightly sarcastic</p> <p>Usually you’re supposed to tag people, but I think that I’m just going to leave this open-ended. If you want to do it, go for it and let me know!
