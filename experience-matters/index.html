Those who can’t – teach. -H.L. Mencken</p> </blockquote> <p>An oft heard saying that strikes deep at the hearts of every teacher around. It’s not hard to find a pupil or person who is willing to use the saying for someone that they are forced to listen to. While I don’t often say it (seems rather blatantly disrespectful, wouldn’t you say?), sometimes I can see where the quote might have come from.</p> <p>Have you met people that freely give their opinion on anything that they encounter? Yeah that person is called a know-it-all. They’re a KIA. Without the 10 year/100,000 mile warranty. Hardy har har. But they really are a pet peeve of mine. Most people aren’t fond of KIAs however when I encounter one I have this immense urge to prove them wrong.</p> <p>KIAs are a proud and arrogant bunch who at their core probably are a little unsure of themselves. And thus the need to prove their superiority over everyone else.</p> <p>I would like to make the distinction at this point between those that think that they know it all as opposed to those that actually do know quite a bit. KIAs are those that think that they know it all. But they don’t. While they have an opinion on everything, you only need to be well-versed in one of the things that they talk about to know that they don’t know as much as it might seem. However, there really are people that know their stuff. And to them I say bravo. It’s funny how those that actually know a lot seem to think that they know so little while those that know very little seem to feign knowing much, huh?</p> <p>Anyway, so that point is that I don’t like listening to people give me their opinion on something that I’m doing when they have no experience in the matter themselves. If they have no experience, then they obviously do not entirely know what they are talking about. It’s even worse when I know that they don’t even have the capacity for it.</p> <p>Take exercising for example. While I’m not an amazing athlete or anything, it’s hard to listen to those who’ve never run a mile give their advice on my running. To someone who will not even raise a finger for their own well-being, you do not get to sit on the sideline and critique my effort.</p> <p>I give brownie points for trying your best. Perseverance is not something to be taken lightly. But if you’re not even willing to give it a shot? You might as well be talking to a wall. At least it won’t try to prove you wrong!</p> </div> <section> <div id="amzn-assoc-ad-9cfbbbe0-6312-4668-bbea-0252c5c9265a"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=9cfbbbe0-6312-4668-bbea-0252c5c9265a"></script> </section> <section> <h1>Comments</h1> <div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </section> <div class="related"> <h2>Related Posts</h2> <ul class="related-posts"> <li> <h3> <a href="/bingo-number-generator/"> Bingo Number Generator <small>Feb 4</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/grand-canyon/"> Grand Canyon <small>Mar 10</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/change-2005-toyota-tacoma-manual-transmission-shifter-bushing/"> Change 2005 Toyota Tacoma Manual Transmission Shifter Seat And Bushing <small>Feb 8</small> </a> </h3> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/embed.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
