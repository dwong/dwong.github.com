<div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Those who can &ndash; do. Those who can&rsquo;t &ndash; teach.
-H.L. Mencken</p></blockquote>

<p>An oft heard saying that strikes deep at the hearts of every teacher around.  It&rsquo;s not hard to find a pupil or person who is willing to use the saying for someone that they are forced to listen to.  While I don&rsquo;t often say it (seems rather blatantly disrespectful, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?), sometimes I can see where the quote might have come from.</p>

<p>Have you met people that freely give their opinion on anything that they encounter?  Yeah that person is called a know-it-all.  They&rsquo;re a KIA.  Without the 10 year/100,000 mile warranty.  Hardy har har.  But they really are a pet peeve of mine.  Most people aren&rsquo;t fond of KIAs however when I encounter one I have this immense urge to prove them wrong.</p>

<p>KIAs are a proud and arrogant bunch who at their core probably are a little unsure of themselves.  And thus the need to prove their superiority over everyone else.</p>

<p>I would like to make the distinction at this point between those that think that they know it all as opposed to those that actually do know quite a bit.  KIAs are those that think that they know it all.  But they don&rsquo;t.  While they have an opinion on everything, you only need to be well-versed in one of the things that they talk about to know that they don&rsquo;t know as much as it might seem.  However, there really are people that know their stuff.  And to them I say bravo.  It&rsquo;s funny how those that actually know a lot seem to think that they know so little while those that know very little seem to feign knowing much, huh?</p>

<p>Anyway, so that point is that I don&rsquo;t like listening to people give me their opinion on something that I&rsquo;m doing when they have no experience in the matter themselves.  If they have no experience, then they obviously do not entirely know what they are talking about.  It&rsquo;s even worse when I know that they don&rsquo;t even have the capacity for it.</p>

<p>Take exercising for example.  While I&rsquo;m not an amazing athlete or anything, it&rsquo;s hard to listen to those who&rsquo;ve never run a mile give their advice on my running.  To someone who will not even raise a finger for their own well-being, you do not get to sit on the sideline and critique my effort.</p>

<p>I give brownie points for trying your best.  Perseverance is not something to be taken lightly.  But if you&rsquo;re not even willing to give it a shot?  You might as well be talking to a wall.  At least it won&rsquo;t try to prove you wrong!</p>
