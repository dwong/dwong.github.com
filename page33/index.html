  <div class="entry-content"><p>A touch
And&hellip;ah relief
But where did the precious item go?
It&rsquo;s probably at my feet</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not there
I heard a tinkle, a sound of hard items contacting
But it&rsquo;s not there
Not where I&rsquo;d expect it</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on my knees
Begging, hoping, almost praying
When will I know?</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m searching far and wide
In the depths of despair
Amidst the trash and the disgusting
Nobody should need to look at this stuff, let alone touch it
But it&rsquo;s worth it</p>

<p>Who will accept it?
When will I be satisfied?
When will I know the secrets that I want to know?
Ah this is so much trouble
I want to rest
I give up</p>

<p>Oh.
There it is right under my nose!
Well, not quite <em>right</em> under
More like a little to the right&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We, as people, have a love/hate relationship with one of the things that is constantly changing: our age.  Sometimes we want to get older, and sometimes we will do everything that we can to reduce it.  But we really have no control over it, do we?</p>

<p>It seems as if all of this starts early in life.  As we are going through the different grades in school, there is a marked distinction between students who are in different grades.  Granted, this is all rather necessary because children generally mature and progress according to how old they are.  So it makes sense in that situation.  But the lasting influence seems to be that we feel comfortable with <em>just</em> people our own age.</p>

<h3>Relationships</h3>

<p>This effect can often be seen in the arena of relationships.  Why is it that many of my friends who are girls will not even think about dating a younger guy?  Is it because younger guys is not be great and worthy of her?  Is it because they (the girls) are somehow more mature because they are a couple of years (sometimes a couple of months) older?  I doubt it.  Why do my guy friends only look for girls that are younger than them?  And why is there a floor limit such that they won&rsquo;t even consider girls younger than their specified age?  There are a lot of questions, and there aren&rsquo;t that many answers.  All I know is that it all doesn&rsquo;t make much sense.  People limit themselves by not looking for the things that really matter, the essence and characteristics of a person.  Then they complain that they can&rsquo;t find anyone.  And that&rsquo;s just not right, is it?</p>

<h3>Social Aspects</h3>

<p>People age.  That&rsquo;s the truth.  And it seems like as that happens the reality of death is more apparent.  The chances become greater (on any particular day since the actual chances that you will die are 100%), and that seems to have lend itself to the general notion that young is better.  Even more than that unspoken tendency is that socially we have come to praise the young as vibrant and beautiful.</p>

<p>On the other hand, people who are getting older can always attest that they are getting wiser.  It&rsquo;s true, they should be getting wiser anyways.  They just have more experience, and those with experience know that it counts.  Of course, those who lack it do not think that it counts for very much.  I know, I&rsquo;ve been/am still there.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>But I say that it&rsquo;s so much more important to be young at heart.  Of people that I&rsquo;ve met, young and old, I find myself consistently being convinced that being young at heart is truly the way that I want to go.  I don&rsquo;t want to lose the awe of a child looking at the huge expanse of the night sky or discovering something for the first time.  No amount of time or social constructs can take <em>that</em> away.  Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t be proud of your age sheerly because of your age.  That would make you <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/01/13/proud-of-nothing/">Proud Of Nothing</a>, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>So really there are 2 ways that you can deal with age:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Wine</strong> - get tastier and more valuable with age</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cheese</strong> - get moldy!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Haha I know, I&rsquo;m just good at making up strikingly accurate analogies.  You don&rsquo;t need to tell me twice.  No really, you don&rsquo;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So this past weekend, I got the privilege of being in a wedding party for the first time.  And I must say, it was quite nice!</p>

<p>I wanted to write this down partly for myself, just so that I can remember it all.</p>

<p>Starting the day before the rehearsal some of the groomsmen hung out with Daniel, the groom.  It wasn&rsquo;t too outrageous at all.</p>

<p>Then the day of the rehearsal (the day before the actual wedding) was quite busy.  Rental car, drove up ~60 miles to the church (in LA) for the rehearsal.  Got there in time (even with workday traffic).  Fun rehearsal!  For some reason it seemed pretty amusing.  (Oh and I might have tested out the sanctuary to see how my laugh would echo.  And other people might have told me to not dare laugh the day of the wedding.  :P)  Rehearsal lunch.  Food was good, and the conversation was fairly flowing.  Hotel.  The hotel messed up.  Unhappiness.  Ah oh well.  Go-karts.  Better at it than I thought.  (I guess that even though I can rant <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/27/on-driving/">On Driving</a>, I might very well have an aggressive driver in me!)  Got 2nd out of our group (thanks a lot Mike haha).  Hm where is my trophy?
Dinner with Daniel&rsquo;s family.  Late, but it worked out.  Sat with some of his extended family and another groomsman.  Got to hear about New Mexican food and their amazing miracle chili sauce.  (I&rsquo;ve never tried it, but I&rsquo;d be very willing at this point!)  Hotel.  Get ready for sleep.  Gifts from groom.  Talk.  Sleep.</p>

<p>Up at 6:30 AM (it was a 10:30 AM wedding) to get ready.  Out of the hotel by 8 AM.  Do random stuff at the church and sit around looking good for a couple of hours.  Walk down the aisle.  Stand.  Stand.  Feet hurt.  Stand.  And done!  Get out of there, help with more random stuff.  Reception.  Kiss kiss.  See old friends from college.  Nice.  Good lunch.  Real nice.  Slideshow.  Oh sweet they put me in it more than once.  Drive back down to pick up my car from the groom&rsquo;s place, and that&rsquo;s a wrap!</p>

<p>I enjoyed my time being a part of their wedding.  I&rsquo;m glad that I at least got to be in one!  Haha I think that I&rsquo;m probably good in terms of wedding experiences.  That is I don&rsquo;t need to be a part of another one.  Except as groom.  That&rsquo;s one experience that I&rsquo;m pretty positive that I want!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remembering something is usually a case of you did or you didn&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;ve often found it amusing for things like birthdays when people will say that they remembered, but they just didn&rsquo;t say anything about it.  Really&hellip;well that&rsquo;s hard to imagine.</p>

<p>The thing is, some people have better memories than others.  Everyone is different and is able to remember things in different ways.  Laugh if you must, but I remember wanting a photographic memory like Cam Jansen when I was a kid.  Then I could rapidly flip through books and not need to study!  How wonderful that would have been!  But alas, my dreams did not come true.  Even now I often wish for a better memory.</p>

<p>But just as remembering something is pretty binary (i.e. you did or you didn&rsquo;t), those of us lacking in the memory department have to make do with what we have.  Otherwise we will be mocked.  Who will mock, I do not know.  All I know is that mocking will occur.</p>

<h4>3 Memory Aids That I Use:</h4>

<ol>
<li><h5>Remember The Milk</h5></li>
</ol>


<p>(RTM for short)</p>

<p>Besides having a pretty amusing name, this is a website whose sole purpose is to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_%28computer_programming%29#Tags">TODO</a> lists.  It&rsquo;s refreshing for a website to be so singular in its purpose in this day of do-everything-until-we-take-over-your-life websites.  In any case, I initially signed up for an account on the site, thought it was cool, and promptly did not hardly ever use it because visiting another site everyday wasn&rsquo;t too practical.</p>

<p>But then they developed a <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox">Firefox</a> extension that changed that up!  They developed an extension for placing an RTM pane whenever a Gmail tab is opened!  It maintains the overall look and feel of gmail so you (or at least I) don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s out of place at all.  Since I much more often have a browser tab open for Gmail, I was much more able to use the service.  And I have.  And it&rsquo;s great!</p>

<p>The concept is nothing new, you just put in due dates.  But since it&rsquo;s in front of my face at least once a day (since I check my e-mail once a day), it&rsquo;s actually useful.  And it&rsquo;s on a remote server so I don&rsquo;t need to worry about losing it or keeping different lists in sync.</p>

<p>So there are 2 ways to use this baby:</p>

<pre><code>* [Gmail for RTM extension](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/gmail/)


* [RTM website](http://www.rememberthemilk.com)
</code></pre>

<p>Either will do, just do.</p>

<ol>
<li><h5>Phone calendar</h5></li>
</ol>


<p>Okay so I don&rsquo;t have a smart phone.  But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that my phone is dumb!  (Ha&hellip;ha&hellip;)</p>

<p>But almost all phones nowadays have some sort of calendar feature.  And that&rsquo;s fine and dandy for checking what the date is.  But there is often also the ability to schedule events.  So I use my phone (a Motorola, by the way) and put in reminders for certain things that I need to get done.</p>

<p>This is especially useful when I&rsquo;m out and about.  Often my phone is one of the few things that I&rsquo;ll carry with me.  I could actually text message a reminder to RTM which is cool.  But I&rsquo;ll be honest, I&rsquo;m cheap when it comes to text messaging.  And Verizon charges $.15 per message.  For the amount of reminders that I put in for myself, that could get pricey.  Haha laugh if you want, but the calendar reminders are free.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h5>Google Calendar</h5>

<p>Calendars have been around for ages.  The print versions are still quite popular and understandably so.  But as computer usage becomes more and more prevalent, we are transferring much of the things that we do in tangible form to things that we can do through using the computer.</p>

<p>Personally I use the Google calendar, but really there are many such applications floating around.  I figure that I already have a Gmail account, so why not.  (Of course, this line of reasoning sounds that in my post <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/10/22/googles-taking-over-the-worldand-i-dont-like-it/">Google&rsquo;s Taking Over The World&hellip;And I Don&rsquo;t Like It</a>.)</p>

<p>Anyways, a nice feature of Google calendar is that I can have it e-mail me before the event occurs.  I don&rsquo;t use the application everyday, but awhile back I input all of my friends&#8217; birthdays.  Now it will e-mail me the day before someone&rsquo;s birthday, so I&rsquo;ll never egregiously forget a friend&rsquo;s birthday!</p>

<p>Granted, it&rsquo;d be better if I just remembered.  It would show that I care more.  It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t care.  It&rsquo;s just that I don&rsquo;t want to make a mistake!  It&rsquo;s my failsafe, if you will.</p>
