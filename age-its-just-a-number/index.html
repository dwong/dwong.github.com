<div class="entry-content"><p>We, as people, have a love/hate relationship with one of the things that is constantly changing: our age.  Sometimes we want to get older, and sometimes we will do everything that we can to reduce it.  But we really have no control over it, do we?</p>

<p>It seems as if all of this starts early in life.  As we are going through the different grades in school, there is a marked distinction between students who are in different grades.  Granted, this is all rather necessary because children generally mature and progress according to how old they are.  So it makes sense in that situation.  But the lasting influence seems to be that we feel comfortable with <em>just</em> people our own age.</p>

<h3>Relationships</h3>

<p>This effect can often be seen in the arena of relationships.  Why is it that many of my friends who are girls will not even think about dating a younger guy?  Is it because younger guys is not be great and worthy of her?  Is it because they (the girls) are somehow more mature because they are a couple of years (sometimes a couple of months) older?  I doubt it.  Why do my guy friends only look for girls that are younger than them?  And why is there a floor limit such that they won&rsquo;t even consider girls younger than their specified age?  There are a lot of questions, and there aren&rsquo;t that many answers.  All I know is that it all doesn&rsquo;t make much sense.  People limit themselves by not looking for the things that really matter, the essence and characteristics of a person.  Then they complain that they can&rsquo;t find anyone.  And that&rsquo;s just not right, is it?</p>

<h3>Social Aspects</h3>

<p>People age.  That&rsquo;s the truth.  And it seems like as that happens the reality of death is more apparent.  The chances become greater (on any particular day since the actual chances that you will die are 100%), and that seems to have lend itself to the general notion that young is better.  Even more than that unspoken tendency is that socially we have come to praise the young as vibrant and beautiful.</p>

<p>On the other hand, people who are getting older can always attest that they are getting wiser.  It&rsquo;s true, they should be getting wiser anyways.  They just have more experience, and those with experience know that it counts.  Of course, those who lack it do not think that it counts for very much.  I know, I&rsquo;ve been/am still there.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>But I say that it&rsquo;s so much more important to be young at heart.  Of people that I&rsquo;ve met, young and old, I find myself consistently being convinced that being young at heart is truly the way that I want to go.  I don&rsquo;t want to lose the awe of a child looking at the huge expanse of the night sky or discovering something for the first time.  No amount of time or social constructs can take <em>that</em> away.  Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t be proud of your age sheerly because of your age.  That would make you <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/01/13/proud-of-nothing/">Proud Of Nothing</a>, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>So really there are 2 ways that you can deal with age:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Wine</strong> &ndash; get tastier and more valuable with age</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Cheese</strong> &ndash; get moldy!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Haha I know, I&rsquo;m just good at making up strikingly accurate analogies.  You don&rsquo;t need to tell me twice.  No really, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
