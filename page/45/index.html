  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1126/548495930_e714338645_o.jpg" alt="Summer photo CC by flickr user Storm Crypt" />I was never one for pro con lists. But maybe I&#8217;ll start. Here is one for the season that is summer. And one caveat to this post is that must know that I live in sunny southern California, so if you live in some forsaken place then you&#8217;ll just have to wish it were different for you. Or you can bask in the cons that I experience and enjoy your freezing cold. Just know this: I wouldn&#8217;t trade places with you at all.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>The sun gives us vitamin D which is needed for, among other things, calcium to be absorbed and used. It also gives you a nice healthy looking glow.
<strong>Con:</strong>The sun causes skin cancer. It also causes wrinkles.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Can make use of those expensive sunglasses.
<strong>Con:</strong>The reflection off of objects is sometimes glaring, especially if we forget to bring those expensive sunglasses.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Have more sunlight to play with (or in).
<strong>Con:</strong>Having nobody to play with.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Summer love.
<strong>Con:</strong>Not having anyone to love. Or more likely, having nobody to love you back.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Sitting out, enjoying a nice drink on the proverbial porch.
<strong>Con:</strong>The stupid bugs that will eat you alive.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Vacations to far off places.
<strong>Con:</strong>Not having any vacation time. Or having no job and plenty of &#8220;vacation time,&#8221; but obviously having no money to vacation with.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Cruising in your car, looking cool.
<strong>Con:</strong>Not having had any rain for a long time, so your car is dirty. Your speakers are not loud enough to make anyone glance again. Your car is laughably unimpressive. You look like a fool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I enjoy open source applications for a number of reasons.  And they don&#8217;t really relate to the fact that I program.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They are free.  How could you want to pay for software when you can have it <strong>legally</strong> for free?</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s more agile (updated more quickly) in general.</p></li>
<li><p>It supports freedom and the opportunity for anyone to get into the software market simply by having a good product.</p></li>
<li><p>They are built by a community that by definition is giving and supportive.</p></li>
<li><p>If I wanted to, I could try to understand the code on my own.  Now, I don&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t exactly have all of the time in the world to understand the source code of applications that are extremely complicated (why would I be using them if they weren&#8217;t complicated).  Nevertheless it&#8217;s rather comforting to know that I could.  :P</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyways, enough of why I like them.  Here are some of my favorites!</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Firefox</a> - the now ubiquitous web browser has come out of the open sourcing of the Netscape Navigator.  It is a &#8220;modern&#8221; web browser with pretty much full support for web standards.  Plus I love the extensions that you can add on at will.  Someday I&#8217;ll write a post of my favorite extensions.  But in any case, it&#8217;s standards-compliant, customizable, and supported by a huge community of developers and testers.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a> - an awesome replacement suite for your office needs.  It has all of the programs that you would need if you&#8217;re a Microsoft Office user.  It supports more formats than MS Office does, and it is instantly easy to use for anyone who has used any office productivity program.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">AmaroK</a> - this is an awesome music player.  The only drawback is that it&#8217;s only available on Linux.  It is an iTunes-like player with integration with a myriad of services including automatic lyric retrieval, last.fm synchronization, and wikipedia integration for information about the artist that you&#8217;re currently listening to!  They&#8217;re starting work on porting this application to other systems, but this would be a huge incentive for any music lover to go to linux.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC media player</a> - plays pretty much any format of media that you can throw at it (with the exception of the closed Real media).  It&#8217;s lightweight and it is on any platform that you could have!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://pidgin.im/pidgin/home/">Pidgin</a> - recently renamed from GAIM because of a settlement, this is an instant messaging program that supports lots of different protocols out there.  And that means that you can replace all of your chatting programs with this single program.  Its looks are similar to other projects, but it surpasses them in features.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> - the Gnu Image Manipulation Project is a full-featured replacement for your image editing needs.  It can even help you <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/24/passport-pictures/">make your own passport pictures</a>.  Photoshop is ridiculously expensive.  People always cheat and install illegal copies.  This is a great replacement for pretty much everyone out there.  You can even make it look like Photoshop with <a href="http://plasticbugs.com/?page_id=294">Gimpshop</a>!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> - this platform is obviously getting more and more recognition.  I could have stated that I like Linux, but I do in fact just use Ubuntu.  There is a huge community, and it&#8217;s growing quickly.  It is a really easy operating system to use (familiar enough for anyone who has previously used an operating system) with some very good hardware support.  It plays nice with older hardware (the server that this blog is currently hosted on was originally running Windows 98, but now runs quite nicely on Ubuntu).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://apache.org/">Apache</a> - on that note, the Apache software foundation is making some really awesome server software.  It powers quite a lot of the Internet.  It&#8217;s easy to set up and there is lots and lots of documentation out there for its use.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I guess that was basically split up with the top half being the more &#8220;usable&#8221; programs that everyone would want to use while the end was geared more towards specialized uses.  Nevertheless, I think that everyone out there could stand to try out the products coming out of these software projects.  Even if you decide to use your commercial program (which is not a problem if it&#8217;s better and more for what you need) then that&#8217;s fine.  But for lots of people, especially those with illegal software, you might want to try out these programs.  And then you should read <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/14/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid/">Music Piracy Makes People Stupid</a> for a longer post about why I think that cheating, stealing, etc is so despicable.  And then you should own up, repent, and go sit in the corner.  We can all sit there together while we think about what we&#8217;ve done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve made a <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/sitemap.xml">sitemap</a> (which is, if the name doesn&#8217;t already indicate, a map of this entire website).  It includes links to every page available on my site!  The purpose of this is to allow search engine &#8216;bots (computers that &#8220;crawl&#8221; through the Internet so that pages can be found through their search engine) to be aware of all of my pages.  I&#8217;m using the <a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/redir/sitemap-home/">Google Sitemaps plugin</a> which will automatically update the sitemap every time I update or create a post.  I&#8217;m also using the <a href="http://www.dicontas.co.uk/blog/google-sitemap-utw-tag-wordpress-plugin/">Google Sitemap - append Tags plugin</a> in order to add the tag pages (where you can see all of the posts with that a tag) to the sitemap.</p>

<p>I think that it&#8217;s cool, although I&#8217;m looking for a better way to order it.  It seems like it should be ordered based on the number of comments because that&#8217;s what I set the option for.</p>

<p>Hmm I just installed the <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2005/07/27/popularity-contest-11/">Popularity Contest plugin</a> to see if I could use that in order to calculate how to order the sitemap.</p>

<p>And now I just easily set it to calculate the priority based on the Popularity Contest plugin!  It uses a priority that is calculated using view count, comments, pingbacks (links to), etc.  I also just realized that the sitemap is just ordered by having the most recently changed posts at the top.  I suppose that this makes some sense since it is for updating the index of the &#8216;bot that is crawling it.  There is no sense in updating the index of a page that is unchanged.</p>

<p>Okay so basically, now you can browse through and check out posts based on their priority.  I just recently made a <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/favorite-posts/">Favorite Posts</a> page, but I&#8217;m not sure if I should still keep it.  Feedback, as usual, is welcome!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[pan-<strong>dem</strong>-ik]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>To be widespread or pervasive (often referring to a disease) over a very large area</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>As the world fell further into turmoil, the already pandemic fear of war grew in intensity.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>Using this word conveys much more meaning than simply using &#8220;very widespread&#8221; because it it speaks of just how extensive it is.  Often it is used in reference to the entire world because the Greek prefix &#8220;pan&#8221; actually means &#8220;all.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1182/536501267_8897fd1b1f_m.jpg" alt="facebehindtheblog" />I was tagged for the Face Behind The Blog meme by Rory of hamelife.com. I enjoyed reading his, and I realize now that people might enjoy one that I did as well. I must admit that when I stopped to think, I realized that I actually had not put any pictures of myself on this blog. I am some anonymous (presumably) Asian male who writes for this blog. Well well well that&#8217;s interesting. So here we go!</p>

<p>I thought that I&#8217;d post pictures marking periods of change in my life. Oh and sorry that the quality is not very good. It was partly because I don&#8217;t have a quality scanner to get those prints that are only in hard form, and it is also partly on purpose because I don&#8217;t want high quality pictures of me floating around on the Internet. You never know what incriminating things people can do to you. ;-)</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1143/537843608_d7d9d09650_m.jpg" alt="glasses" />
Ah young Derek, eagerly awaiting his birthday cake. I believe it was an ice cream pie. Those are good, indeed. Notice the obscenely large glasses. I believe the proper term for me back then was baller. :P</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1210/537843606_854ee8523d.jpg" alt="before_braces" />
This was taken right before I got braces to fix those horrendous canine teeth. <del>bicuspids. (That would be the canine teeth if you didn&#8217;t know.)</del> I had fun during that time but boy did those canine teeth <del>bicuspids</del> cut my lips!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1061/537843610_f549cce98e_m.jpg" alt="high_school" />
A pictures of myself from high school. Thus marked the end of my strange (for the most part) days. This was taken sometime in the middle of high school. I didn&#8217;t like that time period in my life. But the pictures weren&#8217;t bad.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1080/537843614_1c2ea46538.jpg" alt="in_china" />
Here I am in China, and it is the most recent of the bunch. As you can see, I&#8217;m a much more interesting fellow. I&#8217;d like to think that I&#8217;ve come into my own and am comfortable in my own skin. :D Also notice the advent of the digital camera. Splendid!</p>

<p>So in continuing with this fun game, I&#8217;d like to tag Shelly at This Eclectic Life, Mat at matkishimoto&#8217;s blogspot, Ms. Q at qmusings, and HMTKSteve (strangely enough I don&#8217;t know if his name is actually Steve :P) at Ramblings of the Marginalized. You are by no means obliged to do this. I just thought that these would be some interesting people to see what kind of &#8220;different&#8221; pictures they could put up of themselves.</p>
