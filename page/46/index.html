  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seem to talk about advertising a lot.  Anyways, I was listening to radio one morning (I forgot which specific station it was).  I actually laughed out loud when I heard a commercial for a store in Monrovia called <a href="http://home.flash.net/~bras/">Creative Woman - The Wizard of Bras</a>.  Wizard of Bras!  I thought that was pretty amusing, indeed.  It&#8217;s even funnier because it&#8217;s a random thing to have a commercial for on the radio.  It&#8217;s not as if it&#8217;s a bed or electronic that everyone can use.  Although I suppose that if I could appeal to half of my audience then I would take that also.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well I saw something the other day that struck me as ironic.  It was a car with many bumper stickers.  Now that in and of itself is not necessary ironic.  (Unless of course you&#8217;re driving a nice car with ugly stickers on it as I commented in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/11/sell-your-porsche/">Sell Your Porsche</a>.)  But there was a bumper sticker of an Israeli flag, and there was a license plate frame that was from <a href="http://www.hillcrestcs.org/">Hillcrest Christian School</a>.  How does that work?</p>

<p>You know, I could very well be wrong because it might not be that ironic after all.  They could just be <a href="http://www.jewsforjesus.org/">Jews for Jesus</a>.  And that would be quite nice.  I would have liked to have met them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do any of you read magazines anymore?  Does anyone?  Well I do.  Sometimes anyways.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been noticing things about the advertisements in magazines.  Well I guess depending on the magazine that you are reading, things are different.  However, with some of the magazines that I&#8217;ve recently read, the thing that I don&#8217;t understand is why advertisers would even want their advertisements placed in the back.  Do people even look at them (I know that I don&#8217;t)?  Is their respective business increased as a result of being placed amongst many other advertisements?  I just don&#8217;t get it.</p>

<p>Are they scared that if they stop advertising, that their business will decrease?  It seems to me that it&#8217;s hard to justify the cost of placing such a poorly placed advertisement.  Well, the poorly placed is just my opinion.  Stuck in the nether pages with other random advertisements is not exactly a place that readers like to peruse carefully if you ask me.</p>

<p>I think that some of the best advertisements are those that give you something simply by looking.  Well I am still talking about magazine advertisements so this does not apply to other advertisements.  In any case, have you read those advertisements that give you some useful information and/or organize what they&#8217;re selling so that it&#8217;s very appealing.  On the one hand, I like these because they&#8217;re useful to me.  On the other hand I have to take it all with a grain of salt because it <em>is</em> still an advertisement.</p>

<p>In any case, I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m ever going to be someone who will advertise in a magazine.  But then again, I guess that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t make my living in the areas of fashion, car parts, or male enhancement gimmicks.</p>
