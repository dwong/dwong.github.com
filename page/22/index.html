  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nobody is born with the ability to do everything.  Somehow we have to learn things.  Even when we are talented at something, we still need to actually learn it before our talent can manifest itself.</p>

<p>When I was learning how to drive a manual transmission, I got to go out with other people as I learned the basics of how it worked.  But trying things out every couple of weeks could only get me so far.  It was only when I got my own vehicle and had the chance to go out by myself that I started to work things out.  Sure I failed.  Sometimes miserably so.  I can still remember some of those violent stalls where it felt as if the automobile body was going to separate from the wheels.  But eventually it came together.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve learned that while it&#8217;s easy to dictate (or be dictated to), it&#8217;s much better to give people the opportunity to shine.  In other words, teaching a man to fish means sometimes the man doesn&#8217;t catch a thing.  But he will.</p>

<p>Or&#8230;he&#8217;ll starve.  In which case, I don&#8217;t know because the illustration doesn&#8217;t really cover that scenario.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve all seen people that have more hair than others.  There are some that also have hair where others might not have it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these follicles are not really something that we get to choose.  Whether we like it or not, we have genes that entirely dictate such things as the color of our hair, our height, and where hair grows on our body.  We can try to change these things through dye, clothing, and hair removal (or implantation).  But in reality we are who we are made to be.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s sad that we judge people based on things that they cannot change.  (This is in no way a political statement about homosexuality, even though it&#8217;s becoming apparent to me that it can be interpreted as such.  Or maybe it&#8217;s just been on the mind with Proposition 8 in California.  Anyways, see <a href="http://www.narth.com/docs/istheregene.html">this</a> for some truth about the &#8220;gay gene&#8221; research done by Dr. Dean Hamer.  But I digress.)</p>

<p>So people can&#8217;t control things like where their hair grows.  How do we in society get so disgusted by it?  I admit that I can/do as well.  But it&#8217;s strange how we can make demeaning statements about  things that are not determined by these people at all!</p>

<p>Sometimes society stinks.  And for sure mobs of people are no good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Music is a wonderful thing.  Throughout the ages, it has been created and enjoyed by man.  It has ranged from the beat of the drum to the clang of the cymbal to the strings of the violin.</p>

<p>In and of itself, music is innocuous.  It is the words, lyrics, and association that we attach to these series of notes that give them their meaning.  That brings me to the point where I wonder at the derision of specific genres of music.  While I&#8217;m not a fan of every type of music (hardcore rock comes to mind), I do wonder sometimes at the motivation that people have for judgment.</p>

<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve often heard both Christians and non-Christians deride so-called Christian rap (aka Gospel Rap, Holy Hip Hop, and so on and so on).  Basically it&#8217;s music that identifies itself as hip hop with lyrics that could in someway be identified as Christian.  It seems that people mock it because they think that the combination of a culture of sex, drugs, and money that is often associated with the hip hop culture cannot be combined with what they perceive as stodgy, conservative Christianity.  Since they cannot go hand in hand, it&#8217;s worthy of derision.</p>

<p>And yet I can pretty readily admit that I listen to and enjoy some of the music in this genre.  While I&#8217;m most definitely a fan of a wide variety of music (classic pop, r&b;, show tunes, alternative, trance, and more), some of my favorite artists might very well be clumped into this group.</p>

<p>Why I enjoy Christian rap:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Like-mindedness</strong> - While a lot of the groups and artists that I listen to don&#8217;t constantly mention the name of Jesus Christ, I enjoy listening to them because I know that we come from the same place.  We&#8217;re more alike than different because we are more fundamentally similar than to someone who does not share the faith.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lyrics</strong> - Hardly anybody on the radio even has interesting lyrics.  It&#8217;s the same old game of sex, money, and women.  Soulja boy?  Hardly stimulating.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Creativity</strong> - So granted, I don&#8217;t listen to a lot of underground secular rappers.  But in my experience it seems that Christian groups that I listen to are much more wiling to try new things than the factory-pressed tracks heard on the radio.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keeping It Real</strong> - This might seem extremely strange in a genre that many people think of as utterly fake, but I think that they&#8217;re being more real when they create their works.  They&#8217;re using their entire being, from their background in the &#8216;hood all of the way to their conversion because of Christ.  They&#8217;re not trying to hide these things, and I can respect that.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So I don&#8217;t enjoy ever single Christian rapper that I listen to.  Far from it.  But the same is true across the board for all musical genres.  Personally I enjoy those Christian rappers that like to talk about life, just like how I like to talk about life here on this blog.  But that is my own taste.</p>

<p>Even though it&#8217;s been popular in society to mock the Jesus that I believe in (Jesus is my homeboy anyone?), I won&#8217;t be party to it.  I rather wonder why people act that way.  Is it because (in the case of Christians) they&#8217;re insecure about being so in-your-face about the faith?  Or perhaps it&#8217;s because (in the case of non-Christians) they haven&#8217;t experienced the same change?</p>

<p>Whatever it is, I might not ever know.</p>

<p>Some of my favorites are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>4th Avenue Jones (which have disbanded)</p></li>
<li><p>L.A. Symphony</p></li>
<li><p>Pigeon John (formerly of L.A. Symphony)</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past weekend I completed the <a href="http://runlongbeach.com/site5.aspx">Long Beach half marathon</a>.  While it&#8217;s probably no big deal to some people, it was my first so it was a big deal to me.</p>

<p>Someday I want to run a marathon (some might say that it&#8217;s on my &#8220;bucket list&#8221;).  I figured that a half marathon would be a good place to start off at since the most that I&#8217;d run previous to my training was a 10K.</p>

<p>So it&#8217;s done, now I just need to figure out when I want to spend $100 to run 26.2 miles.  Oh how I relish the opportunity.</p>
