  <div class="entry-content"><p>That title probably gets your attention.  As is common knowledge, we need shoes in order to run.  Running barefoot is impossible to comprehend.  Except&#8230;it&#8217;s not.  There are so many reasons that I have found that compel me to run barefoot.  And I figured that now would be a good time to post them here.</p>

<p>I have been running barefoot for over 9 months now.  I started off running a few blocks, and I have progressed to now run a few miles a couple of times each week.  Yes, it will sometimes be briefly uncomfortable when I step on a pebble, but it is usually gone in the next step.  However for most people the thought of pain is enough to prevent them from ever trying to run barefoot.  On the other hand, just because I run on the street does not mean that everyone has to.  [caption id=&#8221;&#8221; align=&#8221;alignright&#8221; width=&#8221;240&#8221; caption=&#8221;Yep, that&#8217;s mine&#8221;]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gtww/3706453438/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2554/3706453438_b247aaa513_m.jpg" alt="Yep, thats mine" /></a>[/caption]Running on sand or grass would definitely be more comfortable, but it&#8217;s really not that bad running on the pavement (in my opinion).  I believe that running barefoot is better, and I want my behavior to be in accordance with my beliefs.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was <strong>not born</strong> with shoes.  (Of course I also wasn&#8217;t born with clothes, but clothes don&#8217;t injure me.  If they did, I wouldn&#8217;t wear those either.)</li>
<li><strong>Injuries increase with the price</strong> of the shoes according to surveys from runners.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s recommended (by pediatricians) that <strong>young children be allowed to walk around barefoot</strong> so that they can develop their feet.  There must be something there, right?</li>
<li>By the laws of <strong>physics</strong> the force of each step when running has to be translated and absorved somewhere.  Running sure isn&#8217;t hurting your feet.  Where does that leave?  Perhaps the knees and hips?</li>
<li>Tough and hardened feet are much more <strong>useful</strong> than soft tender feet.  Soft feet are nice to the touch, but they can&#8217;t nearly do what used feet can do.  If you had to run away from danger, you can&#8217;t exactly stop to put on your shoes.</li>
<li>Without the artificial support of shoes, your feet need to balance and adapt.  That is, the <strong>muscles and tendons in your feet will get stronger</strong>.  It&#8217;s similar to why it&#8217;s excellent to do exercises without artificial support.  You need to balance while also performing the task at hand.  And that will make you stronger and strengthen the entire structure.</li>
<li>There sure are a lot of people from <strong>other countries</strong> that are awesome runners without the need for shoes.  Have you ever thought about that?  Not only are they awesome, but they have lower incidence of injury.  Just because I wasn&#8217;t born in a culture like that does not mean that I cannot become like that!</li>
<li>I stand for <strong>freedom</strong>!.  I always have, I always will.  But it is a different kind of freedom that I feel when I&#8217;m running barefoot.  It kind of makes me feel like a little kid, and I love that.</li>
<li>The arch is one of the strongest structures known to man.  We use it for bridges to hold up amazing amounts of weight.  Have you ever seen an arched bridge have something filling the entire arch?  No.  That&#8217;s because the <strong>arch is strongest when there is nothing filling that gap</strong>.  Surprise, surprise guess where we have an arch.</li>
<li>One of the most important reason to consider running barefoot is that it makes you more <strong>conscious of your running form</strong>.  So while your form might suffer when you&#8217;re running with shod feet, you won&#8217;t modify your behavior because it doesn&#8217;t manifest itself until years of running have beaten your body down.  However you will definitely notice the difference with bare feet.  You will not strike your heel.  You will land on the balls of your feet.  You will be careful of where you go.  You could learn how to run with better form from someone teaching you.  But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re necessarily going to change.  Pain is a much better way to modify your behavior than mere information.  It&#8217;s a reminder every step that you need to run correctly.</li>
</ul>


<p>I run barefoot.  I enjoy it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The whole situation with the California budget crisis is ridiculous.  It is looking very likely that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE55T7E120090630">California will have to issue IOUs</a> as the new fiscal year rolls around.  How did we get into this pickle?  The recession!  The decreased revenue from falling property taxes and lack of state income taxes from those who are not working has left the Golden State in a huge predicament.  $24.3 BILLION??  That is ridiculous.</p>

<p>In the special election on May 19, 2009, the people of this state voted against the increased taxes that were proposed.  I am a fairly modest supporter of our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Governator</a> as he is standing against the tide.  I agree with his observation that the people of California are sick and tired of living in the most taxed state of the United States of America!  Even though he has not always been my favorite politician (really who is?), I am glad that he is attempting to stand for what he thinks that the people want.</p>

<p>Democratic state politicians on the other hard are, inexplicably, ridiculous.  While they, too, are trying to stand for what they think that the people want, they are doing it in a way that is illogical.  From trying to find loopholes to pass the budget with a simple majority (since they can&#8217;t pass what they want without Republican support) to trying to pass tax increases along with budget cuts, they are not making the process extremely difficult.  They are still trying to get theirs while seeming to not understand what basic tasks they need to do in order to get the state&#8217;s finances in order.</p>

<p>Let us put it simply: California <strong>needs</strong> to cut its costs.  It doesn&#8217;t have the money and at this point it is not reasonable to increase the taxes that it imposes on its population.  At some point people are going to get tired of paying so much for the privilege of wonderful weather (and horrible smog).  I wonder if the politicians know this.  Maybe good old Mr. Olympia himself knows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Silence is golden at the movies.  How much is it worth everywhere else?  It&#8217;s usually trouble to dispense knowledge and wisdom to everyone around.</p>

<p>People don&#8217;t like to be told what to do.  Have you ever noticed that it is sometimes harder to tell those that are close to you about something compared to telling those that are not as close?  Why is it that a close friend or family member can tell you something that will cause a negative knee-jerk reaction when the same opinion from a perceived detached and objective party will be received well?</p>

<p>It seems to me like part of wisdom is knowing when to be quiet and give others a chance to succeed.  Surprise, surprise maybe other people don&#8217;t want me to solve all of their problems, even if I could.  Perhaps maybe a little more love in all things, without which I am nothing even if I am the wisest person in the world.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading <a href="http://www.boundless.org/2005/articles/a0002060.cfm">The Long Journey From Obesity</a>, I started to realize that I was like the author before she became an obese person.  At times I look down on obese people because I think that it <strong>is</strong> possible for them to lose weight.  And while I still do think that it is true for them in a lot of cases, I can easily lose sight of the fact that being skinny is not the most important thing.</p>

<p>There are skinny gluttonous people and there are larger fit people.  Size is not of the utmost importance.  It would do me well to remember this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been working on a budgeting application called <a href="http://budse.sourceforge.net/">Budse</a> (actually for quite some time now).  It&#8217;s a straight forward application that allows you to create a set of accounts that have rules assigned to them, which dictate how to split up whole account deposits (e.g., a paycheck).  I originally had the idea because I wanted to start budgeting using the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/199/is-the-40-30-20-10-rule-too-ideal/">40-30-20-10 rule</a>.  But then I realized that I wanted to use the idea but customize it a little bit more for my needs.</p>

<p>But enough about the details.  On to my point.</p>

<p>So I am working on Budse by myself.  I started the project, and it has been a one-man show the whole time.  As an individual developer working on an open source project, sometimes I dream.  I start to think big about people actually using it.  Big dreams, I know.  Haha currently I doubt it if anyone aside from me uses it.  When I was coding and especially when I was deciding on how to license it, I thought that since it fulfilled my need it would be useful to other people as well.  Maybe that&#8217;s not true.  Maybe it is.  It remains to be seen.</p>

<p>It is so easy to dream of becoming great.  But maybe dreaming big isn&#8217;t such a bad thing.  Maybe if I lost the ability to dream big, I would lose a little bit of who I am.  So while I am currently unsatisfied with its use, I am definitely going to press forward!</p>
