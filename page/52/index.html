  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nowadays as nearly everyone has interaction with the Internet in some way, it is important to stop and think about how people might actually be <em>using</em> the Internet.  Actually, right now I want to look at how some people might be <strong>inconsiderately</strong> using the Internet.</p>

<p>There are a few things that I&#8217;ve recently realized are inconsiderate browsing habits.  To start off with, you must know that for the Firefox browser, there are programs that can be installed called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:1">Firefox extensions</a>.  I&#8217;d like to use a couple as examples of some of the browsing habits that are inconsiderate.  However, it must be noted that they are not the actual habit, but they are rather a means to an end.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10">Adblock</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1136">Filterset.G Updater</a></strong> are both super extensions that are often the first that I&#8217;ll install when I have a new installation of Firefox.  Basically they attempt to take the ads out of your Internet browsing experience.  And they work very well.  Adblock will basically filter out anything that you you specify.  It is as easy as right-clicking on an ad and adding it to the list to be blocked.  However this takes a long time to build up a reasonable list.  Luckily it also allows you to use some pattern matching (similar to <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/16/chopped-returns-in-perl/">regular expressions</a>) to allow you to make your list useful in a shorter list.  Basically it allows you to match multiple things with a single pattern.</li>
</ol>


<p>This is not easy for most people.  So in comes the Filterset.G Updater!  It uses a master list that someone else has taken the time to create.  It will match almost all of the ads that you would have normally encountered.  Of course some sites are good enough to get around this.  Nevertheless it leads to a pretty ad-free browsing experience that is incomparable to one filled with pop-ups and more ads than content.</p>

<p>The inconsideration involved is this: websites need those ads as a source of revenue.  Although I&#8217;ve only realized much of this by having my own site, it does make a lot of sense.  Many sites that you read are free to use.  However, they often need some income in order to stay free.  It costs money to host a website (sometimes a good deal of it).  When you&#8217;re browsing a site with ads, it is similar in idea to watching television with commercials.  Television uses the revenue that is garnered by having commercials in order to create the content.  Merely by the fact that you&#8217;re watching the show (and subsequently in some way affecting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielson_ratings">Nielson Ratings</a>), you are allowing the television company to charge more for their commercial time.</p>

<p>Advertising on the Internet works similarly.  I&#8217;m talking specifically about Google AdSense because I have experience with it, but this valid for almost all other advertisement programs.  There are a couple of ways that users help support  a site monetarily through their advertisement program.</p>

<pre><code>1. Viewing an ad.  Simply by viewing an ad with the content, users are helping out the site because many ad programs will allow advertisers to purchase space that ends up paying per view (or impression in AdSense speak).  The more views a site gets, the more it gets paid.


2. Clicking on an ad.  This is definitely applicable for all advertisement programs out there because nearly all of them will pay a site publisher (those producing the content for a site) based on how many clicks that an ad gets.  There are a number of ways that a publisher might put ads on their website, but that is another matter entirely.
</code></pre>

<p>What does this mean for you?  Well I don&#8217;t know what it means for you.  But for me it means that I will try to browse in a way that supports the website.  As I use the Adblock extension, I can easily do this by</p>

<pre><code>1. Clicking the Tools menu


2. Going to the Adblock item


3. Click Whitelist this page or Whitelist this entire site
</code></pre>

<p>Whitelisting a site means that you have given that site priority to not have anything blocked by Adblock.  To undo this, on the whitelisted paged you can follow the same procedures as above.  On top of whitelisting pages/site, you might consider clicking some ads.  Don&#8217;t think that you&#8217;re giving your life away because ads are getting better and better nowadays.  Very often they are related to the content that you&#8217;re reading (for contextually-based ad programs).  So don&#8217;t avoid ads like the plague, they do some good by monetarily supporting sites that you are enjoying for free.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1269">Fasterfox</a></strong> is another extension that highlights some inconsiderate browsing habits.  This extension will basically tweak the Firefox settings to give you a faster browsing experience.  This seems very cool because it helps you out as the end-user.</li>
</ol>


<p>However, this is actually fairly inconsiderate some of the time.  The way that this extension works is that you can set how much tweaking you want the extension to do for you.  At its extreme, it will prefetch (follow the link and load the page before you actually click on it) pages, open multiple connections to servers, and more.  Obviously this puts more a load on the server than is necessary because you will not always click every link in a page nor will you absolutely need to load a page 1 second quicker.  By putting an extra load on the server, you are unnecessarily making it harder for the server to serve its content to other people who might want it.</p>

<p>Now, this does not affect low-traffic sites like my own because I could happily handle way more traffic than I currently do.  But it does affect higher-traffic sites because they are already closer to being pushed over the edge.  And that is just not nice.  Other variations of this inconsiderate browsing habit are constantly refreshing pages for no reason, etc.</p>

<ol>
<li>Utilizing <strong><a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a></strong> is actually somewhat inconsiderate because it often results in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddos#Distributed_attack">Distributed Denial of Service</a>.  Without going into <em>too</em> much detail, this is basically when lots and lots of people will simultaneously access a site and overwhelm its ability to serve pages.  This means that either some hardware will go down or people who actually would like to visit a site will not be able to because they are stuck behind everyone else waiting for the page.  Granted, I participate in using Digg, but it still can definitely be an inconsiderate browsing habit.  Consider using caches that have been made of that page.  Hopefully most sites that get dugg will be able to handle the traffic and will actually benefit in some way from it (I try to find good ads to help them out with if I like what they have to say).</li>
</ol>


<p>In the end, you just basically have to think about how your actions affect others and not just yourself.  Apparently, that&#8217;s true for life as well.</p>

<p><edit>
After I thought about it a bit, I wanted to add this little bit.  By writing this entry I am by no means asking you to support my site though my advertisements.  That would be underhanded as well as a likely violation of the Terms of Service for using their programs.  But I think that people don&#8217;t really know about all of this.  So read my entry, but I want what you do with this information to be up to you.  But at least now you know.  :)

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well of course things go on, so I wanted to write my thoughts at this junction about the NBA Playoffs 2007.</p>

<p>I was hoping that the <strong>Golden State Warriors</strong> would get farther than the second round.  However I became ambivalent as Baron Davis&#8217; personality (as well as Stephen Jackson&#8217;s) came out.  That elbow to Derek Fisher&#8217;s face?  Unnecessary to the extreme.  To say that I gained a lot and lost a lot of respect for the Warriors would be fair to say.  I enjoyed their playing because they were passionate and energetic.  I started to disapprove of them because many of them turned out to be a bunch of no-class, cocky-without-rights-to, complaining-to-no-end players.  And that is not a team that I want to cheer for.  So they&#8217;re out, and good riddance.</p>

<p>A lot of people disliked <strong>Derek Fisher</strong> when he was on the Lakers.  I never felt as strongly about him.  In fact, I kind of liked him.  He had spirit and he played hard.  Plus we share the same first name.  He&#8217;s by no means the best at his position, but he&#8217;s definitely shown in the Jazz vs Warriors series that he&#8217;s got lots left in that tank.  To see him also having to deal with everything going on with his daughter makes him an especially easy-to-cheer-for player.  Bravo on being an impact player in the series.</p>

<p>There sure has been a lot of <strong>testiness</strong> in these playoffs.  Is it just me or does it seem like there is more this year than in recent history?  Pretty much every series has had some episode of a flareup.  LeBron is stepping up, the Pistons are never exactly clean, the aforementioned Warriors and Jazz got it on, and of course the Suns and the Spurs have no love lost for their fellow Texans.  It all makes for exciting and emotional games, but I kind of wonder why this year is so.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m cheering for the <strong>Chicago Bulls</strong> to beat the Pistons.  I&#8217;m not a huge Bulls fan, but I have enjoyed watching them play this year.  Unfortunately they seem like they go very cold at times, and that led to the Pistons taking a (seemingly) insurmountable 3-0 series lead on them.  They&#8217;ve fought back to 3-2, and everyone has been singing their praise.  I&#8217;d like to see them down the vaunted Pistons myself.</p>

<p>I barely even hear or see much from the <strong>Cleveland Cavaliers</strong> side of the bracket.  The Wizards series went down very quietly.  It&#8217;s no surprise, but the West seems to definitely be the better conference.</p>

<p><strong>Robert Horry&#8217;s forearm to Nash&#8217;s face</strong> was pretty poor.  I always kind of liked Horry because I enjoyed his late-game heroics.  I&#8217;m not really sure what the beef between the Suns and the Spurs is, but I know this: they don&#8217;t like each other.  I&#8217;m not a fan of many of them myself.  Many of them (Manu Ginobili, Bruce Bowen, Raja Bell to name a few) are aggressive bordering on extremely dirty.  And that&#8217;s no good.  But I like watching the series because both of these teams are pretty good.  They have different styles but they both have multiple superstars who combine to do amazing things sometimes.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The NBA Playoffs 2007 are definitely interesting.  I like seeing people get emotional, but there&#8217;s no need to be a jerk about things.  Keep it coming.  I&#8217;m going to enjoy watching more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Files on computers are made up of different characters that are interpreted by whatever it is that you are using.  That means that no matter what file it is, it is essentially a string of bytes that are interpreted by the program opening it.  This means that your music program tries to interpret whatever file you open with it to be conformed to some audio standards (mp3, wma, etc.).  Try to open the same file in a text editor, and you&#8217;ll find yourself looking at (apparently) junk characters.  But then you&#8217;ll realize that the file is still just a bunch of characters.</p>

<p>I bring this up because</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It seems as if people don&#8217;t realize this.</p></li>
<li><p>I encountered this while writing a Perl script today.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Something else that you should read even if you don&#8217;t know what Perl is: Windows and Unix-variants (including Mac OS X and up) do not handle files the same.  I&#8217;m not talking about <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/28/fanaticism/">Fanaticism</a> (because I&#8217;ve already posted about that).  Windows uses characters that are referred to as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return">Carriage Return</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_feed">Line Feed</a> in order to represent a newline.  These names originate because of their original use in the typewriter which actually had a physical mechanism to move.  In any case, Unix-variants utilize the line feed character to distinguish its newlines.  This can obviously lead to some problems if you use the same files on both systems.</p>

<p><strong>If you don&#8217;t know what Perl is then you can fairly safely stop reading this article now because the rest won&#8217;t help you much.</strong>  I know that it was hard for me to find and I&#8217;d like to make it available if anyone else so happens to run into the same problem.</p>

<p>While writing a script in Perl today, I had a seemingly strange problem where I would do some processing on my Windows machine and then transfer the file via FTP to a Unix-based server.  However I noticed that I had a string that when printed to the screen on my Windows computer would display correctly but would display incorrectly in the file put onto the server.  I could not figure this out for quite sometime because it seemed as if some of the lines were printing correctly and some were not.  Alright enough explanation.  Essentially I thought that the last character was getting chopped off in some way that I did not understand in Perl.  However it had to do with Perl assuming that the lines has both a carriage return and a line feed on the lines and then chopping them off when the file was being sent via FTP.  The fix that I ended up using was simply a one line regular expression like so (a suggestion from a co-worker):</p>

<p><code>$output=</code>some action<code>;
$output=~ s/n/rn/g;
print $output;
print FOUT $output;</code></p>

<p>Hope that this helps someone searching for an answer.  I know that I would have liked to have happened upon the answer while searching for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a cost to running your own web server.  I&#8217;m not talking about the actual monetary cost, although there definitely is some of that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m talking about the down time and lack of production-level reliability.  I just got my Internet connection back up after being down nearly the entire day!  I had checked the status in the morning, and it was working.  However, when I got to work I couldn&#8217;t access it.  &#8220;Oh great,&#8221; I thought.</p>

<p>So basically I just lost a day of traffic, readership, etc.  Great, that just stinks.  You know I wonder what my uptime percentage is.  I was thinking about it today as a result of not having it available, and I am positive that I am up more than 9 days out of 10.  However, I&#8217;m pretty sure that I couldn&#8217;t claim more than 95%.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Anyways, I think that the benefits to running my own web server outweigh the cost.  Let me share what I think some of them are.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Learn more about how the Internet works by becoming more than a user, become a cog.</p></li>
<li><p>Know <em>exactly</em> where all of your data is stored</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t have to pay for hosting costs (okay, okay there is the electricity to run the computer which is definitely something.  But you&#8217;re not getting charged 15 bucks a month like you normally would be.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn interesting server-related things such as configuring Apache.  This is especially interesting for those who have a professional interest in computers I think.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Is it worth it to you?  I don&#8217;t even know what the percentages are of people who run their own server.  I actually don&#8217;t know too many people that do.  Of course I guess that speaks more about the people that I know than what is actually going on.  In any case, sorry for the downtime, and I&#8217;m back (for now).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an article at Yahoo! about <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/43610153">cracking down on college music pirates</a>, I read about one Sarah Barg, a sophomore from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  It portrayed her as a girl who was just taking part in what everyone else was doing.  The article wanted to put her in the role of one who is definitely not the worst (I mean she <em>only</em> downloaded 381 songs when others were downloading thousands!).  In response to it all, Barg says</p>

<blockquote><p>Obviously I knew it was illegal, but no one got in trouble for it</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, I know that all higher education is not equal.  And I know that maybe not all of them are as good as the <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>, but that does not allow for such ridiculous thoughts.  I think that ignorance is not a good excuse for doing wrong.  The onus is on you to do what&#8217;s right.  However, I think that actually knowing that something is wrong and yet still doing it speaks of some darker black.</p>

<p>In any case, I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s a matter of intelligence.  I think it&#8217;s a sign of the times.</p>

<p>Piracy does not just affect music as I wrote in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/14/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/">Even Worse Than At First Glance</a>, <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/04/cheatin-chinese/">Cheain&#8217; Chinese</a>, and (in regards to cheating in general) <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/">Cheaters 4 Life</a>.  Wow I did not realize that I had so many entries devoted to ranting about cheaters!  But I digress.</p>

<p>Reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t be a (music) pirate:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can afford the music (or whatever it is that you&#8217;re pirating).</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>* If you can't afford it, you don't need it.


* If you really can't afford it, you have things that you should be doing other than listening to music anyways.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>You can support and encourage the artists that you like to keep making music.  It&#8217;s kind of like writing a blog and getting encouraged by people leaving comments.  Except for them it&#8217;s people giving them money.  I&#8217;m applying my energy to the wrong thing.  :P</p></li>
<li><p>You know it&#8217;s morally wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s actually against the law.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now I admit that I&#8217;m not perfect, but I would like to think that once I knew the truth then I would change my behavior to match what I know.  Not everyone is like this.  But they should be.  It just makes sense to have your behavior in line with your opinions, does it not?  Don&#8217;t be the person who gets laughed at for coming off as stupid.  Nobody wants 15 minutes of infamy.</p>
