  <div class="entry-content"><p>What would you think?</p>

<p>If you were in Irvine, CA, USA at approximately 9:05 AM on February 21, 2007, and you saw a man of Chinese origin approximately 5&#8217; 11&#8221;, 180 pounds walking from the parking structure to his building, what would you think?  You wouldn&rsquo;t think too much since he was dressed in a business casual manner so he fit in with the corporate surroundings.  But wait!  Something isn&rsquo;t quite right&hellip;ah yes there it is&hellip;  He is wearing a brown shoe on his right foot and a black one on his left.  Ah you see him scurrying back to his car as he realizes his mistake.  You might later discover that he keeps his shoes in his truck because he only wears them for work (and wears some <a href="http://rainbowsandals.com/zzPremierLeathers.asp#Double%20Layer%20Arch,%20Premier%20Leather">Sierra Browns</a> for all of the time up to and after he absolutely has to put his shoes on).  Additionally, that particular morning he decided to just put his shoes on while sitting in the front seat.  Unfortunately it was rather dark in the parking structure (as many such structures can be) and he simply reached back to grab his shoes while continuing to listen to <a href="http://amzn.to/MELt8z">his music</a>.  He even tried to hold them up to check them after he grabbed them, but seeing as the light was very dim would be unable to differentiate between dark colors (such as say brown and black).  Even as he put them on he thought that the laces felt different but in his own silly manner he didn&rsquo;t bother to look at them when in better light.  And thus goes another day in his life.  A small glimmer of amusement.</p>

<p>So what would you think?  (It is verifiable this author would laugh his head off at such a creature.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a></p>

<p>These Emacs tips might be useful to somebody out there.  And at the very least it will provide me with a place to look up things that I have already searched for before.  Now that I look at them, they seem rather rudimentary but far be it from me to keep something that I found useful from others.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure this one out for awhile.)  To search for a string from one buffer in another buffer:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>C-w</strong> (or <strong>M-w</strong>) the search string</li>
<li>move to the buffer to search in</li>
<li><strong>C-s</strong></li>
<li><strong>M-y</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Synchronized scrolling: <strong>M-x scroll-all-mode</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Scroll other window:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>M-C-v</strong> scrolls down</p></li>
<li><p><strong>M-C-V</strong> scrolls up</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat a command numerous times: <strong>M-(number) (command)</strong> where you fill in (number) with a number and (command) with the command that you want to repeat.  To use a number that is not a single digit you hold <strong>M</strong> while pressing the first number and then release <strong>M</strong> while pressing the rest of the numbers.  An example: to kill 10 lines you would do: <strong>M-1 0 C-k</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Notes:
<strong>M</strong> is the Meta key (usually Alt or Esc depending on your operating system/settings)
<strong>C</strong> is the Control key</p>

<p>Emacs can be great if you know how to use it.  :)</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>Characterized by intending to impress others with obvious and conspicuous show.</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>The engagement ring is a significant symbol to people but the 4 carat diamond that she keeps flaunting is simply ostentatious.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This word is a synonym of &ldquo;showy&rdquo; and can be incorporated to more aptly describe someone&rsquo;s behavior rather than saying that they are &ldquo;showing-off&rdquo;, as is more commonly done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Read this</strong> (even if you think that this is going to be another nerdy entry)!</p>

<p>You might learn something.  I have found that there are a whole lot of people who have no idea what RSS is.  That&rsquo;s a shame because I think that a lot of them would find it to be useful.</p>

<p>RSS stands for <strong>R</strong>eally <strong>S</strong>imple <strong>S</strong>yndication and is a really easy way to view the content for dynamic (frequently changing) websites.  Good examples of websites that change frequently are news sites, blogs, etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you could see the icons (like <a href="http://www.feedicons.com/">this</a>) around the Internet on web pages if you really looked.  To utilize this technology, you have to understand what it is.  Basically an RSS &ldquo;feed&rdquo; is a special link to a website that allows you to quickly see the content that is being changed on the site.</p>

<p>So to start off, you obviously you need a feed reader (also called an aggregator or a news aggregator) in order to view the content of your feeds.  If you use Firefox you can try <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/424/">this</a> or even subscribe with Firefox itself using &ldquo;Live Bookmarks&rdquo;.  There are also tons more that you can find online.  I tried one from <a href="http://email.about.com/od/rssfeedreaders/Find_the_Best_RSS_Feed_Readers_News_Aggregators.htm">here</a> that worked just fine.  Once you have your reader install, you definitely need at least one site to get a feed from.  You can find the links on pages, and often times these links will be sensed by your web browser and display an icon in the address bar that makes it easy to subscribe to.  An example of a link would be:
**<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoingTheWongWay?format=xml**">http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoingTheWongWay?format=xml**</a>
Once you have this link, and input this into your reader in whatever way you are supposed to, you are up and running!</p>

<p>To give you even more incentive of why you should do this, it turns out that you can use this for other blogging sites that you might not have thought of.  For the xanga readers, you are essentially doing this when you read &ldquo;Your Subscriptions&rdquo;.  You can incorporate xanga sites into your new RSS feed reader using links like <a href="http://www.xanga.com/rss.aspx?user=keleka">this</a> where you just replace the &ldquo;keleka&rdquo; part of that address with the user that you&rsquo;re subscribing to.  Add a whole bunch of those links and suddenly you have an easy way to read a whole bunch of different types of &ldquo;subscriptions&rdquo;.  Happy reading!</p>
