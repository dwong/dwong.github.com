  <div class="entry-content"><p>[prag-<strong>mat</strong>-ik]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>To be of or pertaining to having a practical point of view.</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>The pragmatic woman couldn&#8217;t be won over with flowers or romantic gestures, she always just saw them as a waste of money.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This word is really easy to remember because it SOUNDS like &#8220;practical&#8221;.  And since practical is basically its definition, you have an interesting word that is easy to incorporate into your everyday language.  Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So this weekend I went to San Diego (well more like La Jolla, home to <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu">my favorite college</a>) in part to hang out and visit but also in part to celebrate with <a href="http://www.adropofwater.net">Mr. Hoffman</a> and Miss Lin as they got engaged.</p>

<p>Some of the highlights were getting to go to the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/fpfBFfgbclSjMYMZXpo7lg">new location</a> of <a href="http://www.philsbbq.com">Phil&#8217;s BBQ</a> (one of the best BBQ eateries around in my opinion), getting to hang out with friends, and getting to hang out at <a href="http://www.xanga.com/redbricks">Allison&#8217;s</a> place.  But it made me realize that even though college was fun, I do not long for the things in the past.  Unfortunately, there are many out there that do.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I have found that it is rather interesting when you encounter people who constantly have a desire for what has happened before.  There are the older people who long for &#8220;the good old days&#8221;, and there are friends who seem to have only had a couple of note-worthy experiences in their entire life that they enjoy re-hashing over and over again.  There are those that tell the same jokes repeatedly thinking that the humor of the joke continues to remain constant, and there are those who restrict themselves based on what&#8217;s happened in the past.  Frankly I find that none of those approaches make much sense.  What is life if we are unable to change ourselves and have new experiences?  How can we have great experiences if we are stuck in the pat re-living the old antiquated ones?  The simple answer is that we can&#8217;t.  (Note: I just had to add the category <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/category/rant/">&#8220;Rant&#8221;</a> to this post because it apparently has turned into one.)</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>Despite what I (and many others out there) think, people are not as boring as they may at first glance be.  We all have a mind, and we all have a history.  We all have to like <em>something</em>.  So what I am trying to do (and perhaps you might want to as well) is to live in such a way that I won&#8217;t be that person existing in the past or boring people with the same old thing.  Read a book, learn a musical instrument, learn how something complicated works (like a computer or a car), or even just read the encyclopedia!  (Although I must admit that most people would be more apt to read <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">this</a> instead.)</p>

<p><strong>Basically it is time for people to become more interesting.</strong>  I know that it&#8217;s there, so let&#8217;s all make it happen.  Good luck to you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What would you think?</p>

<p>If you were in Irvine, CA, USA at approximately 9:05 AM on February 21, 2007, and you saw a man of Chinese origin approximately 5&#8217; 11&#8221;, 180 pounds walking from the parking structure to his building, what would you think?  You wouldn&#8217;t think too much since he was dressed in a business casual manner so he fit in with the corporate surroundings.  But wait!  Something isn&#8217;t quite right&#8230;ah yes there it is&#8230;  He is wearing a brown shoe on his right foot and a black one on his left.  Ah you see him scurrying back to his car as he realizes his mistake.  You might later discover that he keeps his shoes in his truck because he only wears them for work (and wears some <a href="http://rainbowsandals.com/zzPremierLeathers.asp#Double%20Layer%20Arch,%20Premier%20Leather">Sierra Browns</a> for all of the time up to and after he absolutely has to put his shoes on).  Additionally, that particular morning he decided to just put his shoes on while sitting in the front seat.  Unfortunately it was rather dark in the parking structure (as many such structures can be) and he simply reached back to grab his shoes while continuing to listen to <a href="http://amzn.to/MELt8z">his music</a>.  He even tried to hold them up to check them after he grabbed them, but seeing as the light was very dim would be unable to differentiate between dark colors (such as say brown and black).  Even as he put them on he thought that the laces felt different but in his own silly manner he didn&#8217;t bother to look at them when in better light.  And thus goes another day in his life.  A small glimmer of amusement.</p>

<p>So what would you think?  (It is verifiable this author would laugh his head off at such a creature.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a></p>

<p>These Emacs tips might be useful to somebody out there.  And at the very least it will provide me with a place to look up things that I have already searched for before.  Now that I look at them, they seem rather rudimentary but far be it from me to keep something that I found useful from others.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(I&#8217;ve been trying to figure this one out for awhile.)  To search for a string from one buffer in another buffer:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>C-w</strong> (or <strong>M-w</strong>) the search string</li>
<li>move to the buffer to search in</li>
<li><strong>C-s</strong></li>
<li><strong>M-y</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Synchronized scrolling: <strong>M-x scroll-all-mode</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Scroll other window:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>M-C-v</strong> scrolls down</p></li>
<li><p><strong>M-C-V</strong> scrolls up</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat a command numerous times: <strong>M-(number) (command)</strong> where you fill in (number) with a number and (command) with the command that you want to repeat.  To use a number that is not a single digit you hold <strong>M</strong> while pressing the first number and then release <strong>M</strong> while pressing the rest of the numbers.  An example: to kill 10 lines you would do: <strong>M-1 0 C-k</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Notes:
<strong>M</strong> is the Meta key (usually Alt or Esc depending on your operating system/settings)
<strong>C</strong> is the Control key</p>

<p>Emacs can be great if you know how to use it.  :)</p>
