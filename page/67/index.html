  <div class="entry-content"><p>[uh-<strong>plom</strong>, uh-<strong>pluhm</strong>]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>Poise, composure, or self-assurance.</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>Having to process 1,000 cases in 2 hours was daunting to say the least, but she handled it with aplomb.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This word is a much more interesting word to use than others, and it seems to be somewhat colloquial in its rather specific uses.  Nonetheless it is an interesting word whose simple structure does not betray its true meaning to the uninitiated (translation: you probably can&rsquo;t figure out what it means if you don&rsquo;t already know what it means).  It&rsquo;s usually used when talking about facing difficult circumstances.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are disasters all over the world, but somehow when there&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s closer to home, it changes your perspective.  So apparently the fire that has been going on today in Anaheim Hills is actually not all too far away from home.  In fact, El Modena High School is one of the shelters, and that school is in my distract.  As a matter of fact it&rsquo;s probably only 5-10 minutes away!</p>

<p>It makes you think about how things are.  Our lives are based on so much that is simply temporary.  When something changes and we are left with whatever we are left with, then we are left with the choice to decide what is truly important in our life.  What will we choose?  Some of us will choose to pursue a life of pleasure (whether that means obtain &ldquo;things&rdquo; or satisfying oneself somehow).  Some of us will decide that life isn&rsquo;t worth it anymore.  Some of us will continue on doing what we think that we are supposed to be doing just as we have been doing all of our lives (not considering the reason or logic to why we do it all).  Some of us will attempt to live for &ldquo;something greater&rdquo; (whatever that may entail).  No matter what, it is intriguing to think about the fact that we are not the same once we are under duress.  As it is, a fairly insignificant percentage of people in the United States are actually under hardships such as these that make them re-evaluate their lives.  Have you ever thought about it?</p>

<p>Changes are not usually easy.  Some are even more difficult.  I&rsquo;d rather not waste my life, thank you very much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading a Los Angeles Times article similar in content to <a href="http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2007/03/08/News/Facebook.Group.Lands.Usc.Football.Player.In.Hot.Water-2764591.shtml?reffeature=recentlycommentedstoriestab">this</a> article, I knew that I just had to make some comments about it.  In this politically correct country where everyone has their say and is entitled to their rights, there are many people who think that it&rsquo;s all very outlandish and ridiculous.  And not in the funny or amusing way.  I am one of those people.</p>

<p>Granted, I don&rsquo;t think that creating a facebook about the &ldquo;Arian [sic] nation&rdquo; is necessarily something great.  But it&rsquo;s obviously a joke and to make such a big deal about it is absurd.  They were printed in the LA Times, for crying out loud!  Ridiculous.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest with you.  I can&rsquo;t stand people that blow things out of proportion like that.  They get hung up on the smallest things, but they have no idea that they are missing the big picture.  How did this politically correct trend begin?  Was it women&rsquo;s suffrage, or black rights, or what?  I have no idea because I&rsquo;m no history buff or even well-versed in politics, but all I know is that it&rsquo;s irritatingly everywhere.</p>

<p>I propose that these people just quit acting like their feelings were hurt and get a sense of humor.  I&rsquo;ve read that one (of two) of the worst things to hear is that you are humorless and cannot take a joke.  Well that is what I&rsquo;m saying to this Stefanie Gopaul.  Live a little and quit living your life by riding off the lives of those around you.</p>

<p>Great, another rant.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>
Haha I can&rsquo;t believe that I messed up the HTML so badly that the link wasn&rsquo;t showing!  People must think that I sounded crazy talking about an article that they couldn&rsquo;t even read.  How lame of me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So there are many people out there who watch this show.  I would just like to say that I am both disappointed and satisfied with it this week.  I actually don&rsquo;t like watching the results show because I think that it&rsquo;s a bit of a waste of time to convey the results in an hour long (or whatever length it is) show.  They use music and dramatic lighting to manufacture something out of nothing, and it is thoroughly annoying.</p>

<p>I thought that Jared was good.  He sounded like Marvin Gaye!  I thought that Sanjaya kid should definitely have been voted off.  He annoys me.  I think it&rsquo;d be cool if they had 2 numbers for each contestant, one for voting &ldquo;for&rdquo; and one for voting &ldquo;against&rdquo;.  They could take the result of that and use it.</p>

<p>At the same time I&rsquo;m glad that Antonella got voted off even though she might have had some questionable photos posted online (which made her a huge topic of search on the Internet).  It proves that there is some decency to the singing aspect of the show (because she was frankly not that great).</p>

<p>I kind of wonder what happens with these people when they return back from American Idol.  Do they just become another &ldquo;one of us&rdquo; who has had their 15 minutes of fame?  Or do any of them actually get to do something related to singing?  I&rsquo;m thinking that some of these people will revel in their temporary spotlight and always bring it up as they&rsquo;re becoming a lounge singer or something.  And then there will be (there have to be) some that still aspire for more and end up &ldquo;making it&rdquo; in some other way (be it a band or a contract or whatever).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s no doubt that the people that i meet in life can somehow scale to the world at large in some way.  That&rsquo;s a scary thought when I realize that the man who goes into the bathroom stall next to me didn&rsquo;t use a toilet seat cover.  Why is that scary?    It&rsquo;s scary because that means that man also very likely will not be that concerned about washing his hands thoroughly (if at all).  So why do I care if this guy (who I have no idea who he is) has dirty nasty hands?  Well because he is representative of lots and lots of people!  There are scores of people walking around out there that similarly don&rsquo;t care about keeping their butts from being disgustingly touched by countless other butts.  There are scores of people who similarly will not care about how clean their hands are.  And odds are, some of those people&rsquo;s hands will affect me.  Be it the fact that they&rsquo;re preparing my food or that they&rsquo;re going to shake my hand, they will affect me.  So you see, it affects us all.  There are so very many things that we do that are not just our business.  Drinking and driving, sneezing, not turning on our car lights at dusk, AND SO ON AND SO ON!</p>

<p>Amazing.  And scary.</p>
