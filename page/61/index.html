  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">feedburner</a> for stats on my website lately.  It&#8217;s just a little bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Javascript</a> added to the templates.  Pretty simple.  Except it wasn&#8217;t working today!  It kept showing 0 visitors when I know for SURE that there were visitors (like me!).  What&#8217;s going on??</p>

<p>Of course <a href="http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427">Kiki</a> noticed that my theme had changed to the default earlier this morning.  I&#8217;m not sure what was going on, but it might perhaps be related to that?  Anyways the change caused me to look for something else out there that could help me out.  I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com">site meter</a> before but I don&#8217;t like how there&#8217;s a little icon when you add the code to your page (although now that I think about it, I realize that I know a lot more about HTML and Javascript now compared to when I added that code to <a href="http://www.xanga.com/keleka">my xanga</a> so I could easily just remove the image and retain the functionality.  But that&#8217;s a moot point now).</p>

<p>So I found <strong><a href="http://www.statcounter.com">statcounter</a></strong> which seems to work very well.  There&#8217;s more information gathered and available than at sitemeter and it&#8217;s more real-time than feedburner was.  So I&#8217;m pretty happy with it thus far.</p>

<p>To make it even better because there&#8217;s apparently <a href="http://citizenk.wordpress.com/wp-plugins/statcounter-for-wordpress/">a sitecounter for wordpress plugin</a>!  That&#8217;s super!  (Note: I had to download <a href="http://download.almaren.ch/view.php?file=/code/wordpress/wp-plugins/statcounter/statcounter.php">the php page</a> itself because the zip file was linked incorrectly, but the installation was the same and went smoothly)</p>

<p>So I just thought you&#8217;d like to know that you&#8217;re being tracked a little bit.  Not as if you didn&#8217;t expect it.</p>

<p>I thought that the &#8220;blog&#8221; category needed another entry so that the &#8220;Rant&#8221; category could take a well-deserved break.  :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I talked to a co-worker a little bit yesterday as he was getting some coffee at the same time as I was heating up lunch in the microwave.  I asked him how much coffee he drinks a day.  I was amazed and kind of sickened when he said that he drinks 5-10 cups a day (where he would want to do 10 if it&#8217;s possible to get away from his desk).</p>

<p>Okay so maybe I wasn&#8217;t that sickened, but when he told me that at another job where he sat near the coffee pot (which was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew">drip style</a> coffee maker) and drank 3 pots a day I was definitely grossed out!  What in the world?!  I, of course, asked him if he felt effects from it, and he claimed that he did not.  But I don&#8217;t know if I believe him because that is just ridiculous.  Plus he then proceeded to talk about how if he drinks coffee with too much sugar he&#8217;ll crash from the sugar and get very short-tempered.</p>

<p>Wow, extremes like that usually seem pretty outlandish to other people, don&#8217;t they?  They do to me anyways.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know, there are a lot of things that are &#8220;bad&#8221; in this world.  Obviously sin is a pretty general answer.  But without even having to speak on the more heinous things such as actions warranting fines and felonies, we actually see and encounter many things everyday which are not very good at all.</p>

<p>Have you ever met someone who simply cares about nothing?  What a waste of a life!  To simply meander through life without truly being passionate or caring is such a tragedy.  To be scared to love simply because one has been hurt, to be scared to take sides simply because one is afraid to be wrong, to be scared of life simply to preserve it.  Well those people make me sad.  Is there something worse?</p>

<p>Well I&#8217;m not sure if I would say that it&#8217;s &#8220;worse,&#8221; but it&#8217;s definitely pretty high on my list of &#8220;bad things.&#8221;  Now some might disagree and that&#8217;s their prerogative.</p>

<p><strong>I think that having an opinion (especially a strong one) without any backing is pretty horrendous.</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve met people that will do this sometimes, but rarely have I truly experienced the full power of this shortcoming.  Nonetheless, a glimpse of it is all I need to see that I have a distaste for it.</p>

<p>Sure it&#8217;s horrible to not feel anything at all.  But it seems to me that it&#8217;s equally, if not more so, horrible to be swayed this way and that to the extremes without any concrete evidence to back it up.</p>

<p>What prompted me to this?  Well I&#8217;ll be honest and say that sometimes I read other people&#8217;s blogs.  I also enjoy reading xangas (even though my own is now just an extension of this blog).  I have a whole list of &#8220;subscriptions&#8221; to people that I&#8217;ve met over the years.  Some of them are friends that I still talk to, while others are not quite as near and dear to my heart anymore.  While reading an entry from one of these long-ago acquaintances about <a href="http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/">300</a>, I saw that they made a comment about how stupid it was to have all of these guys dressed how they were with such obscene amounts of computer assistance in making their bodies perfect.  Now, being someone who is into &#8220;knowing how things work,&#8221; I don&#8217;t even like how people can assume things about what computers can and cannot do without actually knowing about it (but that&#8217;s a topic for another entry).  Back to the example.  So the reason that reading this entry made me want to write this entry is because I <strong>also</strong> read about <a href="http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=35">the extensive workouts</a> that the actors, stunt doubles, and crew went through before the movie for four months to get the physique that they showed off in the movie.</p>

<p>Now what&#8217;s the big deal you ask?  Well it&#8217;s a big deal because it speaks of something deeper!  Just like hearing someone who is usually very &#8220;good&#8221; but will blurt out an expletive in a moment of anger speaks of deeper issues about just how &#8220;good&#8221; they really are, so also does this strong opinion about the faultiness of the whole production speak of some interesting traits in the opinion-holder.  I suggest people do a little research on their own before they speak of things which they have no idea about.  Else you will be thought foolish and ignorant by others.  And nobody wants to be a fool.  And you especially don&#8217;t want to be ignorant.</p>

<p>This is why I used to get irritated at people on <a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot</a> as well as why I can get irritated listening to IT people sometimes.</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>To be extremely wicked or evil.</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>The nefarious plan to set him up to take the fall for the murder has been going on for ages!</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>I like this word because you can use it for evil!  I mean literally.  Nefarious is so much more interesting to use than &#8220;evil&#8221; don&#8217;t you think?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Are you often awed by things that you see?  I am.  Whether seeing little kids bending and contorting in Chinatown or watching Kobe Bryant do his thing, I try to be amazed.</p>

<p>Can I first of all just say that Kobe Bryant is a pretty ridiculous basketball player?  For those that don&#8217;t follow the National Basketball Association, Kobe scored 65 points on Friday night and 50 points yesterday.  So that means in 2 games, Kobe has scored 115 points at the highest professional basketball level.  I question whether I&#8217;ve scored that many points in games in my entire life combined!  Now, if you add in all of the buckets for shooting around, I&#8217;m golden.  But can you believe this guy?  I can&#8217;t.  Was it a good idea to build the Lakers around him rather than <a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/shaquille_oneal/">Mr. O&#8217;Neal</a> ?  Well that kind of remains to be seen.  But that doesn&#8217;t detract from the fact that it&#8217;s amazing to watch him make turnaround 3-pointers while double-teamed as the shot clock is winding down and the game is on the line.  I had to construct a run-on sentence just to describe the whole scenario!</p>

<p>A little girl bending over backwards as only those in the circus can do?  Pretty amazing.  I don&#8217;t understand, sometimes, how others can have a body capable of such strange things.  I remember watching <a href="http://www.tv.com/guinness-world-records-primetime/show/10187/summary.html">Guinness World Records</a> and thinking that it was so amazing that there could be people out there that could fit into a tiny box (or whatever the amazing feat of the evening was).</p>

<p>And after seeing these amazing things over the weekend, I think:</p>

<p><em>I wonder what my most amazing feat will ever be.  I wonder if it has already happened.  Now that&#8217;s a sad thought.</em></p>
