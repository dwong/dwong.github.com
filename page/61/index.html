  <div class="entry-content"><p>While watching <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0325710/">The Last Samurai</a> again, I realized some interesting things.  Although Tom Cruise is fairly crazy as of late, this was definitely a good movie.  In this viewing anyways, I thought that it was insightful to see a leader who was willing to join in on the fight.  Contrast this with the leadership style of being perfectly willing to direct form the rear.</p>

<p>In that final scene where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsumoto">Katsumoto</a> (loosely based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigo_Takamori">Saigo Takamori</a>) and Nathan Algren (played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>) lead the final charge against the Imperial Army, you see the contrasting styles where Katsumoto and Algren ride their horses through the enemy while Omura (played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masato_Harada">Masato Harada</a>) stands on the hill helplessly trying to yell out orders for the gunmen to shoot their weapons.  If not for the superior (albeit seemingly cheating) technology that the Imperial Army had, all of the honor rode with the samurai.</p>

<p>Life has its share of similar incidents.  There are those people who are willing to get down and dirty versus those who love to direct others.  It&#8217;s the basic difference in thinking between those that want something done and those that will just go do it.  Now this is probably a slightly unfair description of the situation because I think that I tend to be of the latter variety most of the time.  And obviously <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/">I must think that I am right</a> about it.  But objectively, those of the other mindset will think that people like me rush into things too quickly and act too impulsively sometimes.  This is all true, but I digress.  (Read <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/01/algorithm-for-your-life/">this entry</a> to learn more about what I think)</p>

<p>Now what does this mean?</p>

<blockquote><p>If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s definitely an often heard phrase, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not true.</p>

<p>Lead by example, not by dictation.  Try it and you will find a spirit of self-reliance that you didn&#8217;t think possible.  And that is a good thing.</p>

<p>On another note: after a nice reprieve from the world as I know it, I&#8217;m back rested and with a little tan.  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[<strong>ten</strong>-uh-buh l]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>To be capable of being held or defended</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>That bunker over there is on higher ground, has a good vantage point of the attackers, and is thus definitely tenable.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This word can be used both as meaning to hold an actual place, but more commonly in our day and age it can be used to describe a side of an argument.  When someone has a better position in such an argument, their position could be described as tenable.  If you use it, people might nod and agree, but they&#8217;ll likely have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about.  Then you&#8217;ll feel like an all-star.  Unless of course they already know what it means, in which case you better make sure that you&#8217;re using it in the right context.</p>

<blockquote><p>The more uncommon a word is, the more horrible it is when used in the wrong context
-Derek Wong</p></blockquote>

<p>Haha I can&#8217;t believe that I just made up a quote and then quoted myself.  :P</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Imagine this:</p>

<p>You&#8217;re sitting on the toilet, as you probably do everyday.  You&#8217;re taking it easy for about 5 minutes as you release your body&#8217;s waste.  Then you look over.  There&#8217;s another stall next to you.  You look down.  Lo and behold!  What do you see?  A piece of dental floss!  &#8220;Well that&#8217;s strange,&#8221; you think.  What could dental floss possibly be doing in the bathroom.  Now there are a few possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Someone was flossing while they were sitting on the toilet.  After finished with it, they just dropped it on the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>Somehow there was some dental floss in some guy&#8217;s pocket and it came out as he was dropping them to sit on the toilet.  He had gone outside to take a &#8220;floss break&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>They were in his underwear because he keeps some dental floss there &#8220;just in case&#8221; (what that case is where he needs dental floss in his underwear is beyond the scope of this entry)</p></li>
<li><p>He ate some dental floss and it had come out the other end.  How did it get on the floor without stains?  Once again, beyond the scope of this entry.</p></li>
<li><p>Dental floss is raining from the bathroom ceiling</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">feedburner</a> for stats on my website lately.  It&#8217;s just a little bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Javascript</a> added to the templates.  Pretty simple.  Except it wasn&#8217;t working today!  It kept showing 0 visitors when I know for SURE that there were visitors (like me!).  What&#8217;s going on??</p>

<p>Of course <a href="http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427">Kiki</a> noticed that my theme had changed to the default earlier this morning.  I&#8217;m not sure what was going on, but it might perhaps be related to that?  Anyways the change caused me to look for something else out there that could help me out.  I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.sitemeter.com">site meter</a> before but I don&#8217;t like how there&#8217;s a little icon when you add the code to your page (although now that I think about it, I realize that I know a lot more about HTML and Javascript now compared to when I added that code to <a href="http://www.xanga.com/keleka">my xanga</a> so I could easily just remove the image and retain the functionality.  But that&#8217;s a moot point now).</p>

<p>So I found <strong><a href="http://www.statcounter.com">statcounter</a></strong> which seems to work very well.  There&#8217;s more information gathered and available than at sitemeter and it&#8217;s more real-time than feedburner was.  So I&#8217;m pretty happy with it thus far.</p>

<p>To make it even better because there&#8217;s apparently <a href="http://citizenk.wordpress.com/wp-plugins/statcounter-for-wordpress/">a sitecounter for wordpress plugin</a>!  That&#8217;s super!  (Note: I had to download <a href="http://download.almaren.ch/view.php?file=/code/wordpress/wp-plugins/statcounter/statcounter.php">the php page</a> itself because the zip file was linked incorrectly, but the installation was the same and went smoothly)</p>

<p>So I just thought you&#8217;d like to know that you&#8217;re being tracked a little bit.  Not as if you didn&#8217;t expect it.</p>

<p>I thought that the &#8220;blog&#8221; category needed another entry so that the &#8220;Rant&#8221; category could take a well-deserved break.  :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I talked to a co-worker a little bit yesterday as he was getting some coffee at the same time as I was heating up lunch in the microwave.  I asked him how much coffee he drinks a day.  I was amazed and kind of sickened when he said that he drinks 5-10 cups a day (where he would want to do 10 if it&#8217;s possible to get away from his desk).</p>

<p>Okay so maybe I wasn&#8217;t that sickened, but when he told me that at another job where he sat near the coffee pot (which was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew">drip style</a> coffee maker) and drank 3 pots a day I was definitely grossed out!  What in the world?!  I, of course, asked him if he felt effects from it, and he claimed that he did not.  But I don&#8217;t know if I believe him because that is just ridiculous.  Plus he then proceeded to talk about how if he drinks coffee with too much sugar he&#8217;ll crash from the sugar and get very short-tempered.</p>

<p>Wow, extremes like that usually seem pretty outlandish to other people, don&#8217;t they?  They do to me anyways.</p>
