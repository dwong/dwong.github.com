  <div class="entry-content"><p>Running has just become a part of my life. I hear others talk about how they think that it&#8217;s sheer craziness, and I know that I would have agreed at times in my life with that sentiment. But since my mind was changed around 7 years ago I have gone from <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/389/half-marathon/">my first half</a> to <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/596/finishing-my-first-marathon/">a full</a> and even starting to mix in a fair share of <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/631/barefoot-running/">barefoot running</a>. With this in mind I decided to do another half marathon with some friends from church.</p>

<p>This half marathon stands apart from the other races that I did because I believe that I did nearly all of my training for it barefoot. There might have been a couple of runs that I ran shod, but I don&#8217;t particularly remember them even when I ran in Boston, MA in November or during the cold temperatures here in Los Angeles, CA (~36 degrees Fahrenheit at night). In any case I was fairly set on trying to do this barefoot, but I hurt my heel on my very last tapered run 2 days before the race! I was trying to run on the street more since it was going to be a street race, but it did not go well. I am sure that there are errors in my form, and these will need to be addressed in the future. This started to give me some idea to what my problems were going to be for the race. The pain in my heel was slight, but I knew from past experience that any slight pain will be hugely magnified over the course of many miles. This made me start to doubt whether I would be able to finish the race barefoot.</p>

<p>The morning of the race went well. We all slept well and got up ready to go. I brought my shoes along just in case the conditions were unbearable, but I decided to leave them in the car when we finally got there. At the starting line I went up to the 8-9 minute/mile corral just before they started the race. The first mile along the boardwalk was grand since it was concrete, and I have plenty of concrete sidewalk experience. However near the first mile marker the course turned onto Venice Blvd. That first portion went decently even if there were some rough spots. Just to give you an idea from <a href="http://therunningbarefoot.com/?p=625s">Ken Bob&#8217;s Terrain Guide</a>, I had trained mostly on grades near 6 or 7 while the actual surface of those Santa Monica streets oftentimes warranted a 3 or 4.</p>

<p>In any case I continued on my merry way, doing okay until between miles 8 and 9. It was at that point that I was starting to feel the pain quite a bit, and it was affecting me a lot. I refused to stop or walk, but I was not doing well. Instead of passing people, I was starting to get passed. I won&#8217;t lie, it was rough going. The surface seemed to have gotten worse on the way back, but it could have just been that I was more sensitive after having run all of those other miles.</p>

<p>Those last 5 miles were torturous. I knew that I had to make it, and I knew that I could not stop. I reasoned with myself that stopping to walk just meant more time on my feet, and that was the last thing that I wanted at that point. I approached the end, thankfully, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that I picked it up in the last half of a mile as the finish line neared simply based on the fact that I was soon going to be able to get off of my feet. For the next 2 hours I was either sitting with my feet off of the pavement or hobbling uncomfortably because my feet were too tender to walk very far.</p>

<p>I did get to meet a nice older fellow who had run the race barefoot. He looked pretty comfortable as he was walking around afterward, but we chatted and he shook my hand in congratulating me on my first barefoot half marathon. I&#8217;m pretty sure that he thought that I was slightly foolish for only having run my longest barefoot run at ~10 miles prior to that race, though.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have too many pictures because honestly I only had 2 things on my mind. My right and my left feet. But the short story is:</p>

<ul>
<li>I did not train far enough in my distances.</li>
<li>I did not train on the correct surfaces.</li>
<li>I will be hobbling for a little while.</li>
<li><a href="http://results.active.com/pages/oneResult.jsp?pID=98847911&amp;rsID=105097&amp;pubID=3">I did it.</a></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Books are great.  They take us to far away lands and on many adventures.  They stimulate the mind and imagination to explore things that have been or things that could be.  But alas they are a dying form of entertainment it seems.</p>

<p>Even with the advent of the digital book reader (such as the <a href="http://amzn.to/Nxod9r">Amazon Kindle</a>), many people are moving towards more quickly gratifying forms of entertainment.  We want games immediately on our iPhone (even if it gives us <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/710/iphone-attention-deficit/">ADD</a>), we don&#8217;t want to waste a moment of possible entertainment so we watch videos in our cars, and we maintain the convenient connection with people through Facebook and <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/83/tweedle-dee-twitter-dumb/">Twittter</a> rather than actually interacting with them face-to-face.</p>

<p>Now it seems that lately people are progressing even further.  Many people cannot even walk around without rocking some tunes.  They do this when they&#8217;re by themselves, with their family, or even with their friends!  While this seems to be more prevalent with teenagers, I have seen it with others as well.  Is it the incessant need to be entertained?  Is it the desire to shut out the world to live in one&#8217;s own fantasy?  I daresay that while these might be true, it is actually because everyone simply wants to be the hero!</p>

<p>Movies always have a soundtrack, and it is especially apparent during the monumental scenes.  What kind of a movie would it be if there was not music playing as the hero rescues the captive while avoiding 2 dragons, 10 soldiers, and a huge boulder?!  The music helps the audience experience the emotion and excitement.</p>

<p>So kids these days.  They should be commended.  They just want to be the hero and do good in the world.  Or maybe they just need a jolt of extra emotion in their lives, which is probably good because many accuse them of a lack of passion.  In any case, maybe we should all just give a kid with headphones on a high five.</p>

<p><em>Unless, of course, they&#8217;re playing the villain&#8217;s track.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Crispy. Yeah that&#8217;s something that I can work with. I have started to enjoy photographing food. Possibly because I enjoy food, and I want to in some way remember the experience of good food. So while I will not ever be able to share the taste and smells of the food, I can at least share the visuals. Sometimes the food looks even better in the photos than in real life!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are plenty of loud people in the world.  That is not surprising.  But it is surprising when Crom is loud in the bathroom because I am of a particular opinion that most people try to be discrete there.  And he can do this no matter what he is doing in the bathroom.</p>

<p>He will walk in loudly as if he is in a rush.  He whistles and hums.</p>

<p>As he is urinating it is as if he is using all of his might to expel the liquid from his system.  Oddly enough, it seems as if there is air in the line since it will go full force then halt entirely then back to full force.  Even more odd is the fact that I have always thought that going full force (as he does) would result in more splash-back (if you know what I mean).  After expelling the liquid, he seems to like to let out a loud sigh of relief.  The sound makes me think that he is being intimate with the urinal.  That is just the sound that I want to be hearing from him.  Ew.  Just ew.  After that I sometimes <em>very</em> unfortunately do <strong>not</strong> hear the sound of the faucet.  Quadruple ew.</p>

<p>Now on the other hand, there are times when he poops.  I mean, <a href="http://amzn.to/Rs69nc">everyone does</a>.  And those times are pretty loud as well.  But that&#8217;s because he pushes that stuff out of his butt with as much force as he can.  At least that&#8217;s what it seems like!  I can also discern that there is no toilet seat cover or toilet paper used to cover the seat.  Good thing he washes his hands after using the stall.</p>

<p>Welcome to the bathroom world of Crom.  It is a very unpleasant place for the rest of us.  He probably does not know about <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/176/on-bathroom-behavior/">some of my opinions about the bathroom</a>.</p>
