  <div class="entry-content"><p>Crispy. Yeah that&#8217;s something that I can work with. I have started to enjoy photographing food. Possibly because I enjoy food, and I want to in some way remember the experience of good food. So while I will not ever be able to share the taste and smells of the food, I can at least share the visuals. Sometimes the food looks even better in the photos than in real life!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are plenty of loud people in the world.  That is not surprising.  But it is surprising when Crom is loud in the bathroom because I am of a particular opinion that most people try to be discrete there.  And he can do this no matter what he is doing in the bathroom.</p>

<p>He will walk in loudly as if he is in a rush.  He whistles and hums.</p>

<p>As he is urinating it is as if he is using all of his might to expel the liquid from his system.  Oddly enough, it seems as if there is air in the line since it will go full force then halt entirely then back to full force.  Even more odd is the fact that I have always thought that going full force (as he does) would result in more splash-back (if you know what I mean).  After expelling the liquid, he seems to like to let out a loud sigh of relief.  The sound makes me think that he is being intimate with the urinal.  That is just the sound that I want to be hearing from him.  Ew.  Just ew.  After that I sometimes <em>very</em> unfortunately do <strong>not</strong> hear the sound of the faucet.  Quadruple ew.</p>

<p>Now on the other hand, there are times when he poops.  I mean, <a href="http://amzn.to/Rs69nc">everyone does</a>.  And those times are pretty loud as well.  But that&#8217;s because he pushes that stuff out of his butt with as much force as he can.  At least that&#8217;s what it seems like!  I can also discern that there is no toilet seat cover or toilet paper used to cover the seat.  Good thing he washes his hands after using the stall.</p>

<p>Welcome to the bathroom world of Crom.  It is a very unpleasant place for the rest of us.  He probably does not know about <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/176/on-bathroom-behavior/">some of my opinions about the bathroom</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You might be surprised to know that I actually know that I do not know everything.  People who personally interact with me sure are.  Even more likely, they flat out refuse to believe it.</p>

<p>But I am confident that I am not delusional.  I know that I do not know everything.  So yes, I am confident when I think that I know something (<a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/5/algorithm-for-your-life/">as most people are</a>), but I also have seen enough to know that there is a vast amount of things that I have no idea about.</p>

<p>When I was learning how to drive, I did not give too much credit to my parents when they told me that experience matters in determining how good of a driver I was.  I thought that as long as I knew and followed the correct procedures, I would be just fine.  But I was wrong.  Surprise, surprise; experience really does matter.</p>

<p>Having the chance to actually see and try things for yourself is priceless.  There is absolutely no substitute for experience.  It gives you a warranted confidence that you know and can handle whatever it is that you are doing again.  Experience involves getting up close and personal with tasks.  You get to see (and hopefully get through) hiccups.  You get to see the whole process through to the end and learn lessons from first-hand knowledge.</p>

<p>So when someone is giving me <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/781/unsolicited-advice/">unsolicited advice</a> about a project or task, my immediate response is needing to know whether they have actually done it themselves.  I do not want to know if they understand what to do, have seen it done by someone else, or have read manuals about it.  I want to know if that adviser has actually done it.  If so, they have some credibility in my mind.  If not, their words might as well be &#8220;Wah wah wah.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Growing up (maybe just because it was growing up in the United States of America), I have become accustomed to getting gifts.  There are presents for birthdays, graduations, Christmas, and other events that society deems worthy.  There are all kinds of gifts, too.  There are handmade gifts, clothes, toys, service coupons (e.g., breakfast in bed), simple cards, gift cards, and even the classic dollar bill(s).</p>

<p>As a child I used to enjoy getting money as much (and probably more than) any other type of gift.  It is of the utmost in practicality since it can be used for anything that the receiver desires.  It is also much easier on the giver since it removes all of the effort involved in finding and purchasing a gift.</p>

<p>But I think, as a receiver of gifts, therein lies the reason why my embrace of money has declined as I have aged.  There is no work on the part of the giver.  Actually I should take that back because they do have to work at a job in order to actually receive that money.  But a giver of money does <strong>not</strong> need to wonder about the recipient&#8217;s desires or tastes.  They do not need to go out searching for an appropriate gift that will delight.  I appreciate the work that is involved in all of that.  (Even if, sometimes, the gift turns out to be awful.  If that is the case, I indeed would probably prefer money, but I can still try to appreciate the work and attempt that the giver made.)</p>

<p>Which leads me to my method of dealing with monetary gifts.  I can happily receive such a gift, but I also try my best to set aside that money and use it on something pleasant.  In that way, I can tangibly interact with the gift that has been given to me.  I find that it makes me much more thankful to have, say, a room fan rather than $50 in my pocket that will be spent over time on miscellaneous soon-forgotten expenses (e.g., parking meter).  The fan can cool me on a summer night.  The $50?  Not nearly as well.</p>

<p>In any case, can it really hurt any of us to be more thankful people?</p>
