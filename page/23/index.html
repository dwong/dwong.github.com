  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I&#8217;m driving around, I definitely notice when someone has Christian paraphernalia on their vehicle.  This can range anywhere from a fish emblem to the more clever slogans to mysterious symbols that are a little more difficult to deduce.  While I probably like seeing their proclamations of faith more than <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/11/sell-your-porsche/">other things</a>, it can still lead to pretty interesting results.</p>

<p>A little while back I saw a van in and around Los Angeles, CA with the slogan: <strong><em>God&#8217;s way is the best way</em></strong></p>

<p>The van was for a company that cleaned carpets named Best Way Carpet Clean.  In addition to the above slogan, they also had some fish stickers on their van.  Oh and there was a website listed on the van, but it seemed to be out of commission when I tried to access it.</p>

<p>In any case, what is the real motivation for them to put that on their van?  Seems to me that it is either because they hope:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It will get them business because people are Christian and they&#8217;ll trust another Christian</p></li>
<li><p>Non-Christians will think that Christians are more trustworthy so they&#8217;ll be hired</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Whatever the reason, it seems to me that unless they made a special deal with God to miraculously clean carpets for them, it doesn&#8217;t have too much of a place in that environment.  Not on their work van.  As it is, it just seems like a ploy to get more business and hence make more money.</p>

<p>Lesson is: be a Christian anywhere (even <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/29/christian-rap/">as a rapper</a>), but don&#8217;t do it out of incorrect motives.  Even if we can&#8217;t figure it out, someone already knows when you have false intentions (where that someone is God).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I think that now I&#8217;m okay after upgrading my version of Wordpress (via <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>) to 2.7.  Let me say that the new Dashboard (the part that the site owner looks at) is pretty darn nice now.  You can drag and drop things, and it has all kinds of AJAX goodness.</p>

<p>But I also had some difficulties while upgrading.  Namely, I had to fiddle a bit to get everything working alright.  I&#8217;d been using Brian&#8217;s Threaded Comments, and the move from that to the new baked-in threaded comments wasn&#8217;t too hard.  I just needed to update my theme, which is thankfully a custom one that I wrote so I know the ins and outs of it.  So I made a new comments page that looks fairly similar to what it looked like before.  The threading was maintained on old posts, and I definitely count it a success.</p>

<p>Then I realized today that my commenting isn&#8217;t working!  While using Brian&#8217;s Threaded Comments, I had been using a custom comment posting page to hinder spam.  However that meant that I wasn&#8217;t using the normal page.  So when I switched to the normal page (wp-comment-post.php), it wasn&#8217;t working!  I had to realize that the &#8220;Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by &#8230;&#8221; error was because I had some extra lines in the aforementioned comment posting page.  Removed those, and all is well.</p>

<p>So if you tried to comment recently and that didn&#8217;t work for you, I apologize.</p>

<p>But now that I think that I&#8217;m all good, I can enjoy how nice this new version is.  You won&#8217;t be able to tell because it looks the same to you, but if you&#8217;re thinking about blogging then consider <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> (if you don&#8217;t have a server) and <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress.org</a> (if you do have your own server).</p>

<p>If you have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, then good day to you, and I hope that you&#8217;re doing well.  Cheer up, at least gas is approaching $1.50 per gallon (it was $1.66 at Costco when I got it this morning).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you alter someone&#8217;s mood and behavior so that they become a monster?  What&#8217;s the secret to finding out what they&#8217;re really like?</p>

<p>A box.  Yes, put them into a box.  Of course, most of us don&#8217;t want to be put into a box because we feel that it inhibits who we are.  We don&#8217;t want others to define us.  And that makes sense.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m talking about a metal box.  In fact it&#8217;s a metal box that rolls around.  And when you put someone inside you get to see their rage, impatience, and overall self-centered nature.  It&#8217;s like releasing The Incredible Hulk, without all of that gamma mess.  It really is pretty shocking.</p>

<p>When you use the box, you will get to see how people love to do things for themselves.  In particular, they like to cut in line.  Can you imagine if they did that to you while waiting in line at the bank?  Perhaps when the teller says, &#8220;Next,&#8221; they will jump the line and just go up.  What kind of an uproar would that cause?  I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;d meet with some fairly vocal outrage.  But in the metal box?  It all comes out.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/">love</a> <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/27/on-driving/">writing</a> about this.  That&#8217;s what happens when you see it everyday!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you&#8217;re out and about, you might happen upon people that are moving to sound.  Yes yes, in life you might see dancing.  Whether in the club or at an organized school dance or at a wedding or in your house, dancing has a way of getting to people.  Some more than others.</p>

<p>Is it just me or does it always seem like people like to develop into circles when they&#8217;re dancing in groups?  And where there is a circle, there will eventually be someone in the mush pot.  It also seems like there is a particular type of person that always ends up in the middle.  Maybe they like the attention.  Maybe they&#8217;re trying to impress a special someone.  Or maybe they just love a little space while they&#8217;re busting their moves.  Everyone who&#8217;s not in the circle?  I think that they like the circles because they can be entertained without having to actually dance.</p>

<p>Me?  I say no to circles!  Fun for all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aren&#8217;t bathrooms full of such interesting happenings?</p>

<p>In the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290002/">Meet the Fockers</a> as Bernie Focker is giving everyone a tour of their house, he eventually gets to the bathroom.  When he&#8217;s there, he tells them the rule of the house is</p>

<blockquote><p>If it&#8217;s yellow let it mellow, if it&#8217;s brown flush it down.
-Bernie Focker</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that I&#8217;m working with someone who has taken that to heart.</p>

<p>No, scratch that.  Some of them don&#8217;t even flush it down.  Decency people, decency!</p>
