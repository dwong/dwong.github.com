  <div class="entry-content"><p>I enjoy a board (or sometimes card or tile) game just as much as anyone else.  They are good clean fun that often test particular skills and attributes.  There are games like scrabble and speed scrabble, which test your vocabulary and literacy; chess, which tests your planning capabilities; and Nertz, which tests speed and awareness.</p>

<p>While I enjoy the games, I do not always enjoy the people that play the games.  I mean what is up with people that take games too seriously?  Games are fun, and I will play as hard as I can.  But it is never appealing when things get out of hand.</p>

<p>In particular there are some games that I cannot stand playing with other people because they tend to get much too involved in them.  <a href="http://www.catan.com/">Settlers of Catan</a> is one of those games.  Since so much of the game is the relationships between the players in the game, it is extremely susceptible to antagonism, back-stabbing, and bitterness.  All lovely attributes.  It is an excellent game if you want to see the ugly in people, that&#8217;s for sure.  People cannot help but reveal themselves a little bit when it gets competitive.</p>

<p>I will always remember a friend that I knew who was willing to give up a game (in that case basketball) because he was enticed to behave badly while playing.  He thought that there were more important things in the world, namely his Christianity, so he gave it up.  Admirable and encountered far too little nowadays.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t really find it too difficult that people can easily say one thing while doing another.  While <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/5/algorithm-for-your-life/">everyone thinks that they&#8217;re right</a>, it seems like it&#8217;s getting easier (in this increasingly relativistic society) for people to change their mind after committing.  They think that they&#8217;re right even when they go back on what they have previously said.  They just rationalize away the facts.</p>

<blockquote><p>A man is only as good as his word</p></blockquote>

<p>This saying is often used, and it is one that has stuck with me over the years.  Let&#8217;s face it, nobody appreciates someone who backpedals when the going gets tough.  Neither friends, family, or employer will ever enjoy someone whose word is unreliable.</p>

<p>If you find that you&#8217;re in an un<a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/142/tenable/">tenable</a> position because you overextended, perhaps you should have thought about it before you extended.  When you are out there, you have to deal with the consequences.  Next time remember to calculate the cost before giving your word.  You just might be a better man (or woman, obviously) for it.</p>

<p>It seems like it is time to man up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s rather obvious that there isn&#8217;t anyone in the world that knows all of the other people in the world.  It is therefore logical to conclude that each person will encounter strangers.  Some people are good at talking to and interacting with them while others are completely unable to do it.  Whether it is in line at the grocery store, waiting at the post office, going to a friend&#8217;s party (where there are some people that you know and some that you don&#8217;t), or sitting at a wedding banquet, it&#8217;s pretty easy to see how you handle strangers.</p>

<p>And I find it rather strange that sometimes it&#8217;s actually easier to talk to strangers than it is to talk to people that you already know, especially those that you have not interacted with in awhile, and it&#8217;s especially true for those that you only know superficially.  With people that you knew before, it seems like it gets awkward after the initial greeting whereas (depending on the strangers) it can be much more enjoyable to find out about a person from the start as the conversation continues.</p>

<p>In my case, I often hope <strong>not</strong> to have to talk to people that I know superficially previously, especially in situations that will span a considerable time (like the aforementioned wedding banquet scenario).  It is worlds less awkward to talk to strangers.</p>

<p>Although if the stranger is out to rob, punch, or otherwise do harm to me I reserve the right to prefer a person that I know superficially.  And if the stranger is dull and uninteresting, then I also reserve the right to hate talking to the stranger.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I could have your attention, I would rather like to quickly rant about something that I see all of the time.</p>

<ol>
<li>People pay for their own domain name</li>
<li>Those same people want to get e-mail</li>
<li>Those people proceed to register an e-mail address with some free webmail (e.g., Yahoo!, Google, etc)</li>
</ol>


<p>Why does require a rant?  Because they paid for their own domain!  Instead of having to register SomeOrganizationSomeGroup@gmail.com, they could very well just decide that they want to get SomeGroup@TheirDomain.com.  Doesn&#8217;t that seem more appealing?  Isn&#8217;t that more professional and more enjoyable?  Yes, yes I think that we can all agree to that.</p>

<p>The only argument that I can think of is that people want to be able to use the webmail clients to access their e-mail.  I hear ya.  But maybe more importantly, Google hears ya.  I don&#8217;t want to be a Google salesman, but their <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">standard edition of Google Apps</a> is pretty free.  And that will pretty much take care of you.</p>

<p>Together, we can combat annoying-to-remember e-mail addresses.  We can do it!</p>
