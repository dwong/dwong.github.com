  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s rather obvious that there isn&#8217;t anyone in the world that knows all of the other people in the world.  It is therefore logical to conclude that each person will encounter strangers.  Some people are good at talking to and interacting with them while others are completely unable to do it.  Whether it is in line at the grocery store, waiting at the post office, going to a friend&#8217;s party (where there are some people that you know and some that you don&#8217;t), or sitting at a wedding banquet, it&#8217;s pretty easy to see how you handle strangers.</p>

<p>And I find it rather strange that sometimes it&#8217;s actually easier to talk to strangers than it is to talk to people that you already know, especially those that you have not interacted with in awhile, and it&#8217;s especially true for those that you only know superficially.  With people that you knew before, it seems like it gets awkward after the initial greeting whereas (depending on the strangers) it can be much more enjoyable to find out about a person from the start as the conversation continues.</p>

<p>In my case, I often hope <strong>not</strong> to have to talk to people that I know superficially previously, especially in situations that will span a considerable time (like the aforementioned wedding banquet scenario).  It is worlds less awkward to talk to strangers.</p>

<p>Although if the stranger is out to rob, punch, or otherwise do harm to me I reserve the right to prefer a person that I know superficially.  And if the stranger is dull and uninteresting, then I also reserve the right to hate talking to the stranger.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I could have your attention, I would rather like to quickly rant about something that I see all of the time.</p>

<ol>
<li>People pay for their own domain name</li>
<li>Those same people want to get e-mail</li>
<li>Those people proceed to register an e-mail address with some free webmail (e.g., Yahoo!, Google, etc)</li>
</ol>


<p>Why does require a rant?  Because they paid for their own domain!  Instead of having to register SomeOrganizationSomeGroup@gmail.com, they could very well just decide that they want to get SomeGroup@TheirDomain.com.  Doesn&#8217;t that seem more appealing?  Isn&#8217;t that more professional and more enjoyable?  Yes, yes I think that we can all agree to that.</p>

<p>The only argument that I can think of is that people want to be able to use the webmail clients to access their e-mail.  I hear ya.  But maybe more importantly, Google hears ya.  I don&#8217;t want to be a Google salesman, but their <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">standard edition of Google Apps</a> is pretty free.  And that will pretty much take care of you.</p>

<p>Together, we can combat annoying-to-remember e-mail addresses.  We can do it!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some help for understanding this snippet of Python programming code.  While you are unmarried, you are either dating someone or you are not.  If you&#8217;re not dating and happen to find someone that you want to date, then lucky you!  The next categorization is you are either actively pursuing marriage or you are not.  If you are, I think that you should want to go on interesting dates.</p>

<p>Life isn&#8217;t dinner and a movie.  Life is crazy and uncertain.  It&#8217;s hard and difficult.  Don&#8217;t you want to see how the person that you might spend the rest of your life with reacts?  When they&#8217;re fording a river, do they get angry and upset with you?  When you&#8217;re lost in the wilderness, do they get upset and frustrated?  When you get frustrated with them, do they snap back?  Find the worst in the person.  Look for it as hard as you possibly can.  Because if you can handle the worst, then you can definitely handle the best.</p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t as actively pursuing marriage then enjoy your dinner and movie.</p>

<p>And if you&#8217;re not dating then good luck with being on your own and all of the issues entailed in CT&#8217;s <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/august/16.22.html">The Case For Early Marriage</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Labor unions have their origins as recently as the 18th century and in the United States of America in the 19th century.  Quite simply a union is an entity that represents the collective interests of its members, often associated with workers of a similar profession.  They were extremely important in yesteryear when &#8220;the Man&#8221; would snuff the very life out of people with his unyielding desire for more profit, even at the expense of people&#8217;s lives.  Unions were an answer to this vileness.  They allowed the workers to stand united against injustice and fight for their rights as human beings.</p>

<p>But now <em>they</em> are getting despicable.</p>

<p>In striving for (or at least claiming to strive for) the best possible situations for its members, the power-hungry leaders of unions are wielding weapons that they seem ill-equipped to handle.  They know only to grab all that they can at no expense.  There are so many different groups reaching for as much as they possibly can that they threaten the very structures upon which they stand!</p>

<p>Unions make it easy for people to get as much as they can while also being protecting from punishment for not doing their job.  Do you think that it&#8217;s a coincidence that the automakers in Detroit have huge unions and are also now going bankrupt?  What about the education system (especially locally in southern California) that is floundering for money?  Those teacher unions sure are big and powerful, aren&#8217;t they?  I say that if they had just been reasonable about what they wanted and did (e.g., protecting from unjust terminations instead of deserved terminations) then perhaps we all would be a little bit better off.</p>

<p>In the United States of America, we stand for things.  Our Constitution says that we have rights.  But those rights do not include a guaranteed source of income nor a completely secure job.  We are not entitled to a house nor do we deserve free health care, but I digress.  Our rights do include the ability to work as hard as you can to achieve things.  And in our current society, it sure seems like we could get ride of unions and let the best of the workers survive (because they will always be sought after as good workers).</p>
