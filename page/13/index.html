  <div class="entry-content"><p>As the weather warms up, I start to see more people out and about getting their exercise on.  That is, they&rsquo;re either getting out of the stuffy gym for some sunshine or they are actually realizing that it is nice to be outside instead of sitting on the couch.  Whatever their reason, it is good to see them out there.</p>

<p><strong>Unless of course they are old.</strong>  Yeah, that is probably an ageist statement no matter how you slice it.</p>

<p>Anyways, my whole point is that an old person should not be running in 85Â° F heat with either a plastic suit or a sweatshirt/sweatpants on.  There are some things that are good and important (like exercise).  There is also a fair amount of wisdom in knowing when to take it 100% and when to err on the safe side.  A young guy trying to sweat out some water to make weight for high school wrestling can take the plastic suit a little better than an older gentleman in his 60s who is just trying to slim down for the ladies at the retirement home.</p>

<p>So remember, friends don&rsquo;t let friends let their grandparents go on a crash diet to get ready for cage fighting.  What, cage fighting?  Yeah that definitely seems like the only reasonable place for anyone over the age of 22 (i.e., post-collegiate wrestling) to wear a plastic suit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29">war</a>, here is a fun little game that was concocted by yours truly.  In keeping with finding out the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/773/the-origin-of-things/">origin of things</a>, this took place at the winter retreat of the Hi Koi fellowship in December 2007.  Anyways, the game adds the mindlessness of war with punishments and randomness that will amuse you to no end.  It is good clean fun!  And it happens to be good for you!</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>At least 1 deck of cards</li>
<li>2+ players</li>
<li>1 cup for each player</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>
Deal all of the cards to each player (as in war).  Players are not to look at their cards.  Play occurs in rounds (&ldquo;battles&rdquo;) with each player revealing the top card in their pile.  The highest card (ace is high) is the winner.  All players with cards lower than the highest relinquish their card to the player with the highest card as well as drink an arbitrarily small amount of water (i.e., a sip).  If the 2 players have equally high cards, they are now to engage in a &ldquo;war&rdquo; with each player placing their top 3 cards facedown and revealing the 4th card.  This continues until one of the players engaged in the &ldquo;war&rdquo; has a higher card.  The loser of the war must relinquish all cards as well as drink the rest of the water in their cup.  Once a player has lost all of their cards, they are eliminated.  Each loser must drink the number of cups of water relative to their standing (i.e., the first person eliminated with 6 players has a standing of 6th and will then drink 6 cups of water).</p>

<p><strong>Alternate Versions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Winner must drink the water</li>
<li>Use food instead of water</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Search for anything of substance, and you will find that it is quite easy to start believing that there is only one option that will satisfy.  And even though it is near impossible to tell whether you have exhausted all possibilities in the world, you know that you will immediately recognize that Perfect One.</p>

<p>The Perfect One is the ideal that you have in your mind of whatever it is that you are looking for.  It is going to be recognized and apparent.  You are sure of this.  Far be it from me to doubt that you could possibly know this for sure.</p>

<p>For example when you are dating, you are looking for the Perfect Boyfriend/Girlfriend.  If you are a little better at seeing the bigger picture, you are looking for the Perfect Husband/Wife.  But through the good and bad dates, you are evaluating the other person by holding them up against your ideal.  Once the other person does not match, you are going to move on.  Don&rsquo;t pay attention to the fact that the person would make a very good match for you despite being slightly too short.  Much more tragically than missing a good match in search of a perfect match, though, is being married to someone who you eventually believe to not be the perfect match.  When that happens, you might find that you have found the Perfect One in another person.  At the very least in this situation you are going to imagine the possibilities of a different life, and at the worst it can lead you to  pursue your fantasies.  This will obviously hurt many people around in addition to making you a liar (since you could not keep your vows).</p>

<p>Another instance when people look for the Perfect One is when they are house hunting.  When you are searching for a house, people often advise you that you will &ldquo;just know&rdquo; once you walk into a house.  That is rubbish.  It is just another way of saying that you should be looking for the Perfect House.  Forget the fact that you are looking at houses that would work out just fine.  And forget the fact that any house will have its problems.  Forget the fact that <strong>it&rsquo;s just a building</strong> that will not last!</p>

<p>The horrible thing about this mindset is not that you should have standards.  When someone fails to meet your standards for a mate or if a house is completely broken, you <em>should</em> move on.  That just makes sense.  However, the horrible thing about this mindset is that it will fool you into doing things that do not make any sense at all.  You will fall in love with the Perfect One with your heart but not with your head.  And then when (not if) reality comes in the form of imperfections, you will be horribly disappointed.  And it will hurt.</p>

<p>Can this be fixed?  Yes it can!  Today you can realize that there is no perfect one, whatever it is that you are looking for.  Realize that settling can be just a negative take on this and realize that settling is not always so bad.  Settle on something that is acceptable (this seems obvious but don&rsquo;t settle on something that is unacceptable).  If you do not settle, then at least start to believe that the Perfect One will never be found.  Move forward with the knowledge that you will NOT find the Perfect One.  And if the results match up to your expectations, you are much less likely to get into trouble.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Given enough time, we rather forget about the origin of things.  That reminds me of <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-reading/the-foundation-trilogy-by-isaac-asimov/">Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s Foundation Trilogy</a> where the novels are set thousands of years in the future, and the things that we know about now have by then become so far removed so as to be thought myth.  They could not fathom the planet that we live on, and they could barely remember that they had originated from Earth.</p>

<p>Even when we are not so far removed from the origin of things we begin to see disagreements about the facts.  As time moves on, opinions diverge.  Sometimes no opinion even leads to the truth.  Sometimes people become <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/10/fanaticism/">fanatical</a> about their opinions.  In any case, we can see this phenomenon here and now.</p>

<p>Give a new idea a couple of years, and it will be as if they had always existed.  Nicknames just need time before they become the preferred way of referencing things (case in point: not too many people could tell you that &ldquo;blog&rdquo; is actually just a chopped up version of &ldquo;web log&rdquo;).  Games are invented and taught to others with no regards as to why certain things are the way that they are.  It is amazing, really, to think of how much information we pass on without even stopping to think about where that information comes from.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the <em>most</em> important aspect would be the origin of information.  I know that I want to know if I can trust the source of information before I willingly pass it on.</p>

<p>Oh by the way, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_on_Me_%28song%29">Lean On Me</a> is a song by Bill Withers.  You cannot use it for worship.</p>
