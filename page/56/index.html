  <div class="entry-content"><p>When one is surfing the Internet, one does enjoy a way by which to navigate the wild wild Internet.  One might see content that is intriguing.  One would then want to peruse more of said content.  Well one is in luck!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sphere.com">Sphere.com</a> is a site whose goal is connecting people to related content.  From their site:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sphere is a startup from a handful of people passionate about connecting mainstream and conversational media content</p></blockquote>

<p>Anyways, a little while ago I added a cool <a href="http://www.sphere.com/tools#wpwidget">Sphere widget</a> to the bottom of each post.  Click on it (it won&#8217;t redirect you away from the page unless you click again) and you&#8217;ll see some (hopefully) related content.  And then this site will be just another stone in your stepping.  Anyways, hope that this is useful to you!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[<strong>ad</strong>-ij]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>Proverb, saying learned by experience</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>At work when the boss wasn&#8217;t in, we were all a little less productive.  I guess it&#8217;s just like the old adage goes, &#8220;When the cat is away, the mice will play.&#8221;</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>For some reason whenever I think of this word, I think that the word &#8220;old&#8221; should be prepended to it.  It&#8217;s just another way to say &#8220;proverb.&#8221;  Of course that is good because if you&#8217;re using this word then you probably know some proverb.  And that would mean that you&#8217;re wise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I happened on a site for <a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/">Career Development</a> a little while back (I believe from the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> homepage).  It caught my eye because they had an article on helping with your resume.  Now granted I already have a job, but I still remember what a pain it was to be searching for a job.  At the time, I didn&#8217;t have time to read the article on doing a resume makeover, but I bookmarked the page to read at a later time.  Boy am I glad that I did.</p>

<p>This site is run be a couple of people who have experience in corporate America.  They give both their thoughts as well as their advice on topics that might be of use to those of us who are also working in some way.  This ranges anywhere from the entrepreneurs to the low man on the totem pole.  They have tips on resume writing, on interviewing, as well as a myriad of other topics.  All of the posts are well thought out and fairly to the point (often consisting of lists).  It&#8217;s especially useful reading for those looking for a job.  Although the site as a whole reaches out to all of those of us who are working, individual posts aren&#8217;t always applicable.  But I suppose that wide spectrum of people in the audience dictates that as necessary.</p>

<p>Anyways, days after initially bookmarking the page I added the site to my RSS reader.  And as they say, I haven&#8217;t looked back since.</p>

<p>A few of my favorite posts thus far:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/03/simple-steps-on-how-to-write-a-resume/">Simple Resume Tips</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/24/6-resume-tips-for-seasoned-professionals/">Resume Tips For Seasoned Professionals</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/11/ways-to-save-one-dollar-a-week/">Money Saving Tips</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>They&#8217;re having <a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/05/03/review-career-ramblings-for-a-backlink/">a promotion where you link</a> to their site as well as write a review.  This essentially raises your online profile by providing their readers with a link to your site, and it also raises their ranking in search engines that use backlinks as a method by which to calculate &#8220;importance.&#8221;  This is fairly beneficial for both parties involved.  And even though they might have gotten the idea from a certain site about how to make money online by blogging ( ;-) ), I still think it&#8217;s a useful endeavor because this site is useful for nearly everyone out there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So just to let you know, I made a statistics page available for readers to peruse.  It lists general information such as how many posts and how many comments.  The most interesting statistic (in my opinion) is the list of the commentors and how many comments they have left.  However, I must admit that the commenting seems to be fairly unevenly weighted.  Does that make you want to do anything on my posts?  ;-)</p>

<p>In any case, check out the &#8220;Statistics&#8221; page in the navbar.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes Chinese people do good things.  Sometimes Chinese people do bad things.  And sometimes Chinese people sure do some stupid things.</p>

<p>Get this: Chinese people copied Disneyland.  As in, they made a Disneyland <strong>park</strong>.  Are you kidding me?!</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/04/keepin-it-real-fake-part-lv-disneyland/">an Engadget article about the fake Disneyland</a> that got me to searching for more information.  Amusingly, they have characters that closely mimic the Disney ones as well as rides that indicate how much of a fake it is.  Their slogan (according to <a href="http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=20&amp;art_id=41990&amp;sid=13078355&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20070411">this other article</a>) is that &#8220;Disneyland is too far.&#8221;  Wow, that is unbelievable.  I think that actually the most amusing thing about Beijing&#8217;s Shijingshan Amusement Park is that its website is <a href="http://www.bs-amusement-park.com">http://www.bs-amusement-park.com</a>.  Haha you read that right, it&#8217;s the BS amusement park.</p>

<p>Although pretty humorous, this actually touches on a more serious issue (which was touched on at <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/14/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/">Even Worse Than At First Glance</a>).  And that issue is copyright infringement (or in this case complete disregard for copyrights whatsoever).</p>
