  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe as a result of being out of school, I feel like I am somewhat out of the loop on the latest happenings.  When I was in school, <a href="http://www.xanga.com/">Xanga</a> was something that I knew about even before it got big.  Likewise with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and so on.  However, I feel as if I&#8217;ve been a little bit late learning about <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>For those in the know, you can probably skip this paragraph.  Basically Twitter is a new service that is meant for people to basically say what they are doing at a precise moment: now.  Whatever you are doing, Twitter is a way by which you can let others know what it is that you are doing.  You can do this via cellular phone (by way of text message), instant messenger, or on their website.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it.  Pretty simple right?  Well I think that it&#8217;s dumb.</p>

<p>There is lots to be said for what a marvelous job they have done using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_rails">Ruby on Rails</a> as the platform on which they developed their service.  I mean just imagine having to deal with possibly thousands and thousands of tiny connections every second.  The effort put into the software engineering is impressive to say the least.</p>

<p>However, I think that the service is fairly horrendous in terms of what it means for people.  There are some people out there who really do enjoy knowing about what all of their friends (and strangers for that matter) are doing every second of every day.  But I think that this is just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litmus">Litmus Test</a> for society as a whole.  In a society of cellular phones, <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/">Blackberrys</a>, and the like, we are forever on the go and busy.</p>

<p>I think that people need to take a step back and realize that it is so ridiculous to have all of these contraptions.  Sure I have a great admiration for the engineering and development that all of these products represent.  I even have a respect for the situations when they are actually necessary.  But in terms of actual worth for the great herd we call &#8220;the public&#8221;, I think they are fairly detrimental to the well-being of people.  Do you think that the people in the United States of America are any happier with their gadgets than tribesmen in some far off corner of the earth?  Well they might think so, but who&#8217;s to say?</p>

<p>Even more than happiness, I say that all of these things are making us constantly bored.  How can that be?  In so being always prone to want to fill the time with checking e-mail or answering the phone, we have become people that always need to do something.  And when we don&#8217;t have something to do, we are bored.</p>

<p>There are more important things, and I think that we all know this deep within.  Have you ever thought that spending time with those around you is more important than answering your cellular phone right away?  As I once heard</p>

<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s why voicemail was invented.</p></blockquote>

<p>E-mail is convenient and easy, but a letter is still desirable because of the fact that it takes time and energy to write one.  Think about these things the next time it comes up in your life.  I try to do so in mine.  I won&#8217;t interrupt a conversation just to answer the phone, and I know that there is a time and a place for when e-mail is appropriate.</p>

<p>Twitter is a cool product/service, but I for one think that it&#8217;s continuing in the grand tradition of leading humans down the wrong road.  It&#8217;s making us bored as we&#8217;re waiting for another instant Twitter update.  It makes us want to sit in front of the computer or stare at our cellular phone even more.  It is making people more connected to their devices and less connected to other people in a real, tangible manner.  Basically, <strong>Twitter is dumb</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/30/the-steampunk-mouse-and-the-mouse-mouse/">this post</a> on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a>, and I thought it suitably disturbing to write a post about it.</p>

<p>Check out the original article that Engadget is just reposting <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/EM1O9XJF0YPF7M5/">over here</a> at <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">Instructables.com</a> (which is a super site with lots of things for those of the DIY variety). There is an instruction video that will let you perform the same modification. However, I think that more people will just be interested in seeing what I&#8217;m talking about. So without further ado, here are some pictures!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/226/478636125_0ca99b18e7_m.jpg" alt="mouse_before" />
A glimpse of the parts beforehand. That&#8217;s nasty.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/217/478636119_3aea1e52e8_m.jpg" alt="mouse_done" />
Here is the finished product after inserting the (computer) mouse into the (real) mouse. Oh yum.
<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/185/478636121_f16d110447_m.jpg" alt="mouse_in_use" />
And here it is being used by someone&#8217;s hand. Who knows who that is. All I know is that I don&#8217;t want that to be my hand. And I don&#8217;t want to shake their hand either.</p>

<p>So there have some of the interesting pictures that I saw over at Instructables. That is disgusting, but I think that is still fairly cool. Why is that cool? Well just imagine how much <em>more</em> disgusted everyone else would be if they saw you use it. I could see how this could be the source of many many practical jokes. Find it gross, find it humorous, or find it useful. Whatever the case, it has to evoke some feelings in you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[<strong>en</strong>-mi-tee]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>Hatred, hostile feelings, extremely strong dislike</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>I thought that my sarcastic comments only made them feel slightly embarrassed, but in truth their feelings had turned into deep-seated enmity.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This is not in any way a long or strange word to most people.  However, I still think that it is not an often used word, especially when it can be used so much more colorfully than the favorite word &#8220;hatred.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just realized that this is the second article that is car-related within the past few days or so. Anyways, I just wanted to say that I am not getting a new car or am involved in the process at all. It&#8217;s mere coincidence.</p>

<p>Anyways, onward with the post.</p>

<p>So I don&#8217;t know about most people, but I do know about me. And one thing that I know is that I absolutely cannot stand it when I can&#8217;t figure something out. For example, I cannot stand it when I lose something because that is in essence a puzzle (the location of something) that I cannot figure out. It will consume me to no end!</p>

<p>So for the past couple of months, I have been slightly perturbed by a puzzle. No it&#8217;s not a puzzle in the normal sense. Basically I would drive around southern California and obviously see lots of cars. Now occasionally I would see something that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/213/473834904_46f6265569_o.jpg" alt="op.permit" />
I blurred out the important information because I just yanked the picture from some random site.</p>

<p>Now I always wondered what it was. Now obviously you can see what it is now because I found a picture for you and it&#8217;s not moving at 70 mph. But imagine it as something 6 inches square and on the back window of a car and moving exceptionally fast. Plus you don&#8217;t want to get too close to it else you might get into an accident! And although I would see them around some of the time, I never really saw them in a context by which I could actually look at it.</p>

<p>And so my mind imagined what it could be. Some of the things that I thought of were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#8217;s a secret club for something and that badge indicates that they&#8217;re in the club</p></li>
<li><p>My eyes were playing tricks on me</p></li>
<li><p>It was a new hip brand of clothing/auto accessories/whatever</p></li>
<li><p>It was a humorous bumper sticker type thing</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So basically my mind would stew about it for a few minutes every time that I saw one of these things. And this went on for a couple of months! Of course I tried to remedy this all by searching for it on the Internet, but you can imagine how hard it would be to find it. Basically all I knew was that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was red</p></li>
<li><p>It had a number on it</p></li>
<li><p>It was on the back of cars</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now those are some pretty broad and sweeping search terms by which my search engines could not help me with. Alas, I was to be forever confounded&#8230;</p>

<p>Until <strong>finally</strong> one Sunday I saw one of these on the back of a car in the parking lot of <a href="http://www.fcbc.org/">First Chinese Baptist Church</a>. I took the minute or so to read it and discovered that it&#8217;s a DMV Temporary Operating Permit! I promptly felt satisfaction seep over me like a gentle wave. :P But truly I do enjoy it when things make sense, and those moments when realization set in are very nice indeed.</p>

<p>Even with the knowledge of what these were, it was still hard to find information about them online. I must admit that I still don&#8217;t know all that there is to know about these, but I don&#8217;t really care that much anymore because I know <strong>what</strong> they are. Hopefully if someone is in the same conundrum as I was, they will happen upon this page and be satisfied as well.</p>

<p>Anyways, it&#8217;s interesting because I&#8217;m like that with other things as well. The truth really does set you free! (Even if it&#8217;s a small dose of it.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry about the downtime both today and last night.</p>

<p>Last night I was upgrading to <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn">Feisty</a> so it was taking a lot of the bandwidth away from my connection.  Thus it would be hard for people to have snuck in and successfully got back the pages that they were looking for without timing out.</p>

<p>And then sometime early this morning, my home DSL connection somehow died.  And I didn&#8217;t realize this until I was at work.  And that meant that nobody was physically around to restart everything.  Ah the downfalls of hosting your own site on a home connection.  It was pretty good for quite sometime.  I didn&#8217;t need to restart (and renew my IP address) for possibly a month or two?  That&#8217;s pretty good.  Well at least for me anyways.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to our regularly scheduled program!</p>
