  <div class="entry-content"><p>Alright so we had a fire drill the other day.  And it was annoying.  The sirens were piercingly loud.  I guess that&#8217;s good because you don&#8217;t want to have your earphones in and listening to music so that you don&#8217;t hear the alarm when it goes off.  Nevertheless the fact of the matter was that there wasn&#8217;t a fire and it did hurt my ears.</p>

<p>When you go down the stairs for the fire drill, it&#8217;s mild because nobody is actually trying to get away from a fire.  I can only imagine that some people would panic in the case of a real fire and try to run by people.  These are probably the same people that need to learn what I have to say <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/27/on-driving/">On Driving</a>.  They&#8217;re the ones zooming by, cutting you off, and still getting to the destination not a minute or two faster than you.  In a fire drill they&#8217;re gonna run as fast as they can, knock people over, and cause general pandemonium.  Great.</p>

<p>But those thoughts weren&#8217;t the most disturbing of the day.</p>

<p>Many people exited the building (it&#8217;s a 5 story one with multiple companies), and as we&#8217;re standing in the grass I see someone (from my company) who is standing there with his arms raised.  They&#8217;re resting on his head.  Maybe he was stretching.  Maybe he was subtly trying to get someone&#8217;s attention.  Maybe he was trying to touch the sky.  How do I know?  But whatever he was doing, all I know is that his shirt was too short (so it raised along with his arms), and his pants were sagging too much.  And there was a great view of his man hair (if you know what I mean, pubic hair if you don&#8217;t) if you&#8217;re into that.  But I&#8217;m not into that.  Not at all.  And I don&#8217;t know too many people who are.  So that made me unhappy and disgusted.</p>

<p>So remember, kids, to pull up your pants.  Especially if you&#8217;re at work.  Especially if you&#8217;re raising your arms up and trying to grab birds out of the air.  You know who you are.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a little slow on this news, but one of the sites that I subscribe and read (<a href="http://www.problogger.net">ProBlogger.net</a>) is having a contest to celebrate the anniversary of his blog.  You can find more details of it all at <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/10/02/54000-worth-of-prizes-on-offer-in-the-problogger-birthday-bash-competitions/">the competition page</a>.  There are $54,000 worth of prizes to be had in a number of smaller contests (although admittedly some of the contests are already done).  Many of them are fairly easy to participate in.</p>

<p>So check it out because remember: the possibility of winning is better than no possibility at all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, sorry to create a new post on the same subject (<a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/28/winning-with-blingo/">Winning With Blingo</a>).  But I just wanted to let people know about some further information about using Blingo.  Besides, it&#8217;s not as if this is going to be a series or anything like that.</p>

<p>Well it&#8217;s worth revisiting because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I got no comments on the last post.  Not that I&#8217;m extremely popular but posts seem to get a fair amount of comments usually.  Thus, I have no knowledge that anyone read it!</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s a worthwhile thing to do because I feel like people only stand to benefit from utilizing it.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;ll admit it, I want you to join through me because I wouldn&#8217;t mind getting extra chances to win things.  Who wouldn&#8217;t want that?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>In any case, for those of you using <a href="http://www.firefox.com">Firefox</a> I have a tip for you.  Now you can search Blingo in Firefox without ever having known the difference!</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to &#8220;about:config&#8221;.  This stores all of the configurations (sometimes hidden, sometimes available through menus) of everything in Firefox.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the keyword.enabled preference</p></li>
</ol>


<pre><code>1. In the "Filter:" text box, search for "keyword.enabled"


2. Right-click the entry with the Preference Name of "keyword.enabled" and click Toggle (make sure that the value is "enabled"
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Change the keyword.URL preference</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>1. In the "Filter:" text box, search for "keyword.URL"


2. Double-click the entry with the Preference Name of "keyword.URL".  Change the value to "http://www.blingo.com/search?q="
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Now hit Ctrl-L (hold Control and type the letter l) or Apple-L (Mac OS X) to access the URL bar.  Type something not a website that you want to search for.  Try &#8220;Derek Wong&#8221; if you&#8217;re unimaginative.  :)</p></li>
<li><p>You should be directed to the Blingo search results for &#8220;Derek Wong&#8221;!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>This is something that many people could benefit from.  Using the keyboard to access the url bar instead of the mouse is faster as well as minimizing ergonomic issues by using the mouse.  (If you didn&#8217;t know, increased and poor mouse usage contributes to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">Repetitive Strain/Stress Injuries</a>.)</p>

<p>Also this will allow you to search the Internet through Blingo (whose benefits I&#8217;ve expounded upon in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/28/winning-with-blingo/">Winning With Blingo</a>) without having to actually go to the Blingo site each time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you don&#8217;t know, <a href="http://www.blingo.com/">Blingo</a> is a website search engine.  You ask, &#8220;But there are tons of them out there, least of which Google, Yahoo!, etc.&#8221;  Well this search engine is different because they give out prizes just for searching!  A hoax you say?  Well follow me as I take you on a picture tour of actually winning something!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1140/1454878422_156b25aee7.jpg" alt="blingo_won_page" /><em>This is the page that I came upon while doing a normal search.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1018/1454010355_c9106a06b6.jpg" alt="blingo_prize" /><em>Here you see the page of instructions that I got in an e-mail from Blingo after submitting my information.</em></p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1170/1454878338_d13077b81a.jpg" alt="amazon_applied" /><em>I conveniently had an open, not-yet-shipped Amazon order that I could apply this gift certificate to.  It works!</em></p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1355/1454793136_cd3857b7fd.jpg" alt="cropped_blingo" /><em>And here I am, famous on www.blingo.com and everything.</em></p>

<p>So want to know more about it than just what it looks like to win?  Well I&#8217;m here to explain it to you (as I understand it from reading Blingo&#8217;s website anyways).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Blingo takes your search query and performs and equivalent search on Google</p></li>
<li><p>Blingo receives results from Google and displays them to you</p></li>
<li><p>Blingo also displays sponsored results like Google does</p></li>
<li><p>Blingo makes money on said sponsored results</p></li>
<li><p>Blingo buys some prizes with some of the money</p></li>
<li><p>At specified times, whoever performs a search closest to the time they will be presented with the page that I was presented with.  You have won!</p></li>
<li><p>Blingo doesn&#8217;t use all of the money on prizes, I&#8217;m sure.  So they will make money, and you <em>might</em> win something</p></li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s basically how Blingo works.  So let me just tell you that I think that it&#8217;s very reasonable to participate with them.  The way to approach it, though, is to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Think that you would have searched Google anyways for whatever it is that you wanted.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t expect to win because the odds of actually winning are minimal.</p></li>
<li><p>However, if you do win, then super!</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t perform extra searches for extra entries because you&#8217;d likely be wasting unnecessary time.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So you can see why I would think that it&#8217;s worthwhile to try!  And now that I won, it has solidified my use of it.  They also have a neat affiliate program where you can sign up your friends.  If someone that signed up through you wins, then you get the same exact prize.  The winner&#8217;s prize is <strong>not</strong> diminished, but the original winner and whoever referred them will get <strong>exactly the same prize</strong>.  If you&#8217;d like to sign up, then just click the button below.  (I thought it looked like a man with a rifle.  And I thought that was hilarious.  Let&#8217;s name him Bob.)  What that means is that if you win, I&#8217;ll just get a copy of what you win.  So we&#8217;ll both win.  Let&#8217;s win together!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In Runner&#8217;s World Magazine, I recently read <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-267--11909-0,00.html">an article about tempo running</a> that made me want to get back into the groove of running.  Tempo running (also known as lactate-threshold or threshold running)</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1149/1454476664_4846b1c5de_o.jpg" alt="kidrunners" /><em>Photo courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/people/w2/">W2 a-w-f-i-l</a></em></p>

<p>Until college, I always despised any running that I did.  Whether for P.E. or for sports, it was always a chore that was done with little enjoyment.  A necessary evil that we a prerequisite for the fun of something else.</p>

<p>And then in college something changed.  My fitness level was probably about the same so that wasn&#8217;t it.  My location and life were obviously different.  Whatever the reason was, though, I started to realize that running allowed me to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stay fit</p></li>
<li><p>Get some fresh air</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the area on foot rather than in a car</p></li>
<li><p>Spend some time alone in my thoughts</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I would run the loop around campus on a fairly regular basis.  I even started to enter into a few races.  What a turnaround from only a year or two before!  In any case by the time that I left college I was fairly comfortable going out for runs for recreation and fitness purposes.  In fact, I was even going out with other people occasionally for a little bit of socializing (in addition to the fitness benefit)!</p>

<p>So enough about the history of me and running.  I started to recently run a little bit (only once or twice a week, mind you).  However, after reading the article I was for some strange reason under an incorrect impression about tempo runs.  I thought that they were run faster than they really are.  I mean, &#8220;an 8 on a 1-to-10 scale&#8221; sounds pretty fast to me!  But reading the rest of the article as well as <a href="http://runningtimes.com/rt/articles/?id=5615&amp;page=2&amp;c=85">another article on tempo runs</a> made me realize that it&#8217;s simply more of a steady consistent pace, albeit a pace faster than one might normally jog.</p>

<p>What I have been doing is running at a consistent pace but for only much shorter intervals.  This week I ran 4 sets of 3:30 runs at probably about an 8 minutes/mile pace with a 60 second jog between sets.  Let me tell you that it&#8217;s not easy!  But I rather enjoy the challenge and am once again starting to enjoy the time alone, outside, and not in front of a computer (now that I&#8217;m in front of one the entire day for work).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure whether I&#8217;m going to continue this regime of running at a fairly brisk pace (but definitely NOT sprinting) for longer periods of time or whether I&#8217;m actually going to try a tempo run for 20 minutes.  Whatever the case, I will continue the running as it is affording me benefits that I value.</p>

<p>Running is even more than just exercise, though.  Have you thought of that?  You can learn a lot about life from running.  You can learn about yourself: are you persevering, are you stronger in mind than in body, are you even in shape?  You can teach yourself to be independent and strong in mind.  Running a race has been used as an analogy to life, and that&#8217;s because it is so true.  How better to understand the analogy (and correspondingly life) than by running yourself?</p>

<p>So go.  Do it.  Just do it.  (Does anyone remember Nike&#8217;s once ubiquitous slogan?  Whatever happened to that?  They went from simple to complex marketing in my opinion.)</p>
