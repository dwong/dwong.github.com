  <div class="entry-content"><p>After following the MacBook Pro&#8217;s progress from before it even came out to the first edition with its problems aplenty to the future iterations that got better and better, here is the culmination.</p>

<p>I initially started to get interested in the MBP once I realized that Mac OS X was much more than I had thought. It had pieces of BSD (a Unix foundation) and that seemed to me to be worthwhile. I wanted to see what it was like, and the MBP just became more and more attractive as I looked at it more.</p>

<p>Hopefully my waiting will pay off and my MBP will be trouble-free. Now by this time these kinds of things will not be very exciting to most people. there have been countless people who have done such posts and have tread this ground. But that is all by design because I don&#8217;t want to be one of the first (and almost by definition get all of the problems). In any case, here are the pictures. They&#8217;re not too interesting, but rest assured that I have some future related posts that may be more so.</p>

It looks so normal!</p>

I&#8217;m glad that they make it as shock-resistant as possible.</p>

Goodies, goodies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nobody likes to get error messages.  But I must admit that I do like it when they&#8217;re fun.  Better than getting a stack trace (but usually not as helpful).  They might not make up for the fact that your computer just messed up, but they&#8217;ll let you know that the people behind the messages are real people as well.</p>

<p>This particular goodie was probably a result of outpacing the browser with the keyboard shortcuts.  Yes you better believe it, I am that fast.

<p>These are the kinds of people that live by the &#8220;if life gives you lemons, then make lemonade&#8221; mentality.  Good for them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some small things that you can do that might just save your more than you&#8217;d think.  They&#8217;re easy to do, so give &#8216;em a shot!  It&#8217;s not a huge list of tips, but these are simply ones that I&#8217;ve thought of/started using recently.</p>

<ol>
<li>Navy Shower
Directions:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>1. Turn on water


2. Rinse


3. Turn off water


4. Lather and scrub


5. Turn on water


6. Rinse off


7. Turn off water


8. Enjoy the moment of the day that you will be the cleanest
</code></pre>

<p>Save yourself water like the sailors had to do on ships.  You&#8217;ll realize it&#8217;s not bad at all.  I mean do you really need to have water being wasted while you scrub?  I doubt it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Coasting in the car - When you&#8217;re driving around, think about the fact that only having two action options, accelerate and brake, could not be the most efficient.  There is room for some other option: do nothing and let the laws of physics propel you.  The momentum that you&#8217;ve previously gained can be utilized.  All you need to do is be more aware of things going on around you.  If there is a red light up ahead, take your foot off of both pedals and just let your car glide along.  Positives while doing this are</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>1. Less stress - Coasting, as in life, will let you relax


2. Save money - Not pressing the gas pedal will obviously not use gas and that is an obvious monetary savings


3. Have fun (and stay awake) - It's like a game to accurately figure out when to let off the gas in order to coast such that you won't have to brake at all.  Great for when you're falling asleep, huh?


4. Eliminate congestion - I should write about this sometime, but coasting at a constant speed in congestion will not only get you to your destination in the same time, but it will actually start the elimination of said congestion!  For those not totally self-centered, this can be seen as a huge positive.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Always turn off the light when you leave a room.  No matter how long you&#8217;re gone, it has been verified (okay okay, by the great <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html">Mythbusters</a>) that it&#8217;s more worthwhile to just turn off the light if you leave the room for ~20 seconds (I don&#8217;t remember the actual number).</li>
</ol>


<p>Pretty simple and straightforward, huh?  Let me know what you think about &#8216;em in the comments.  Or even better, give me some other tips.</p>

<p>Edit: I totally forgot that when I was thinking of this post I actually meant to also say that these things will save you money but will also help save the environment!  Take that into account, why don&#8217;t you?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Firefighters use some pretty powerful hoses.  I know this.  You know this.  But this video that I just saw confirms it.  Firehoses come in different sizes, and I would assume that they&#8217;re using numerous &#8220;Blitz line&#8221; (2 1/2 inch) or maybe even 3 inch hoses in order to do this.  10 of &#8216;em work the magic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you heard of DNS? Well if you haven&#8217;t, in short it is what allows you to memorize &#8220;google.com&#8221; rather than &#8220;72.14.207.99&#8221;. Every time you enter a website address into a browser, the browser first has to retrieve the actual numerical address (called an IP address) that corresponds to it so that it can actually access the website.</p>

<p>A real-world analogy would be looking up a phone number in a telephone book. You likely don&#8217;t memorize everyone&#8217;s number. In fact, you probably don&#8217;t know all too many by heart. But you can easily remember someone&#8217;s name, right?</p>

<p>So each time you enter the address, your web browser has to ask a DNS server to give you the IP address. Very often, your ISP will have a DNS cache to more quickly give you the IP address.</p>

<p>Something everyone should consider using is <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a>. It is a couple of DNS servers that are able to specify on your own computer to always use instead of whatever it is that you would otherwise use. Why is it good? Well OpenDNS offers things like safety from malicious websites (e.g. a misspelled website that causes you to arrive at a malicious website) and speed (likely from optimized servers) to name a few. Try it out, and see if you can notice a difference. I have and I do!</p>

<p>There are instructions at the OpenDNS website for every operating system, and they take but a few minutes.
  <em>[IP]: Internet Protocol
  </em>[ISP]: Internet Service Provider
  *[DNS]: Domain Name System</p>
