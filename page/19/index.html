  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>He lives vicariously&#8230;through himself.
-The Most Interesting Man In The World (Dos Equis Commercial)</p></blockquote>

<p>Parents do it through kids, friends do it through friends.  It happens when you watch television shows, sports games, and internet videos.  You envy someone else&#8217;s life.  They have it better than you.  Or maybe they just have the <em>opportunity</em> to have it better than you.</p>

<p>Instead of discovering all that you can do with what you have, you choose to focus your attention on someone else.  Their success is your success.  Except it really isn&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s still their success.  At best, the focus of your attention will give you credit and thanks.  At worst, you get nothing.</p>

<p>Why live a life that is so unfulfilled?  (I feel rather like I am a motivational speaker right now.)  But there is so much to be content with!  I can enjoy <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Biggest_Loser/">The Biggest Loser</a> because it is (at its root) about people learning that they can achieve what they could only dream about before.</p>

<p>It is fantastic to be glad that someone has gone and done something great.  But I can&#8217;t help but always wonder at people when they don&#8217;t realize that they could get places that they never dreamed of as well.  So while we were not created simply for earthly pleasures, life was definitely not meant to be watched either.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finishing a <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/513/marathon/">marathon</a> is pretty good right?  Well what about finishing it and getting to help a worthy cause?  That is even better!  I was talking with a friend today, and she suggested that it would be a good idea to raise money for a charity since I have been doing all of this training already.  After I thought about it, I realized that it made a lot of sense.  People seem to be willing to help out since they can see that it is something that I would care about.</p>

<p>I looked at a number of very worthy charities before I decided that I wanted to be a part of <a href="http://www.worldvision.org/content.nsf/getinvolved/teamwv">Team World Vision</a>.</p>

<p>From their website:</p>

<blockquote><p>World Vision is a Christian humanitarian charity organization dedicated to working with children, families, and their communities worldwide to reach their full potential by tackling the causes of poverty and injustice.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are interested in joining with me to donate to a worthy cause, please visit my fundraising page:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh boy that was sweet.  Okay let me qualify that by saying that I enjoy when things are easy and efficient.  If you feel differently, then you may very well disagree with me.</p>

<p>So on a nice lazy morning I decided to look into converting my permalink structure to one that I preferred.  Permalinks are how Wordpress describes permanent links to a post.  When I first started this blog a couple of years ago (seriously, that long??) I decided on going with a fairly standard /yyyy/mm/dd/post-name type of structure for my posts.  However, I am now a little opposed to this since it reveals more information than I would like.  I tend to think that my writing transcends time since I am not usually writing about current events so I want to remove a visitor&#8217;s perception that my post is not worth reading just because it is old.</p>

<p>After searching online, I came upon Scott Yang&#8217;s <a href="http://scott.yang.id.au/code/permalink-redirect/">Permalink Redirect plugin</a>.  The instructions seemed easy enough so I:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Downloaded it</p></li>
<li><p>Unzipped, installed, and activated it</p></li>
<li><p>Accessed the new Settings->Permalink Redirect page.  Under &#8220;Old Permalink Structure&#8221; clicked the link after &#8220;Current permalink structure&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Accessed Settings->Permalinks.  Changed to a /post-id/post-name structure.  (I used tags that I found <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Structure_Tags">here</a>.)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>All of my old links are now redirecting correctly!  And that, my friends and enemies, is sweet!  Especially since it took less time than it has taken me to write this post.  I&#8217;m loving <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> all over again for its abilities, both built-in and extensible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, I am still training for my <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2009/02/03/marathon/">marathon</a>.  Some lessons that I have been learning:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You are very likely under the impression that cotton is a glorious and soft fabric.  But let me tell you that 15 miles can dictate otherwise.  <strong>Chaffing is real, people.  And it&#8217;s dangerous.</strong>  It is just crazy how such a small discomfort can completely occupy your mind.  It is a nice reminder to get yourself set up completely before setting out.  So beware for certain parts of your body.  Personally it happens with my crotch and nipples.  Is that too much information?  Haha TOO BAD! :D</p></li>
<li><p>Seriously?  <strong>Cracks in the sidewalk</strong>?  In fact yes.  I thought it ludicrous to even consider them.  How hard is it to just watch where you&#8217;re running?  If there&#8217;s a crack, don&#8217;t trip on it.  It&#8217;s obvious, it&#8217;s simple.  And I failed.  Yes, that is correct.  I was running a while ago, and I was paying attention to the jacket that I was holding in my hand.  Next thing I knew, I was stumbling and nearly on my face.  Thanks to the amazing reflexes that God placed in me, I was able to remain upright.  Really, I couldn&#8217;t believe that I didn&#8217;t eat some cement right there.  A passing truck saw and slowed down, but continued on their way once they saw that I had not even fallen down.  I counted my lucky stars and was thankful (once again) for reflexes that are faster than I can say, &#8220;Oh no!&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Running along major streets leads to some interesting scenarios.  People driving by can be placed into a few categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Haters</strong> - They will try their very hardest to scare me with honks and shouts.  Usually they&#8217;re in high school, and they have so little in their life to be excited about that the best thing to happen to them would be to see others suffer.  Pretty much they&#8217;re retarded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Encouragers</strong> - When passing they either honk in a more friendly way or yell out encouragement.  I appreciate that, and I think that&#8217;s right kind of them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leerers</strong> - This probably happens much more to girls, but there are definitely those that will make comments that are somewhat lascivious.  As a guy, I actually think that it&#8217;s awesome to get that.  Haha don&#8217;t judge me.  A girl yelled, &#8220;Sexy!&#8221; when I was running without a shirt a little while back.  Why didn&#8217;t I have a shirt on?  Because I can!  Well that&#8217;s only partly true.  It was also pretty hot and&#8230; see the point about chaffing.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When something is too good everyone thinks that something is wrong.  A little while back I made a T-shirt, and it surprisingly turned out decently.  Considering that I am not very artistic, it was rather miraculous that the lines were straight and the overall presentation was just fine.  However, the most interesting thing that I found was that people that saw it did not realize that I did it freehand.  Since the lines were straight and everything looked good, there were some that just thought that I used a stencil while other people did not even realize that I had made the shirt!</p>

<p>It is easy and natural for people to only believe something if they can see the flaw in it.  Else they will think that something is amiss (e.g., a machine made the product and you are trying to pass it off as your own work).  Most of the time this is spot-on.  People are imperfect.  Everyone knows this.  Why else would we need Jesus?  Still it&#8217;s rather amusing to note that while people can assume that perfection in other people is acceptable, perfection is a piece of handiwork is odd.</p>
