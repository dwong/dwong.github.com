  <div class="entry-content"><p>Files on computers are made up of different characters that are interpreted by whatever it is that you are using.  That means that no matter what file it is, it is essentially a string of bytes that are interpreted by the program opening it.  This means that your music program tries to interpret whatever file you open with it to be conformed to some audio standards (mp3, wma, etc.).  Try to open the same file in a text editor, and you&#8217;ll find yourself looking at (apparently) junk characters.  But then you&#8217;ll realize that the file is still just a bunch of characters.</p>

<p>I bring this up because</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It seems as if people don&#8217;t realize this.</p></li>
<li><p>I encountered this while writing a Perl script today.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Something else that you should read even if you don&#8217;t know what Perl is: Windows and Unix-variants (including Mac OS X and up) do not handle files the same.  I&#8217;m not talking about <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/28/fanaticism/">Fanaticism</a> (because I&#8217;ve already posted about that).  Windows uses characters that are referred to as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return">Carriage Return</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_feed">Line Feed</a> in order to represent a newline.  These names originate because of their original use in the typewriter which actually had a physical mechanism to move.  In any case, Unix-variants utilize the line feed character to distinguish its newlines.  This can obviously lead to some problems if you use the same files on both systems.</p>

<p><strong>If you don&#8217;t know what Perl is then you can fairly safely stop reading this article now because the rest won&#8217;t help you much.</strong>  I know that it was hard for me to find and I&#8217;d like to make it available if anyone else so happens to run into the same problem.</p>

<p>While writing a script in Perl today, I had a seemingly strange problem where I would do some processing on my Windows machine and then transfer the file via FTP to a Unix-based server.  However I noticed that I had a string that when printed to the screen on my Windows computer would display correctly but would display incorrectly in the file put onto the server.  I could not figure this out for quite sometime because it seemed as if some of the lines were printing correctly and some were not.  Alright enough explanation.  Essentially I thought that the last character was getting chopped off in some way that I did not understand in Perl.  However it had to do with Perl assuming that the lines has both a carriage return and a line feed on the lines and then chopping them off when the file was being sent via FTP.  The fix that I ended up using was simply a one line regular expression like so (a suggestion from a co-worker):</p>

<p><code>$output=</code>some action<code>;
$output=~ s/n/rn/g;
print $output;
print FOUT $output;</code></p>

<p>Hope that this helps someone searching for an answer.  I know that I would have liked to have happened upon the answer while searching for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a cost to running your own web server.  I&#8217;m not talking about the actual monetary cost, although there definitely is some of that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m talking about the down time and lack of production-level reliability.  I just got my Internet connection back up after being down nearly the entire day!  I had checked the status in the morning, and it was working.  However, when I got to work I couldn&#8217;t access it.  &#8220;Oh great,&#8221; I thought.</p>

<p>So basically I just lost a day of traffic, readership, etc.  Great, that just stinks.  You know I wonder what my uptime percentage is.  I was thinking about it today as a result of not having it available, and I am positive that I am up more than 9 days out of 10.  However, I&#8217;m pretty sure that I couldn&#8217;t claim more than 95%.  Oh well.</p>

<p>Anyways, I think that the benefits to running my own web server outweigh the cost.  Let me share what I think some of them are.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Learn more about how the Internet works by becoming more than a user, become a cog.</p></li>
<li><p>Know <em>exactly</em> where all of your data is stored</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t have to pay for hosting costs (okay, okay there is the electricity to run the computer which is definitely something.  But you&#8217;re not getting charged 15 bucks a month like you normally would be.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn interesting server-related things such as configuring Apache.  This is especially interesting for those who have a professional interest in computers I think.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Is it worth it to you?  I don&#8217;t even know what the percentages are of people who run their own server.  I actually don&#8217;t know too many people that do.  Of course I guess that speaks more about the people that I know than what is actually going on.  In any case, sorry for the downtime, and I&#8217;m back (for now).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an article at Yahoo! about <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/43610153">cracking down on college music pirates</a>, I read about one Sarah Barg, a sophomore from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  It portrayed her as a girl who was just taking part in what everyone else was doing.  The article wanted to put her in the role of one who is definitely not the worst (I mean she <em>only</em> downloaded 381 songs when others were downloading thousands!).  In response to it all, Barg says</p>

<blockquote><p>Obviously I knew it was illegal, but no one got in trouble for it</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, I know that all higher education is not equal.  And I know that maybe not all of them are as good as the <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>, but that does not allow for such ridiculous thoughts.  I think that ignorance is not a good excuse for doing wrong.  The onus is on you to do what&#8217;s right.  However, I think that actually knowing that something is wrong and yet still doing it speaks of some darker black.</p>

<p>In any case, I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s a matter of intelligence.  I think it&#8217;s a sign of the times.</p>

<p>Piracy does not just affect music as I wrote in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/14/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/">Even Worse Than At First Glance</a>, <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/04/cheatin-chinese/">Cheain&#8217; Chinese</a>, and (in regards to cheating in general) <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/">Cheaters 4 Life</a>.  Wow I did not realize that I had so many entries devoted to ranting about cheaters!  But I digress.</p>

<p>Reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t be a (music) pirate:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can afford the music (or whatever it is that you&#8217;re pirating).</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>* If you can't afford it, you don't need it.


* If you really can't afford it, you have things that you should be doing other than listening to music anyways.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>You can support and encourage the artists that you like to keep making music.  It&#8217;s kind of like writing a blog and getting encouraged by people leaving comments.  Except for them it&#8217;s people giving them money.  I&#8217;m applying my energy to the wrong thing.  :P</p></li>
<li><p>You know it&#8217;s morally wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s actually against the law.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now I admit that I&#8217;m not perfect, but I would like to think that once I knew the truth then I would change my behavior to match what I know.  Not everyone is like this.  But they should be.  It just makes sense to have your behavior in line with your opinions, does it not?  Don&#8217;t be the person who gets laughed at for coming off as stupid.  Nobody wants 15 minutes of infamy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[ri-<strong>nig</strong>, -<strong>neg</strong>, -<strong>neeg</strong>]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>To break a rule, go back on one&#8217;s word, cheat (especially at cards)</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>When you play hearts, you need to follow suit if you have the suit that is first played.  If someone plays a spade and you have a spade but you play a diamond instead, you just reneged.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>I learned this word in 11th grade honors English because we learned how to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ombre">Ombre</a> after reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_of_the_lock">Rape Of The Lock</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pope">Alexander Pope</a>.  Pretty random huh?  Anyways, it&#8217;s a slightly archaic word, but I have still found that it can be used on occasion.  For all the card players, it will be an especially useful word to use because it is often used in that context.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;m not sure how many of you are aware of how often people actually make money off of blogging.  Many of my readers probably are not very acquainted with the idea.  They&#8217;re accustomed to doing things for free and because they like it.  That&#8217;s fine and well, but there is in fact a market for actually making money simply by blogging.  Amazing isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Well now you might be wondering whether blogging is even worth it as a venture to make money.  Let me point your attention to a site that teaches you how you can <a href="http://www.johnchow.com/">make money online</a>.  Even though right now I&#8217;m participating in <a href="http://www.johnchow.com/make-money-online-review-my-blog/">a contest</a> to review his site to get a backlink from his site, this really is a site that I have been subscribing to in my RSS reader.</p>

<p>To start off with, John Chow is a Canadian resident (whom none of you probably actually know personally) who started trying to turn his blog into a money-maker less than a year ago.  He writes articles about how he is making money as well as ideas and tips for other people who would want to do the same.  He uses his own site as a case study in how money can be made.  In every month since he started his blog, he has enjoyed increased revenue.  He is a proponent of a lot of different advertisements and partner deals (including the ubiquitous AdSense which I am using).  With the combined revenue from all of his sources, he made a bit under $12,000 in the month of April.  It&#8217;s pretty amazing to see what someone can do with just a blog!  Of course the caveat to this for all of you is that his blog is less of a personal one and more of a targeted one.  Nevertheless it&#8217;s impressive.</p>

<p>Although I generally read all of the articles, I think that the main downside that I see to what he is writing about is that he sometimes hits a ceiling in terms of content.  Often (simply by the mere subject matter) there will be repetition in his advice so I can see how this blog will be very interesting initially but could lose interest for readers after they have read it for awhile.</p>

<p>Anyways, I have enjoyed reading about different ideas and methods that he&#8217;s used, and I suggest that anyone interested in the topic should take a look at it.  This is especially useful for those that are hosting (or paying for hosting) of their own site as there is some cost to running the site.</p>
