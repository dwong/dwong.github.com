  <div class="entry-content"><p>So another advantage to hosting my own blog (okay it&#8217;s not <em>just</em> limited to hosting yourself) in addition to other <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/15/cost-and-benefits-of-running-your-own-server/">costs and benefits of running your own server</a> is that you get to see statistics.  You can install any type of tracking system.  I personally am using <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">Statcounter</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, but there are a plethora of options out there.</p>

<p>In any case I&#8217;d like to share what some amusing searches on my site have been:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>pastor &#8220;Derek Wong&#8221; </strong>- <em>Say whaaatt?  Haha</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>siafu ant</strong> - <em>One would think that I would get no hits on the Siafu Ants since there are other much more reputable sources than my blog on a species of ant.  Oh well.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>tweedle dee tweedle dumb </strong>- <em>Apparently nobody writes about Alice in Wonderland anymore.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>how to use gimp to make a passport photo</strong> - <em>I would guess that someone could arrive at my site on this because it&#8217;s a pretty specific topic that I wrote a post about.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jennifer Shih facebook </strong>- <em>Now that&#8217;s just strange.  Quit it stalker kids.  Or rather, quit it stalker boys.  :P</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>amazing gross photos </strong>- <em>I think that&#8217;s awesome that they could arrive at my site on these keywords!  Of course I probably disappoint because I don&#8217;t exactly have amazingly gross photos.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>wong way poet </strong>- <em>That seems pretty specific to me.  You&#8217;d think that they could just remember &#8220;goingthewongway&#8221; if they can already remember &#8220;wong way.&#8221;  Or maybe there is just some poet out there named wong who is writing about the way.  I bet he wants my domain name.  :P</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>california dmv temporary-operating-permit </strong>- <em>I&#8217;m very happy that I can provide the answer to this.  I know that I would have wanted to happen upon the answer in a quick search!</em></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Okay that is just a taste.  And considering that some of these searches are old, I make no guarantees that you will still find me indexed for these keywords.  I just wanted to share how amusing it is for me to see these things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well I suppose that there aren&#8217;t too many original ideas out there.  Nevertheless, when I happened upon a piece of software called <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/featured-download/allocate-your-money-in-envelopes-with-budget-262014.php">Budget</a>
while I was reading through my feed reader this morning, I had to take a second look.  Why?  Well because I wrote (and am in current development of) <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/the-budgeteer/">The Budgeteer</a>!</p>

<p>There were notable differences, obviously.  Comparing the two programs, here is what I noticed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Budget deposits absolute amounts into each sub-account (represented as envelopes) whereas the Budgeteer deposits percentages into each sub-account.  I recently thought about this difference actually.  It would be nice to have options to do both/either.  My original approach of percentages allows for things such as taking 10% off the top for tithe, but it has pitfalls such as having to specify a percentage for each sub-account.  Granted of course you can play around with them over time such that they will approach what you actually need/want/use.</p></li>
<li><p>Budget is much prettier.  Both their Windows and Mac executables look better than my Python GUI.  Granted, I haven&#8217;t been trying to make it beautiful or anything.  And it is essentially the same functionality (clicking on different buttons, etc).  Nevertheless, that is a plus that Budget has.</p></li>
<li><p>Obviously Budget is production software that is being sold whereas the Budgeteer is something that I wrote up in a week and have since played with only a little bit.  Budget also costs 30 bucks, and (when the time comes) the Budgeteer will not.</p></li>
<li><p>The Budgeteer has a cooler name.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>All in all, I would like to think that Budget and the Budgeteer are similar.  However, I must concede that they are not even close to similar.  Budget is much more polished, and I am now more determined to develop the Budgeteer!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve changed the name of the program to Budgeteer.  I don&#8217;t know why I need so many e&#8217;s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[<strong>kuhl</strong>-p_uh<em>-b_uh</em> l]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>Rightfully deserving of blame or penalty</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>Planning and scheming for those many weeks was harmless fun, but once the thieves stepped onto the property of the bank that fateful night, they were culpable for their crimes.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This is a fairly oft-encountered word I think.  It&#8217;s definitely not used all of the time (because of its definition).  However there aren&#8217;t too many words that could take its place.  And thus if you ever need a word with a definition like this word&#8217;s, you need to know this one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Read through old notes from those that might or might not have been interested in you.  Find out both how weak the writing skills of young people can be as well as how strange you must have been to have thought it personally normal to interact with people in this way.</p>

<p>Watch videos of yourself as a kid that show that you had the makings of who you are even back then.  Even if that means that you were one who found humor in bullying others.</p>

<p>Flip through some pictures that will make you laugh and some that will make you grimace.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s amusing to look back, wouldn&#8217;t you say?  Even though junk is not something that I&#8217;d prefer to keep around in general, you also have to know what to save.  A box full of memories is something that everyone would do well to keep.  Just think about how it can be used for instant fun when you can&#8217;t think of anything else.  Or like when you can&#8217;t think of anything to blog about.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Enter the majestic gates.
Or rather, the opening beneath the rolling warehouse door.
Let them greet you as you flash your pass.
Could you want anything more?</p>

<p>Try out the little goodies all around.
Different tastes offer themselves to you.
The sweet and the salty, the bread and meat.
All mixed in your stomach like some strange stew.</p>

<p>What will you do when the crowd confronts you?
You seem overwhelmed and help from who?
Nobody cares about you and your posse.
Oh look the pirate child to the rescue!</p>

<p>He has a sword on his little belt.
And a fearsome glow within his eyes.
His hand is at the ready,
But possibly if his Popsicle is taken he cries.</p>

<p>The cheese! The cheese!
Oh so much cheese!
You want to eat more?
Well then just say please.</p>

<p>Bring your riches, then you may pass.
I see the light, oh yonder ho!
There is just one standing in our way.
She then says, &#8220;thank you for coming to Casgo.&#8221;</p>
