  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you&#8217;re out and about, you might happen upon people that are moving to sound.  Yes yes, in life you might see dancing.  Whether in the club or at an organized school dance or at a wedding or in your house, dancing has a way of getting to people.  Some more than others.</p>

<p>Is it just me or does it always seem like people like to develop into circles when they&#8217;re dancing in groups?  And where there is a circle, there will eventually be someone in the mush pot.  It also seems like there is a particular type of person that always ends up in the middle.  Maybe they like the attention.  Maybe they&#8217;re trying to impress a special someone.  Or maybe they just love a little space while they&#8217;re busting their moves.  Everyone who&#8217;s not in the circle?  I think that they like the circles because they can be entertained without having to actually dance.</p>

<p>Me?  I say no to circles!  Fun for all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aren&#8217;t bathrooms full of such interesting happenings?</p>

<p>In the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290002/">Meet the Fockers</a> as Bernie Focker is giving everyone a tour of their house, he eventually gets to the bathroom.  When he&#8217;s there, he tells them the rule of the house is</p>

<blockquote><p>If it&#8217;s yellow let it mellow, if it&#8217;s brown flush it down.
-Bernie Focker</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that I&#8217;m working with someone who has taken that to heart.</p>

<p>No, scratch that.  Some of them don&#8217;t even flush it down.  Decency people, decency!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nobody is born with the ability to do everything.  Somehow we have to learn things.  Even when we are talented at something, we still need to actually learn it before our talent can manifest itself.</p>

<p>When I was learning how to drive a manual transmission, I got to go out with other people as I learned the basics of how it worked.  But trying things out every couple of weeks could only get me so far.  It was only when I got my own vehicle and had the chance to go out by myself that I started to work things out.  Sure I failed.  Sometimes miserably so.  I can still remember some of those violent stalls where it felt as if the automobile body was going to separate from the wheels.  But eventually it came together.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve learned that while it&#8217;s easy to dictate (or be dictated to), it&#8217;s much better to give people the opportunity to shine.  In other words, teaching a man to fish means sometimes the man doesn&#8217;t catch a thing.  But he will.</p>

<p>Or&#8230;he&#8217;ll starve.  In which case, I don&#8217;t know because the illustration doesn&#8217;t really cover that scenario.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve all seen people that have more hair than others.  There are some that also have hair where others might not have it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these follicles are not really something that we get to choose.  Whether we like it or not, we have genes that entirely dictate such things as the color of our hair, our height, and where hair grows on our body.  We can try to change these things through dye, clothing, and hair removal (or implantation).  But in reality we are who we are made to be.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s sad that we judge people based on things that they cannot change.  (This is in no way a political statement about homosexuality, even though it&#8217;s becoming apparent to me that it can be interpreted as such.  Or maybe it&#8217;s just been on the mind with Proposition 8 in California.  Anyways, see <a href="http://www.narth.com/docs/istheregene.html">this</a> for some truth about the &#8220;gay gene&#8221; research done by Dr. Dean Hamer.  But I digress.)</p>

<p>So people can&#8217;t control things like where their hair grows.  How do we in society get so disgusted by it?  I admit that I can/do as well.  But it&#8217;s strange how we can make demeaning statements about  things that are not determined by these people at all!</p>

<p>Sometimes society stinks.  And for sure mobs of people are no good.</p>
