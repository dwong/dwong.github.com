  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you checked out <a href="http://www.google.com/history/">Google Web History</a> lately?  It&#8217;s pretty scary stuff.  It&#8217;s a log of what you have searched for on Google.  I know that Google&#8217;s slogan is &#8220;don&#8217;t be evil,&#8221; but it is not comforting to be able to look at your past searches for weeks.</p>

<p>Personally I went in, cleared it and then put it on &#8220;pause.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t really want anyone to be tracking what I&#8217;m searching for and building a profile on me.  It just seems so invasive.  And I don&#8217;t like it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the extras for the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371246/">Spanglish</a>, there is a deleted scene in which the mother prays with the daughter before they come to the U.S and says</p>

<blockquote><p>Please God, only let the bad things change me</p></blockquote>

<p>Interesting thought, isn&#8217;t it?  You probably have to think about that for a little to even understand it.  Well I did anyways.  I definitely thought it was interesting when I first saw it.</p>

<p>And then this morning I thought it was even more interesting as I was perusing the newspaper with <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/06/break-the-fast-twice/">my breakfast</a>.  I saw an article about Lindsey Lohan&#8217;s outrageous behavior.  Now granted, I do not know what Miss Lohan was like before she became famous, but I do know that it seems like more often than not, people are corrupted by success.  If you don&#8217;t know about this particular case, she was basically caught driving drunk as well as with a substance, possibly cocaine.</p>

<p>In any case whether it be a star athlete getting a big head or a rock star falling into drugs or anything else, it&#8217;s fairly safe to say that power and success can definitely corrupt.</p>

<p>I am not a big believer on following the lives of other people (especially &#8220;stars&#8221;).  Still, one can&#8217;t help but see that very often their world will get turned upside down and become less and less likable as their &#8220;star power&#8221; increases.  It&#8217;s a shame that it&#8217;s so.</p>

<p>I guess Spanglish has content that&#8217;s deeper than you&#8217;d think.  Maybe it&#8217;d be wise to heed the advice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you seen <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/manvswild/manvswild.html">Man vs Wild</a> on the Discovery Channel?</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s a show that follows one man as he tries to overcome the challenge of surviving in the wilderness with little more than what a traveler might have.</p>

<p>I love this show.  It&#8217;s amazing while also being hilarious.  First off, the man&#8217;s name is Bear.  That&#8217;s not a nickname.  That&#8217;s just his name.  You <strong>know</strong> that he&#8217;s gotta be awesome if his name is &#8220;Bear.&#8221;  In any case, a cameraman (okay maybe a crew?) follows him as he does whatever it takes to survive in various harsh climates.  I&#8217;ve seen him in places like the Rockies, a volcano crater in Hawaii, the African desert, and other such fun places.</p>

<h3>7 Favorite Moments From Man vs Wild</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>When he <strong>eats a live snake</strong> by biting off the head (which according to Bear would taste disgusting) and slurping the rest of it through his mouth like a spaghetti noodle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Eating maggots</strong> from an animal that was killed in an avalanche.  Apparently the actual animal flesh would be dangerous to eat because it&#8217;s rotten.  But the maggots that eat the rotten flesh?  They&#8217;re just fine.  Who would&#8217;ve thought?</p></li>
<li><p>When he tries to <strong>ride a wild horse</strong> but fails miserably because he tries to mount it after only being around it for a little bit.  I think that because he&#8217;s so good, it&#8217;s pretty funny when he fails.  :P</p></li>
<li><p>Catching and <strong>taking a big bite out of a live fish</strong>.  He looked like Gollum.  It was disgustingly awesome.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding a zebra that was killed by lions and then picked by vultures.  The bones are clean.  So what does Bear do?  He cuts off the skin near the neck and <strong>eats the zebra meat raw</strong>.  And then he puts some in his pocket to eat later!</p></li>
<li><p>Talking about how rattlesnakes are dangerous and how you shouldn&#8217;t get close to them.  All the while <strong>walking closer and closer to the rattlesnake</strong> right in front of him.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding a mound of ants, talking about how he only eats the abdomen of the ants because the bite hurts, and then <strong>allowing an ant to bite his tongue</strong> so that you can see how much it must hurt.  And the ants are actually a &#8220;sweet treat&#8221; to him.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Isn&#8217;t it amazing what people will do to survive?  I don&#8217;t think that this kind of brutal living is ever hardly seen by many of us because we are in &#8220;civilized&#8221; locations.</p>

<p>I think that a great part of the appeal to the show is that he (seemingly) actually enjoys all of it.  Oh and for some reason the British accent makes it that much more interesting and authentic.</p>

<p>I could learn a lot from this show.  Perhaps even more than just the survival techniques.  But even if I couldn&#8217;t, at least I&#8217;d have a great time being grossed out, amazed, and entertained.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t like when people use English words or phrases without knowing how to use them.  I started compiling a list after reading some blogs and noticing errors in their English.  And these were not blogs started in foreign countries.  These were supposedly English language based blogs!  In any case, peruse the list and see if you&#8217;re guilty of any of these mistakes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>maybe/may be</strong> - <em>&#8220;Maybe&#8221; means perhaps while &#8220;may be&#8221; means could be.  Okay okay I know that using &#8220;be&#8221; in the definition is not good.  Nevertheless, there is a definite difference between the phrases.  Examples: &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll go tonight&#8221; vs &#8220;She may be going tonight&#8221;</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>they&#8217;re/their/there</strong> - <em>This difference between words is pretty well-known, and yet it is still often misused.  The first is a contraction of &#8220;they are&#8221; so you have to be able to substitute &#8220;they are everywhere you use &#8220;they&#8217;re.&#8221;  &#8220;Their&#8221; is possessive.  &#8220;There&#8221; indicates location.  Examples: &#8220;They&#8217;re going to eat food&#8221; vs &#8220;I&#8217;m going to eat their food&#8221; vs &#8220;We are going to eat food there&#8221;</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>its/it&#8217;s</strong> - <em>This happens so often it&#8217;s sickening.  Haha I just used &#8220;it&#8217;s.&#8221;  Anyways &#8220;its&#8221; is a possessive of a previously mentioned inanimate object while &#8220;it&#8217;s&#8221; is a contraction of &#8220;it is.&#8221;  Examples: &#8220;Don&#8217;t judge a book by its cover&#8221; vs &#8220;Look around the city in the fall and see how it&#8217;s all changing&#8221;</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>site/sight</strong> - <em>The difference between these words is that &#8220;site&#8221; means location and &#8220;sight&#8221; means something that is seen.  Examples: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we go to the construction site to see how things are going&#8221; vs &#8220;Boy those fireworks over the water sure are a sight to see.&#8221;</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>buy/by/bye</strong> - <em>&#8220;Buy&#8221; means &#8220;to purchase&#8221;, &#8220;by&#8221; is a preposition that has a number of meanings including &#8220;of or near to&#8221; or &#8220;through a particular medium&#8221;, &#8220;bye&#8221; is either a shortening of the common greeting &#8220;goodbye&#8221; or the opportunity for a team to not have to play another team in a  sports tournament.</em></p></li>
</ol>


<p>In any case that list is not, by an means, exhaustive.  I think that I actually don&#8217;t mind it when people know that they are not experts at English.  However, I think that I have the most problem with people when they make it seem as if they have a complete idea of what they&#8217;re saying.  Such is life, huh?  So try to learn what you can.  Oh and stop by the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/learn-something/word-of-the-week/">Word of the Week</a> to learn some good vocabulary.</p>
