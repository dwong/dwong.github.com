  <div class="entry-content"><p>You might have heard of a wiki. Then again, you also might not have heard one it. It&rsquo;s a method of displaying user-modifiable content. That is, it can be changed by the people looking at it. This is different than things like this blog where I and I alone get to write. The wiki has been gaining notoriety since it allows the collaboration of knowledge, especially over the Internet.</p>

<p>The name wiki gets its name from Ward Cunningham, developer of the very first wiki. It&rsquo;s actually Hawaiian in origin (wiki means fast), but you can read more about that at Wikipedia&rsquo;s (appropriate since it&rsquo;s one of the most well known wikis) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">page on the wiki</a>.</p>

<h4>The TiddlyWiki</h4>

<p>So now that we&rsquo;ve got the foundation knowledge in place, I wanted to share about the <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a>. (It still strikes me as an amusing name.) It is touted as a personal non-linear personal web notebook. I like to think of it as a central place where you can store whatever you want. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to use after some initial adjustment. It is a single html file just like any old webpage.</p>

<p>To use it just open it up in any web browser, and you&rsquo;re ready to go. Double-click on things to change them, and you can start creating new tiddlers (entries) and deleting ones that you don&rsquo;t need. Saving your changes saves the information into that exact same html file. So all of the data <strong>and</strong> the framework are contained within a single file. As long as you have a web browser, you can modify your file. And what computer out there doesn&rsquo;t have some sort of a web browser nowadays?</p>

<p>This file is the perfect size for a portable usb drive. It starts off empty at about 250KB, but it doesn&rsquo;t grow all that quickly since only the new text that is added is stored.</p>

<p>The TiddlyWiki is a method that is open to different uses. And there are many.</p>

<h4>Some uses for TiddlyWiki</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Web Journal &ndash; save links and articles that you find online</p></li>
<li><p>Blog &ndash; extremely easy to write and publish (just put the html file on a web server and it&rsquo;s published)</p></li>
<li><p>Personal Journal &ndash; just have the file with you wherever you are, and it&rsquo;ll be safe from prying eyes</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborate on projects &ndash; one person can write and the changes will be instantly available for anyone else to see</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are many ways to store information. You could write it on paper, you could just remember everything, you could use a Microsoft Word document, whatever. So here are some reasons why you&rsquo;d use a TiddlyWiki instead of one of those other methods.</p>

<h4>Advantages of TiddlyWiki</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Basic tags (which allow you to quickly see all entries with a particular tag)</p></li>
<li><p>Quick searching as you type into the search box</p></li>
<li><p>Self-contained (it&rsquo;s a single file)</p></li>
<li><p>Portable (I guess that&rsquo;s always relative, but it&rsquo;s small in size)</p></li>
<li><p>Interactive feel</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Server-side Implementations</h4>

<p>Personally I&rsquo;ve been using a version of this that&rsquo;s on my server. I tried a couple of different products, but MiniTiddlyServer (Update: MiniTiddlyServer is not deprecated so you will need to figure out another way) was the easiest and most straightforward for my PHP-enabled server. All I needed to do was download the zip file, put it onto my server, and off I went! Update: Check out <a href="http://wiki.goingthewongway.com/">my own TiddlyWiki</a></p>

<p>For those without their own server, <a href="http://tiddlyspot.com">TiddlySpot</a> seems like a reasonable free solution.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So over a year after starting, I&rsquo;m at 200 posts.  It didn&rsquo;t take too long I guess.  Oh well at least it&rsquo;s not 50 days after starting!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2407/2398874603_33786fd172_o.jpg" alt="balloons" /><em>Courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/verdesam/">Verdesam</a></em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone from posting things that I really wanted to put out there to posting everyday about stupid stuff that I found online to posting once a week some things that I see in life.  And sometimes I even post things that will be useful to someone else.</p>

<p>But one thing is constant, this is <strong>my</strong> blog, and I get to do whatever I want with it!  And I love that!  :D</p>

<p>Still, the fact that I&rsquo;ve written that many entries is pretty amazing to me.  Let&rsquo;s not think about how much time was spent writing those things.  Rather, let&rsquo;s enjoy the fact that I have an outlet by which to release my thoughts.  Priceless, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A touch
And&hellip;ah relief
But where did the precious item go?
It&rsquo;s probably at my feet</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not there
I heard a tinkle, a sound of hard items contacting
But it&rsquo;s not there
Not where I&rsquo;d expect it</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on my knees
Begging, hoping, almost praying
When will I know?</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m searching far and wide
In the depths of despair
Amidst the trash and the disgusting
Nobody should need to look at this stuff, let alone touch it
But it&rsquo;s worth it</p>

<p>Who will accept it?
When will I be satisfied?
When will I know the secrets that I want to know?
Ah this is so much trouble
I want to rest
I give up</p>

<p>Oh.
There it is right under my nose!
Well, not quite <em>right</em> under
More like a little to the right&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We, as people, have a love/hate relationship with one of the things that is constantly changing: our age.  Sometimes we want to get older, and sometimes we will do everything that we can to reduce it.  But we really have no control over it, do we?</p>

<p>It seems as if all of this starts early in life.  As we are going through the different grades in school, there is a marked distinction between students who are in different grades.  Granted, this is all rather necessary because children generally mature and progress according to how old they are.  So it makes sense in that situation.  But the lasting influence seems to be that we feel comfortable with <em>just</em> people our own age.</p>

<h3>Relationships</h3>

<p>This effect can often be seen in the arena of relationships.  Why is it that many of my friends who are girls will not even think about dating a younger guy?  Is it because younger guys is not be great and worthy of her?  Is it because they (the girls) are somehow more mature because they are a couple of years (sometimes a couple of months) older?  I doubt it.  Why do my guy friends only look for girls that are younger than them?  And why is there a floor limit such that they won&rsquo;t even consider girls younger than their specified age?  There are a lot of questions, and there aren&rsquo;t that many answers.  All I know is that it all doesn&rsquo;t make much sense.  People limit themselves by not looking for the things that really matter, the essence and characteristics of a person.  Then they complain that they can&rsquo;t find anyone.  And that&rsquo;s just not right, is it?</p>

<h3>Social Aspects</h3>

<p>People age.  That&rsquo;s the truth.  And it seems like as that happens the reality of death is more apparent.  The chances become greater (on any particular day since the actual chances that you will die are 100%), and that seems to have lend itself to the general notion that young is better.  Even more than that unspoken tendency is that socially we have come to praise the young as vibrant and beautiful.</p>

<p>On the other hand, people who are getting older can always attest that they are getting wiser.  It&rsquo;s true, they should be getting wiser anyways.  They just have more experience, and those with experience know that it counts.  Of course, those who lack it do not think that it counts for very much.  I know, I&rsquo;ve been/am still there.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>But I say that it&rsquo;s so much more important to be young at heart.  Of people that I&rsquo;ve met, young and old, I find myself consistently being convinced that being young at heart is truly the way that I want to go.  I don&rsquo;t want to lose the awe of a child looking at the huge expanse of the night sky or discovering something for the first time.  No amount of time or social constructs can take <em>that</em> away.  Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t be proud of your age sheerly because of your age.  That would make you <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/01/13/proud-of-nothing/">Proud Of Nothing</a>, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>So really there are 2 ways that you can deal with age:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> <strong>Wine</strong> &ndash; get tastier and more valuable with age</p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Cheese</strong> &ndash; get moldy!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Haha I know, I&rsquo;m just good at making up strikingly accurate analogies.  You don&rsquo;t need to tell me twice.  No really, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
