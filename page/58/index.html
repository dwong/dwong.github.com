  <div class="entry-content"><p>Isn&#8217;t it strange how when someone suggests something, and you can respond by saying &#8220;I&#8217;m <strong>up</strong> for that&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m <strong>down</strong> for that&#8221; it will be interpreted with exactly the same meaning?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As many of you know, it is difficult to persuade other people to do things.  Whenever you want someone to do something for you (or for anyone for that matter), it can easily be seen that there is some opposition (small as it may be).  It doesn&#8217;t even really matter what it is.  It&#8217;s merely the fact that they&#8217;re being asked to do more than they expected.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve discovered a solution of sorts in the last few years.  So perhaps it&#8217;s not exactly a solution so much as it&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/tag/tip-for-life">tip for life</a>.  Basically I have found that people are much more willing to do what you&#8217;re asking of them if you&#8217;re also willing to do a part.  If you want someone to drive you somewhere, they&#8217;d be much more willing if you drove to their place and offered money for gas (which is getting ridiculously expensive, in my honest opinion).  If you want someone to clean, you are going to have to get down and dirty as well.  If you want someone to run an errand for you, they&#8217;d be more amicable if you&#8217;re someone who has done errands for you.  The examples go on and on, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>Now this obviously will not work with everyone in the world.  But it is something that I think some people could learn from.  Nobody wants to be bossed about as if they mean nothing.  So you can&#8217;t expect people to go 100% while you go 0%.  Think about it, and see if it works for you.</p>

<p>Start to do things for yourself and thus <strong>become the better person</strong> simply because it pays off in a lifetime of independence and rewards.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you been <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancingwiththestars/index">Dancing With The Stars</a>?
I&#8217;d rather travel to Mars.
Oh how fun that&#8217;d be!
Perhaps instead I&#8217;ll cross the sea.
To the tropical vacation of fame
Maybe there find a classic dame?
Or maybe win a trip to the country of my roots.
Where I could buy some nice designer boots
Or more likely a fake designer bag.
Oh but veritably on the U.S. market that is a drag.
I don&#8217;t agree with the ways of fakes.
But I like to eat lots at classic old bakes
Or barbecue meets for that matter!
Brazilian versions might make you fatter.
Work it off by learning to dance.
Get on Dancing With The Stars? Not a chance!
Or instead of all of that, you can sit in your house.
But if a fire comes, with water you will douse.
Those wood fences are ideal but trouble.
Especially if the fire bursts your bubble!
Perhaps the answer is a fence not wood.
Something different to put up in your neighborhood.
I&#8217;ve heard of vinyl fences, they might be it.
Now I&#8217;m tired of doing this rhyming bit.
So take it or leave it, your life or this one.
Whatever the case, right now I am done!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although not exactly new, something that I&#8217;ve recently added to my blog is tags.  Hopefully you (the reader) will find them useful when looking through my site.  These are specified by me each time I write a post, and I am trying to make them as high-level descriptive as possible.  I also noticed that while updating the posts written previous to installing <a href="http://ryanlee.org/software/wp/croissanga/">Croissanga</a> (which cross-posts snippets of my entries to xanga), they were getting added to xanga as new entries because they were not previously known to Croissanga.  Oh well, maybe it&#8217;ll give people a chance to re-visit my old entries.  I, for one, thought they were interesting.</p>

<p>Anyways, on to more about the tagging.  I&#8217;m using a plugin called <a href="http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior">Ultimate Tag Warrior</a> (how awesome of a name is that??) to handle the tagging duties.  For the user, I am displaying the tags in a &#8220;tag cloud&#8221; on the sidebar as well as with each post.  The way that the tag cloud works is that it has a list of each tag available.  For the tags that are least used, I have set it to show up as more gray and in smaller text.  Proportionally as the tag is used more and more, the text is larger and more black.  This, in my opinion complete surpasses the functionality of the previous &#8220;categories&#8221; because it gives a visual representation rather than simply a list of categories.</p>

<p>On another note, I know that I&#8217;ve been talking a lot about the plugins that I have on my Wordpress installation, but don&#8217;t worry because I will soon write a post describing all of my plugins in an easier to read list.  Of course, that would be more interesting to those that are actually interested in a little of what makes this blog.  Or it might appeal to those on the Internet searching for a list of someone&#8217;s setup, though I know that there are countless such pages already existing&#8230;</p>

<p>On an even different note, I&#8217;ve gotten a little feedback with people saying that they don&#8217;t like the &#8220;Click to read the rest of this entry&#8221; where it cuts the entry off and forces you to the permalinked page.  I wanted to explain it and give more people an opportunity to give some feedback.</p>

<h2>Reasons for including snippets of each post on the front page as well as on Xanga</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>It keeps the &#8220;Home&#8221; page <strong>shorter and cleaner</strong> in my opinion.  If I didn&#8217;t only post the snippets, then the front page would be ungainly in my opinion.  To keep it short, I would only include 1 or (possibly) 2 posts.  This would just lead to people clicking links to see older entries!</p></li>
<li><p>It <strong>forces people to my site</strong> when they&#8217;re reading through Xanga.  Why would I want to do this?  Well I like to know who is reading my website (at least a hit or <em>something</em>) or that <em>anyone</em> is even reading my blog.  After spending the time to write my entries and put up this blog, I think that I&#8217;m entitled to at least know when people are looking at it!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now the main reasons that I&#8217;m hearing that people don&#8217;t like to do this is because they either want to remain anonymous and just read it without having to ping my site itself as well as it takes too much trouble.  In response to the first, you&#8217;ll just have to get over it.  It&#8217;s not as if I&#8217;m the CIA and trying to track you or anything.  You&#8217;re mainly just a number (okay a little more than that because of <a href="http://www.statcounter.com">Statcounter</a>) but you don&#8217;t have to worry too much about pinging my site.  And in response to the second reason, you&#8217;ll just have to stop being so lazy.  Computers make your life easier already.  How hard is it to click one link, and then hit the &#8220;back&#8221; button on your browser after you&#8217;re done?  It&#8217;s not hard at all, that&#8217;s what it is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[i-<strong>gree</strong>-j_uh<em> s, -jee-</em>uh_ s]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>Extreme or monumental in some negative way.</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>Now some people will forget things on their vacation, but forgetting your credit card and money is an egregious mistake.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>I think that this word is pretty useful in everyday language.  Now we might not necessarily encounter things that can be termed &#8220;egregious&#8221;  every single day.  However, it can be useful in order to reference things that could possibly happen or that have happened previously.</p>
