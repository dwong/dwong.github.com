  <div class="entry-content"><p>Because of computers, life has changed over the years.  They hold the promise of many things.  Quicker processing, automated functions, extensive memory are just a few of the available positives of them.  While they have changed and are continuing to change, people do not change quite as much.  Sure we change because now we know how to find things online whilst 20 years ago the common person did not.  However, the very essence of people will not change.  Take today for example.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/18/pf/taxes/intuit_turbotax/?postversion=2007041811">an article</a> that I read, we see just how people do not change.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hundreds of years ago, the roads must have been clogged with people traveling by foot/horse to get to the local magistrate to pay their taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>Years ago, the post office was jam packed with lines out the door as people stood in line to mail their taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>Today (figuratively, yesterday literally) countless people try to file their taxes in the hours before the tax deadline and clog up the servers.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It is amusing to see that people will truly not change.  If they can do things faster then do they finish them faster?  No, they wait to start it later.  People never learn.  We truly are running around in circles and simply staying in the same place.  Boy, we must be dizzy by now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a lot of things that people do well.  Well, at least it seems like they do a lot of things well.  Maybe in hundreds of years people will think back upon our times and scoff at how poorly we existed.  That&#8217;s kind of how we look back on other time periods isn&#8217;t it?  Using a port-a-potty is bad enough, but a bedpan or an outhouse?  No way!  Using candles instead of having electricity?  Completely necessary!  But I digress (as usual).  Something that makes me angry is that people <em>are</em> too good at things.  They are good at wanting as much money as possible.  They are good at looking out for #1.  They are good at being sneaky.  They are good at marketing.</p>

<p>What brings on this rant?  Well the gas stations!  You might think, &#8220;how in the world do gas stations market?&#8221;  Well I have some beef with gas stations.  Okay so maybe I also just have a problem with how gas is very expensive (and going up).  Nevertheless have you ever noticed the prices for gas?  Sure sure, we all know that they are currently low to mid $3 per gallon.  But have you ever noticed that it&#8217;s always something like $3.199?  Do you realize that&#8217;s essentially $3.20?!  If you think that I&#8217;m being stupid, then that&#8217;s your prerogative, but I think that&#8217;s slightly outrageous.  Do they really need to get that last 0.9 ¢??  And we are silly and oblige because we have to.  How unfortunate to be bound to something (gasoline) so tightly!</p>

<p>Too bad ranting and raving will do nothing to stop this practice.  It&#8217;s absolutely worthless.  I wonder who is getting rich from the 0.9 ¢ extra from every single gallon pumped.  They sure must be rich.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[<strong>kas</strong>-ti-geyt]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>To strongly criticize or reprimand.</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>After running into the street, some people think that the parents should just send them to the corner, but others are of the mind that the child should be castigated in order to more strongly deter future injurious behavior.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>Using a new word instead of criticize seems like an attractive possibility.  Seemingly of the old English variety of words, it flavors your language, and I&#8217;d warrant to say that it might make you sound more sophisticated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When we wake up and start our morning routine, we are always presented with a decision.  Of course, we are presented with many decisions each and every single day, but I am talking about a particular decision.  The decision that I am talking about is what to wear.  We try to match clothes based on the society-specified norms of matching colors and matching patterns.  We know that jeans match pretty much everything, do not wear brown with black, iron out the wrinkles in the clothes, and so on and so forth.  Why do we do these things?  Does it intrinsically make us better people?  No, not really.  Do they, at the very root of the matter, make us more acceptable to the world?  I would venture to say that is the case.</p>

<p>If you really think about it, that is very much what we are doing.  We are trying to be accepted by the world.  But I am not saying that it&#8217;s necessarily a bad thing (although it definitely sounds like it from what I just said).  The real reason why I bring this up is actually not obvious at first glance.  I want to specifically address choosing your accessories.  Though this might be more specifically applicable to those of the fairer sex, it can definitely be taken to apply to anybody&#8217;s life.  Almost all women that I know will carry a purse with them whenever they go out.  They have their fancy purses for going out when they&#8217;re dressed up, and they have their casual bags for when they&#8217;re just out running errands.  Whatever the case, I feel as if I have seen that there are a large number of women that I know that have this decision to make.</p>

<p>I want to address something that I only recently really thought of because of some comments that I recently heard.  Now first off, there are many, many bag makers out there.  There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.coach.com/">Coach</a>, <a href="http://www.dooney.com/">Dooney and Burke</a>, <a href="http://www.prada.com/">Prada</a> (what kind of a site is that with <em>just</em> a picture??), <a href="http://www.louisvuitton.com/">Louis Vuitton</a> and so many more (I claim the defense of having sisters as the reason for knowing all of these).  There are probably a lot of people out there who have a problem with how expensive these purses are.  I mean, $300 for a bag that can&#8217;t even carry a classic novel is pretty amazing.  I still think that&#8217;s pretty ridiculous.  But even more extreme than that stance is the one where the people that carry these bags are being wordly and shallow.  Now this might be true.  I&#8217;m sure that it is for some people.  And at this point I am certain that some people will be thinking &#8220;but, Derek, it&#8217;s worth it because of the exceptional build quality!&#8221;  But that is a debate for another time.  The reason that I bring up the fact that some people think these things is because I want to bring up another thought.  I want to say that people who despise the worldliness of these bags but wear fake bags are even more worldly.</p>

<p>By buying fake bags and wearing them as if they were real, I want to propose the idea that these people are trying even harder to please the world than anybody else.  Of course on top of being more worldly, they are harming the innovative industries that produce these bags.  But I digress.  So I think that there is a place for thriftiness in this world, but I have come to have a fair amount of opposition to those that partake in purchasing fake things (such as purses).  The reason that I think that these people are even more worldly is that they can&#8217;t even claim to have bought these purses for the right reasons (spending their money on something that is actually better quality and some would say a better value than buying many bags at a cheaper price).  All they can say is that they bought it for cheaper.  They bought it for cheaper even when they could have obviously bought an equally cheap bag that did not have deceptive designs and logos on it which were put there to meant to imitate the more expensive bags.  Instead, they bought the fake designer bag in order to purposely try to put up a front.  And for that they earn the derision that they deserve.</p>

<p>Do you think that this doesn&#8217;t apply to you?  Well you should probably think about it again.  Fake clothes are equally if not more of a culprit.  And in this area, all people are susceptible.</p>

<p>Why do people do it?  Why do we want other people to like us and accept us more?  At the very root of the matter is perhaps a discomfort with who we are.  A deficiency in self-confidence at the very core of who we are might be to blame.  It might take some digging to get at the root, but just like all plants there is always a root somewhere.</p>

<p>Does this mean that we should not buy anything more expensive than the cheapest clothes and the cheapest purses?  No, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the lesson to be learned from this.  I read one time an opinion piece talking about finances and being responsible for your decisions.  The author (whom I don&#8217;t remember) said that we focus on things that seem outrageous in an absolute sense.  We all point out the people that buy cars from Lamborghini or designer clothes as being the most worldly and sinful.  But this same author pointed out the fact that even though the Bible has many passages about money, it doesn&#8217;t actually say that it&#8217;s universally bad for people to have money.  And this author points out that it&#8217;s actually more in line with what&#8217;s written to take the position that it&#8217;s not how much you have, but how well you are taking care of what you have.  And if that&#8217;s true, then the person who buys Starbucks coffee everyday at $3 when they have high-interest credit card debt is as bad (and probably worse) than the person who has saved and bought the fancy new car well within their means.  That sounds like it&#8217;s going out on a limb.  So read it and take it if it&#8217;s good or leave it if you disagree.</p>

<p>What can we learn from this?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t hurt the innovative industries by supporting the copycats.</p></li>
<li><p>Always evaluate why we are buying what we are buying (and why we&#8217;re spending our time, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Live within your means, <strong>whatever</strong> those means might be</p></li>
<li><p>Do not let money take over your life.  It is so easy a trap to fall into.  Fight it with everything within you because there is so much more to life.</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Isn&#8217;t it strange how when someone suggests something, and you can respond by saying &#8220;I&#8217;m <strong>up</strong> for that&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m <strong>down</strong> for that&#8221; it will be interpreted with exactly the same meaning?</p>
