  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just realized that this is the second article that is car-related within the past few days or so. Anyways, I just wanted to say that I am not getting a new car or am involved in the process at all. It&#8217;s mere coincidence.</p>

<p>Anyways, onward with the post.</p>

<p>So I don&#8217;t know about most people, but I do know about me. And one thing that I know is that I absolutely cannot stand it when I can&#8217;t figure something out. For example, I cannot stand it when I lose something because that is in essence a puzzle (the location of something) that I cannot figure out. It will consume me to no end!</p>

<p>So for the past couple of months, I have been slightly perturbed by a puzzle. No it&#8217;s not a puzzle in the normal sense. Basically I would drive around southern California and obviously see lots of cars. Now occasionally I would see something that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/213/473834904_46f6265569_o.jpg" alt="op.permit" />
I blurred out the important information because I just yanked the picture from some random site.</p>

<p>Now I always wondered what it was. Now obviously you can see what it is now because I found a picture for you and it&#8217;s not moving at 70 mph. But imagine it as something 6 inches square and on the back window of a car and moving exceptionally fast. Plus you don&#8217;t want to get too close to it else you might get into an accident! And although I would see them around some of the time, I never really saw them in a context by which I could actually look at it.</p>

<p>And so my mind imagined what it could be. Some of the things that I thought of were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#8217;s a secret club for something and that badge indicates that they&#8217;re in the club</p></li>
<li><p>My eyes were playing tricks on me</p></li>
<li><p>It was a new hip brand of clothing/auto accessories/whatever</p></li>
<li><p>It was a humorous bumper sticker type thing</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So basically my mind would stew about it for a few minutes every time that I saw one of these things. And this went on for a couple of months! Of course I tried to remedy this all by searching for it on the Internet, but you can imagine how hard it would be to find it. Basically all I knew was that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It was red</p></li>
<li><p>It had a number on it</p></li>
<li><p>It was on the back of cars</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Now those are some pretty broad and sweeping search terms by which my search engines could not help me with. Alas, I was to be forever confounded&#8230;</p>

<p>Until <strong>finally</strong> one Sunday I saw one of these on the back of a car in the parking lot of <a href="http://www.fcbc.org/">First Chinese Baptist Church</a>. I took the minute or so to read it and discovered that it&#8217;s a DMV Temporary Operating Permit! I promptly felt satisfaction seep over me like a gentle wave. :P But truly I do enjoy it when things make sense, and those moments when realization set in are very nice indeed.</p>

<p>Even with the knowledge of what these were, it was still hard to find information about them online. I must admit that I still don&#8217;t know all that there is to know about these, but I don&#8217;t really care that much anymore because I know <strong>what</strong> they are. Hopefully if someone is in the same conundrum as I was, they will happen upon this page and be satisfied as well.</p>

<p>Anyways, it&#8217;s interesting because I&#8217;m like that with other things as well. The truth really does set you free! (Even if it&#8217;s a small dose of it.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry about the downtime both today and last night.</p>

<p>Last night I was upgrading to <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn">Feisty</a> so it was taking a lot of the bandwidth away from my connection.  Thus it would be hard for people to have snuck in and successfully got back the pages that they were looking for without timing out.</p>

<p>And then sometime early this morning, my home DSL connection somehow died.  And I didn&#8217;t realize this until I was at work.  And that meant that nobody was physically around to restart everything.  Ah the downfalls of hosting your own site on a home connection.  It was pretty good for quite sometime.  I didn&#8217;t need to restart (and renew my IP address) for possibly a month or two?  That&#8217;s pretty good.  Well at least for me anyways.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to our regularly scheduled program!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a list of Wordpress plugins that I both use and recommend to anyone who is interested.  It&#8217;s not exactly a typical setup (but then again what fun what a &#8220;normal&#8221; setup be?).  Even if you don&#8217;t have a Wordpress blog, feel free to read the list and find out about some of the software that is powering this blog.  Maybe you&#8217;ll discover some features that you didn&#8217;t know about!</p>

<p>And onward (not in order of preference or importance but rather just so that you can make sure that I have 13).</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://akismet.com">Akismet</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>The  ubiquitous spam comment catcher for the Wordpress community.  It&#8217;s so popular and well-done that it&#8217;s a default plugin.  I didn&#8217;t actually activate it initially because I didn&#8217;t think that I needed it as my blog doesn&#8217;t have extensive traffic.  And thus I didn&#8217;t think that I would get picked up by any spammers.  Of course I turned out to be wrong.  And of course I got spammed hundreds of times.  And of course it happened while I was on vacation.  Ah &#8216;tis life.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://ryanlee.org/software/wp/croissanga/">Croissanga</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Not a normal plugin to have I would think.  But this is definitely a crucial one on my blog because of the community (small as it is) that I have on <a href="http://www.xanga.com/">xanga</a>.  I enjoyed installing it because it allowed me to learn about <a href="http://php.net/curl">PHP cURL</a> (which is basically a way for you to access remote sites through PHP!).  Additionally it definitely upped my readership and got the word out there about my blog.  This is better than having to tell people about it.  It gets old telling people to check out my blog.</p>

<p>With some fairly prompt response to my report that Croissanga wasn&#8217;t working (within the week), Ryan stepped up and pushed out a new version to handle the changes.  That is just sweet.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://orderedlist.com/wordpress-plugins/feedburner-plugin/">Feedburner Feed Replacement</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Replacing the default RSS feed is useful because you can track more information by sending the feed through <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>.  Very easy to set up, and there are some interesting things that you can learn through them that you wouldn&#8217;t if you hosted your RSS feed on your own site.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://blog.jodies.de/archiv/2004/11/13/recent-comments/">Get Recent Comments</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>This is a very useful plugin, in my opinion, because it gives you the ability to bring the comments part of your blog to the front and center (the main home of your blog).  I encountered this by seeing it on other people&#8217;s blogs and thinking that it was very handy.  You know when I publish a new post, and now you can know when someone else adds a new comment!</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://dev.lipidity.com/feature/wp-plugin-gregarious">Gregarious</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>There is something that is very hot lately in the world of the Internet.  If you haven&#8217;t heard of it, it&#8217;s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Bookmarking">social bookmarking</a>.  Basically it&#8217;s a way for people to share what they find interesting with other people.  This plugin allows your posts, pages, etc to have an instant connection with such sites as <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a> or <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a>.  I have this on my blog because I think that it&#8217;s cool and I try to participate in social bookmarking.  However, I hardly think that my content is the type of stuff that will get put onto these sites.  But if you feel that it is, feel very free to use the links on the side of each post!</p>

<p>Worked with the author a little on <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/08/i-want-to-share-this/">fixing a slight bug</a> with the plugin, and I really appreciated Ankur&#8217;s responsiveness and work to fix it!</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://mattread.com/projects/wp-plugins/more-smilies-plugin/">More Smilies</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>A plugin that allows you to choose different smilies to use in your blog.  Basic and useful if you&#8217;re into customizing things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://svn.wp-plugins.org/widgets/trunk">Sidebar Widgets</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>This is a big deal right now in the Wordpress community.  Basically it allows you to have drag-and-drop functionality in your sidebar when you&#8217;re setting things up!  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_widget">widget</a> (in the web sense) is an arbitrary piece of code that conforms to some standards and can be dropped into place without any changes.  This is a good way of approaching software projects (where you can just substitute in a component for another component and nothing will know about it), and it&#8217;s also a good way of approaching third party software like plugins.  I am not currently using this too much, but I have every intention of doing so once I finish re-organizing the structure of the site.  I might also have to write my own widget(s) if there isn&#8217;t one to do what I want.  How fun!  But this is seriously a plugin that you should use because it just makes customizing Wordpress even easier than it was before!</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://citizenk.wordpress.com/wp-plugins/statcounter-for-wordpress/">StatCounter for Wordpress</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>An easy way to utilize a free service (<a href="http://www.statcounter.com">statcounter</a>) easily without having to muck around in the source code.  This keeps the code clean while simply adding an action to the Wordpress functions.  This appends the necessary code on each page and thus allows you to keep track of all of your pages!  Very useful for those that like to know what is going on in terms of page loads, hits, etc.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/">Subscribe To Comments</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>This is an interesting plugin that I saw first-hand while looking at someone else&#8217;s blog.  I was interested in it because I found it interesting to stay &#8220;in the loop&#8221; to the comments that were posted as follow-up discussion to the post that I was reading.  Basically you check a box when you&#8217;re leaving a comment, and you will get an e-mail when a new comment is posted.  Pretty nifty if you ask me!</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/">The Ultimate Tag Warrior</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Well first of all the name is just awesome, in my opinion.  Additionally, I think that the functionality is pretty amazing.  Basically it allows you to tag your posts with tags that you create.  Continue to tag your posts and eventually you&#8217;ll end up with a list of tags that somewhat accurately (depending on how good you are at tagging) will represent what your site is generally about.  I really enjoy the tag cloud in the sidebar because it gives a visual representation to how often I tag about certain things.  And from there, if any particular tag is clicked, a new page will display that shows all of the posts that have that tag.  Pretty nifty, if you ask me!  There are numerous other ways to display aggregate tag information, but the plugin is even useful if you just want the tags to display for each post!  It kind of gives a summary of what the post is about.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.lesterchan.net/wordpress/readme/wp-stats.html">WP-Stats</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>This plugin gives a you some statistics to your blog such as number of posts, number of commentators, and the like.  Even though the information isn&#8217;t exactly ground-breaking, it&#8217;s still nice to just have a plugin that will allow you to easily see it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/random-redirect/">Random Redirect</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>This is a really simple plugin in both idea and code.  Basically it allows you to visit http://www.yoursite.com/?random and it will take you to a random post.  I have yet to actually put a link somewhere to use this plugin, but I very much mean to sometime soon.  If you&#8217;d like to, you can try it using <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/?random">a link to a random post on this site</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/">WP-Cache</a></p></li>
</ol>


<p>Although my site doesn&#8217;t exactly get hammered because of all of the traffic, I would still say that this is a great plugin to have.  Basically it will save pages as they&#8217;re visited to a flat file.  What does this do for you, you might ask.  Well a flat file is much easier to serve than a dynamic page generated from PHP and MySQL.  Thus your server will have less processing to do, and it will be able to serve the page more quickly!  Even if your site doesn&#8217;t get a lot of traffic to actually utilize this plugin, there&#8217;s no difference if you do or do not have it.  So I say that you might as well install it.  Who knows, maybe you will get your site submitted to <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a>, and with this plugin you might be able to withstand the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg_effect">digg effect</a>!</p>

<p>I am very grateful to the respective authors of these plugins because it&#8217;s amazing to see how a community (such as the Wordpress one) can make amazing products that are so functional.  I&#8217;ve enjoyed hacking around and making them do what I want them to do, but this is by no means an end to configuring my blog exactly how I want it.  This is just a snapshot of my blog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you like car salesmen?  I don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>They&#8217;re pushy, they&#8217;re slightly overbearing, and they only want to be your friends to make money off of you.</p>

<p>Case in point:</p>

<p>I read an article about an incident that outraged me.  It also solidified my distaste for car salesmen.  In the May 2007 edition of <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/">Car and Driver</a> magazine, I saw an article about a man who went into a dealership to buy a car.  He ended up buying a GMC Canyon.  This man was mentally disabled (he was later reported to have had feces-covered pants on) with a reported IQ (from a relative) of 70.</p>

<p>To buy the Canyon, the man paid in cash (approximately $30,000) and ended up telling the salesman that he actually had a lot more cash at home.  Granted this isn&#8217;t exactly a wise thing to do, but this man was also understandably mentally disabled.</p>

<p>Events proceeded and the man one day thought that his truck had been stolen (when in fact it turned out to have been towed).  He called up his salesman buddy for a ride who then took him to the tow yard.  While driving him, the other salesmen who had conspired together proceeded to go to the man&#8217;s home and steal the money.  They ended up leaving with $70,000.</p>

<p>The police then came to the house to investigate the crime and upon finding feces throughout the house, had the mentally disabled man committed to an institute.  A salesman kindly took the time to go to the institute, get the man to sign over the Canyon to <em>him</em>, and charged him for the time that it took to do so!</p>

<p>Subsequently, lawsuits were brought against many of the salesmen, the dealership returned the $100,000 to the man, and some semblance of justice was served.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, I am still not impressed with salesmen.  <strong>Especially</strong> those of the car variety.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People are ridiculous.  It&#8217;s amazing.  I don&#8217;t even need to cut this entry short because I am speechless at such an act.  Imagine yourself out eating dinner at a nice place.  Then a man runs in.  And then that man proceeds to storm a kitchen, grab a knife, and cut himself.  Even more shockingly, he cuts off his own penis.  Are you kidding me?!</p>
