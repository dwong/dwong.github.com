  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know me, I like going the wong way.  Even in the bathroom.  Want to go the wrong way?  Here&#8217;s how:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Carry on a long conversation with others.  Because that&#8217;s where socializing should take place.  Nobody wants some peace and quiet, they want to get to know you while they&#8217;re relieving themselves.  Or maybe they want to overhear you talking with someone else.  Anyways, it&#8217;s even worse when they&#8217;re talking to you and you&#8217;re both doing some business.  It&#8217;s even worse if you&#8217;re both at urinals.  It&#8217;s even worse if they look at you.  It&#8217;s even worse if there&#8217;s no wall between the urinals.</p></li>
<li><p>Splash human waste around.  You know, get it on the floor, the walls, wherever you can.  Because it&#8217;s not full of diseases.  Besides, it&#8217;s funny.  And there&#8217;s no price too small for a laugh!  And no aiming!  Let others step in your waste.  We like it.  No scratch that, we love it.</p></li>
<li><p>Write obscene messages on the wall.  Because everyone likes to hear what goes on in the minds of the underbelly of society.  We want to know how you feel about your reproductive organs.  We also want to know how you feel about politics.  Really, that is the only reason that we&#8217;re in the bathroom.</p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t wash your hands.  It takes too much time.  It&#8217;s too much of a hassle.  And you&#8217;re a clean person, so it&#8217;s a waste anyways.  Oh and it&#8217;s beneficial because it saves water.  Everyone wins.  Everyone.  Of course, then <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/22/what-to-think/">What (am I) To Think?</a></p></li>
<li><p>Don&#8217;t eat fiber.  It makes you have to poo everyday.  And that is just not productive.  You might as well wait 2 or 3 days and then get all of the pooing done at once.  If it clogs the toilet, oh well!  Someone will fix it.  You&#8217;re actually giving them a job to do by clogging up the toilet.  You&#8217;re supporting someone&#8217;s family!  Do the good deed.</p></li>
<li><p>Get other things done while you&#8217;re sitting on the pot.  Browse your Blackberry, read the newspaper, floss your teeth.  Do what you need to do to make that time more productive.  Yeah that&#8217;s not <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/07/a-scary-thought/">A Scary Thought</a>, is it?</p></li>
<li><p>Leave trash all around.  Waste more toilet seat covers than you need.  Yank on that toilet paper.  (For girls) leave those female hygiene products everywhere but the waste basket where they belong.  Like I said, that&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s job.  You&#8217;re helping out society by lowering unemployment.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So my experiences are a little colored since I don&#8217;t go into the women&#8217;s bathroom all too often.  But you know what?  I think that the facts hold true there, too.  So you can follow these ideas, but then you&#8217;ll be going the wrong way.  As for me, I think that I&#8217;ll keep it clean and sanitary while I go the wong way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As if users did not make enough errors on their own, Microsoft is making life even more troublesome.  I&#8217;d like to know whose bright idea it is/was to automatically restart your computer after the automatic updates!  Oh sure, they give you a random pop-up message that essentially says &#8220;push this button or we&#8217;ll blow up your computer.&#8221;  And it will appear for about 1 minute.  So don&#8217;t you get up thinking that you&#8217;d like to go to the bathroom or anything like that.  Nix the coffee breaks or the fresh air that you might like.</p>

<p>Somehow they assume that you are not doing anything important.  They don&#8217;t save the status of anything nor do they give you the option to opt out completely from automatic restarts.  There&#8217;s a fine line between doing things for the benefit of the user and annoying them to no end such that they want you to just quit what you&#8217;re doing.</p>

<p>It annoyed me before, and it continues to do so.  You&#8217;d think that someone at Microsoft would get annoyed with it and change it, huh?  I guess they don&#8217;t get annoyed.  They&#8217;re too busy being litigious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So as someone who is inside of the office everyday, it is quite rare to get to experience what many people do on a day-to-day basis.  And that is getting to be outside of a building.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a software engineer, whatever that means.  Well I know what that means, but you don&#8217;t really care about it anyways.  In any case that means that I spend much of my day sitting in a chair in front of a computer.  There are some good and bad things about this.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong>: Don&#8217;t waste too much energy, not difficult physically.
<strong>Bad</strong>: Can easily take in more calories than output which leads to fatness and an unhealthy lifestyle.  Additionally, muscles can slowly atrophy such that when presented with a life or death situation where you need to grab onto a bar and hold up both you and your loved ones with one arm, you will all fall to an untimely demise.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong>: Do something that you enjoy - problem solving, thinking logically about solutions to somewhat concrete (but not real concrete) problems.
<strong>Bad</strong>: Get lazy and don&#8217;t experience the other many many other good things in life.</p>

<p><strong>Good</strong>: Don&#8217;t get sunburned, don&#8217;t get skin cancer.
<strong>Bad</strong>: Look like a pale alien unless you actually go out.  However, due to being inside and being so pale it would be even easier to get sunburned if sunscreen is forgotten.</p>

<p>All in all, I don&#8217;t want to be that person that is always inside and becomes lazy.  Good thing for trees that overgrow their boundaries and require chopping!</p>

<p>Oh yeah I was outside over the weekend cutting branches off of trees that were touching the roof.  And you know what?  It wasn&#8217;t too bad.  I felt like a woodsman.  It&#8217;s not going to be a job of mine anytime soon, but I don&#8217;t mind finding a little Paul Bunyan in me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Do you ever think that so much of the time, conversations with other people consist of talking about what you do?  Whether that means talking about what is going on in school, your current job situation, events that you&#8217;ve gone to, and so on, it&#8217;s always rather based on past experience.</p>

<p>And do people read into it and see who you really are?  Well probably sometimes they do.  Nevertheless, it&#8217;s very likely that only your closer friends can actually talk about other things.</p>

<p>When you talk to someone and you have to tell them what you do for a living, you know it&#8217;s not going to be a mind-blowing conversation.  Especially if it&#8217;s because you broached the subject after running out of other things to say.  It&#8217;s even worse if you have to talk about the weather.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You, the one with the Bluetooth headset in your ear.  You, doing anything you can to get a few more car lengths ahead on your commute.  You, with your way of filling up every second of your time.</p>

<p>So you&#8217;re too busy for me (not to mention those in your life who care about you)?  Even though it&#8217;s actually difficult not to do at all, it&#8217;s fairly bothersome when someone thinks that they are inherently more important than everyone else.</p>

<p>Get over it, you&#8217;re not that special.</p>
