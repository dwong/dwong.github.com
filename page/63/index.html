  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading <a href="http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/top-10-funniest-gadgets">this entry</a> a little while ago, I thought it would be appropriate to list some of my favorites.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/420716497_3166567d7c_o.jpg" alt="ipodtp_2" />
Starting off with a slightly horrendous take on this iPod-centric marketing is this piece of work. To imagine anyone in their right mind buying this is absurd. To think, you couldn&#8217;t live without your iPod for the 5-10 minutes (okay 1 minute if you&#8217;re <a href="http://www.xanga.com/fonghwang">this guy</a> haha) that you&#8217;re sitting on the toilet. Take the time to enjoy your time off from your life. Relax and let it all out. And don&#8217;t touch your iPod before washing or else people will post entries like <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/03/07/a-scary-thought/">this</a> about you!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/420716505_f45089498b_o.jpg" alt="harder teeth" />
See I personally think that something like this is a good idea. I mean our teeth are used in order to break down food that we eat, right? Well these bad boys will do just that. I have a couple of issues with it, however. Firstly, they need to get a model who is not about to fall asleep as she&#8217;s wearing the teeth. Secondly, they need to remedy how extremely ugly you&#8217;ll look when you&#8217;re wearing them. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_%28James_Bond%29">Jaws</a>, anyone?</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/184/420716495_b0438c971d_o.jpg" alt="drivemoticon" />
Here is another gadget that actually seems useful. Unfortunately everyone will look at you like a fool if you so happen to actually use one. Everyone is better off when other drivers are considerate and expressive of how they actually feel. Unfortunately technology cannot make advances in all areas. It has to take a back seat some of the time (pun intended :P).</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/128/420716507_6a407be63b_o.jpg" alt="fresh air machine" />
Oh man, this is awesome. Now I&#8217;m all for having cleaner air to breathe, but there are a few issues that I have with this. First off, what kind of mad person is willing to either carry that thing around or be anchored to one spot for a long time? And more importantly, how in the world does a single plant produce that much oxygen for you to breath constantly? I suppose it might make a tiny bit of sense if you just left it to accumulate fresh air and then you took a whiff every now and again. But even that&#8217;s a stretch.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/421254893_c86d19fdb2_o.jpg" alt="Triumph Japan 2" />
Haha only the Japanese would come up with such a ridiculous invention. (<a href="http://www.triumphjapan.com/release/unique/2006110700166.html">This</a> is why I know it&#8217;s the Japanese who get credit for this one.) There&#8217;s no way underwear should be used for anything other than being worn as such. Come on now, that&#8217;s just gross.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/420716502_8fafc806f5_o.jpg" alt="360 camera" />
One of my favorite! I love the picture. I think that I might have seriously chuckled aloud. And I was by myself. To imagine this being used is actually not all too outrageous because of the high cost of doing this with a device designed for this express purpose. I just would really really like to see someone doing this. I also enjoy how they show you how to truly experience the 360 degree picture that you&#8217;ve taken. :-p</p>

<p>And to think, I always wanted to invent something cool. Why bother when I can live vicariously through all of these other inventors with the fortitude to do something about it?

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just in time for the unveiling of a favicon for this site:
A post about favicons!  :D</p>

<p>Okay so just what is a &#8220;favicon&#8221;?  Well it is basically that small icon that you see next to the url when you go to a site.  There are different icons for different sites as I&#8217;m sure most of you have noticed.  This is basically a special &#8220;ico&#8221; file that is a tiny picture format.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very easy to create one.  At the very simplest you can just go to <a href="http://www.html-kit.com/favicon/">a pretty good online favicon generator</a> and submit a picture to convert.  They&#8217;ll allow you to download the resulting file.  Then to use this file with your site, you have to upload or somehow place the file on your server, and add this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;link rel="shortcut icon"
href="http://example.com/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon"&gt;
&lt;/link&gt;
</code>
to the page that your users will see (typically something like index.html) in between &#8221;<head>&#8221; and &#8221;</head>&#8221;.  Then you would replace the &#8220;http://example.com/favicon.ico&#8221; with the corresponding path to get to your file.  And that&#8217;s it!</p>

<p>Of course you could do things like edit it in the excellent <a href="http://gimp.org/">gimp</a> and add some transparency, etc before you convert it.  And you can obviously use <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/">adobe&#8217;s expensive product</a> to do this (although if you already ponied up for this you better know how to make favicons :P).</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it, you have a nice little personal touch for your website!  Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I saw a license plate frame this morning on the way to work that looked a little like this:</p>

<p> The Few, The Proud</p>

<p>0ZZZ000</p>

<p>  Native Californians</p>

<p>And I was just wondering who in the world was driving this car?  I <em>thought</em> that it was a woman based on the hair that she had, but who knows?  I thought that maybe she was the wife of a marine because there was a large sticker on the window of the marines.  So I was thinking that she likely would be someone who simply was born and raised on California.  However, I wondered about who truly COULD drive a car with that license plate frame.  Would it be the Mexicans (well Spaniards then I suppose)?  Would it be the native Americans (commonly known as the Indians because of one Christopher Columbus?  Can anyone who is born and raised in California proudly bear the frame on their automobile?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m definitely not a fan of someone who proclaims to be something they&#8217;re not (imagine someone who graduates from one school driving around with an alumni frame from another school).</p>

<p>Interesting thought don&#8217;t you think?  I&#8217;ve never seen that license plate frame, and I&#8217;m sure that most people wouldn&#8217;t think much more of it than the fact that they are a proud Californian.  But there seems to be something to it, don&#8217;t you think?  The dislike of people who proclaim to be something that they&#8217;re not.  The truth that you find when you dig a little bit deeper.  Or you find the seeming distaste that people have for thinking further than what their next meal would be.  What a tragic life.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[uh-<strong>plom</strong>, uh-<strong>pluhm</strong>]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>Poise, composure, or self-assurance.</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>Having to process 1,000 cases in 2 hours was daunting to say the least, but she handled it with aplomb.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This word is a much more interesting word to use than others, and it seems to be somewhat colloquial in its rather specific uses.  Nonetheless it is an interesting word whose simple structure does not betray its true meaning to the uninitiated (translation: you probably can&#8217;t figure out what it means if you don&#8217;t already know what it means).  It&#8217;s usually used when talking about facing difficult circumstances.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are disasters all over the world, but somehow when there&#8217;s one that&#8217;s closer to home, it changes your perspective.  So apparently the fire that has been going on today in Anaheim Hills is actually not all too far away from home.  In fact, El Modena High School is one of the shelters, and that school is in my distract.  As a matter of fact it&#8217;s probably only 5-10 minutes away!</p>

<p>It makes you think about how things are.  Our lives are based on so much that is simply temporary.  When something changes and we are left with whatever we are left with, then we are left with the choice to decide what is truly important in our life.  What will we choose?  Some of us will choose to pursue a life of pleasure (whether that means obtain &#8220;things&#8221; or satisfying oneself somehow).  Some of us will decide that life isn&#8217;t worth it anymore.  Some of us will continue on doing what we think that we are supposed to be doing just as we have been doing all of our lives (not considering the reason or logic to why we do it all).  Some of us will attempt to live for &#8220;something greater&#8221; (whatever that may entail).  No matter what, it is intriguing to think about the fact that we are not the same once we are under duress.  As it is, a fairly insignificant percentage of people in the United States are actually under hardships such as these that make them re-evaluate their lives.  Have you ever thought about it?</p>

<p>Changes are not usually easy.  Some are even more difficult.  I&#8217;d rather not waste my life, thank you very much.</p>
