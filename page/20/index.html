  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wanting to do something new is an excellent thing.  It&#8217;s often worthy of admiration whether that means keeping a commitment or trying something new.</p>

<p>As the new year has rolled around, there have inevitably been a slew of new resolutions that people have made.  They want to be healthier, they want to be slimmer, they want to be more productive.  Whatever the case is, they are trying to be better than their old selves.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s made me think recently about two of the things that I do: programming working out (well a little anyways).</p>

<p>The thing that they have in common is that they need to be done right.  What is right in a world of relative truths?  Well, Reader, that is a good question.  Right is correctness.  It is the lack of error.  It is proper form, and it is successful execution.  It is, in fact, an absolute.</p>

<p>As people are trying to exercise and get healthy, they&#8217;re trying to do it as quickly as possible.  And often people will burn themselves out with all of the effort that they&#8217;re putting in.  Combined with a poor view (e.g., the goal is not to be skinny, it is to be healthy) and inadequate preparation, this is a recipe for disaster.  By the time that February rolls around, most of the new year&#8217;s resolutions have fallen by the wayside.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no use in trying to do 50 pushups as fast as you can if your form is incorrect.  And there&#8217;s no use in trying to optimize a portion of code when the entire thing doesn&#8217;t work to begin with.  Get back to the basics.</p>

<p>First do it right, then do it fast.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not everyone watches television.  And even more than that, not everyone watches the commercials.  But recently there has been a commercial that contains the quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I finish things.  That&#8217;s what I do.</p></blockquote>

<p>-Clint Eastwood (from the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1205489/">Gran Torino</a>)</p>

<p>While I initially started this post last week, I unfortunately didn&#8217;t finish it before Gran Torino actually released nation wide on 1/12/09.  (How apropos!)  The quote is still interesting, and Clint Eastwood is still going strong as he nears the cusp of 80 years.</p>

<p>I see it all of the time: a carton of milk with a little bit left, a football player getting his arms on a runner but unsuccessfully bringing him down, books on reading lists that never get crossed off, leftover food that eventually rots, a job abandoned before its time.  All of these things are a task unfinished.</p>

<p>Everyday we perform tasks, and everyday we make choices.  The finish line was made not only to be reached for, it was made to be crossed.  Do I sprint, walk, or limp at the end?  Or worse yet, do I not even get to see the end?</p>

<p>Not that I&#8217;m there, but oh that I would live so that when I look back I can see that I made choices for completion in the form of empty plates, finished projects, read books, and tackled runners.  Especially tackled runners.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I do enjoy myself some National Basketball Association.  The <a href="http://www.nba.com/lakers/">Los Angeles Lakers</a> have been doing fairly well, and I must say that I&#8217;m happy about that.  If you&#8217;re wondering, I&#8217;m not a band wagon fan unlike many other people in southern California!</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, I stop and think about the marketing for the NBA.  &#8220;I love this game&#8221;??  Yeah, I&#8217;m sure that they love it so much.  But what if they weren&#8217;t getting paid millions of dollars to play it?  What if they only made the <a href="http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/012528.html">average salary of an American in 2007</a>, which is $50,233?  Okay let&#8217;s be generous and just go with an even $100,000.  I doubt that we would get the talent that we have now because people wouldn&#8217;t devote their entire lives to getting better at the sport.  Parents would force their kids to go through endless numbers of camps and drills in order to just get that perfect arc on their shot.  They definitely wouldn&#8217;t spend every moment of the day in a gym.  Well at least not the majority of them.  I&#8217;m sure that some of them would still work just as hard because they really do love the game.  But I&#8217;m sure that some of them would have to pursue other more lucrative careers that they could be successful at (such as rapping or investment banking).</p>

<p>Love the game?  Yeah, not so much.</p>

<p>How is it that we live in a world where the player of a game (which I admittedly enjoy watching and participating in) can make many many times the amount of money of someone who is saving lives as a fireman?  Or putting their lives on the line as policemen.  Or helping the downtrodden.  Money sure isn&#8217;t a direct correlation to importance in the grand scheme of things, is it?</p>

<p>How inequitable!  But what else can I expect from a world tainted by sin?
  *[NBA]: National Basketball Association, I thought that I already said that!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As many are apt to do, I feel like thinking about time as the new year is changing over.  It&#8217;s interesting how time passes.  In some ways it passes so quickly and things are so different now compared to a year ago.  And in others, it was only a year.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just a year that changes things.  Even a moment has the power to affect a life.  Maybe if I remember that each moment has that much power, the passage of years will be orders of magnitude easier.</p>
