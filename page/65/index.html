  <div class="entry-content"><p>So there are many people out there who watch this show.  I would just like to say that I am both disappointed and satisfied with it this week.  I actually don&#8217;t like watching the results show because I think that it&#8217;s a bit of a waste of time to convey the results in an hour long (or whatever length it is) show.  They use music and dramatic lighting to manufacture something out of nothing, and it is thoroughly annoying.</p>

<p>I thought that Jared was good.  He sounded like Marvin Gaye!  I thought that Sanjaya kid should definitely have been voted off.  He annoys me.  I think it&#8217;d be cool if they had 2 numbers for each contestant, one for voting &#8220;for&#8221; and one for voting &#8220;against&#8221;.  They could take the result of that and use it.</p>

<p>At the same time I&#8217;m glad that Antonella got voted off even though she might have had some questionable photos posted online (which made her a huge topic of search on the Internet).  It proves that there is some decency to the singing aspect of the show (because she was frankly not that great).</p>

<p>I kind of wonder what happens with these people when they return back from American Idol.  Do they just become another &#8220;one of us&#8221; who has had their 15 minutes of fame?  Or do any of them actually get to do something related to singing?  I&#8217;m thinking that some of these people will revel in their temporary spotlight and always bring it up as they&#8217;re becoming a lounge singer or something.  And then there will be (there have to be) some that still aspire for more and end up &#8220;making it&#8221; in some other way (be it a band or a contract or whatever).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s no doubt that the people that i meet in life can somehow scale to the world at large in some way.  That&#8217;s a scary thought when I realize that the man who goes into the bathroom stall next to me didn&#8217;t use a toilet seat cover.  Why is that scary?    It&#8217;s scary because that means that man also very likely will not be that concerned about washing his hands thoroughly (if at all).  So why do I care if this guy (who I have no idea who he is) has dirty nasty hands?  Well because he is representative of lots and lots of people!  There are scores of people walking around out there that similarly don&#8217;t care about keeping their butts from being disgustingly touched by countless other butts.  There are scores of people who similarly will not care about how clean their hands are.  And odds are, some of those people&#8217;s hands will affect me.  Be it the fact that they&#8217;re preparing my food or that they&#8217;re going to shake my hand, they will affect me.  So you see, it affects us all.  There are so very many things that we do that are not just our business.  Drinking and driving, sneezing, not turning on our car lights at dusk, AND SO ON AND SO ON!</p>

<p>Amazing.  And scary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The problem with complainers is that they complain.  Have you noticed the type of people who are willing to make comments or offer up their (often critical) opinion of something without actually trying to do something about it?  I have come to notice that there are quite a fair amount of these type of people around.</p>

<p>In the workplace they manifest themselves as the people who can&#8217;t help you accomplish something &#8220;because it&#8217;s not what they do&#8221;.  Essentially they are perfectly content to let you struggle to do something that you have are new to when they have in fact been working there for years.  They are perfectly comfortable letting you sweat and possibly make mistakes.  Despite all of this, they will be the first ones to come to you if there is a problem.  Accusing, questioning, belittling, it&#8217;s laudable, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>As a friend, they will be the person that can&#8217;t for the life of them ever decide on where to go or what to eat.  They will be indecisive about it all.  However, they will be the first and most vocal critic when something doesn&#8217;t turn out well.  Even if things didn&#8217;t turn out well, they will suddenly realize that something else would have been a better choice for <em>some</em> reason.  They will talk behind your back, they will complain to your face, they will whine, and they will generally not be a whole lot of fun to be around.  More of a &#8220;friend&#8221; than a friend, I&#8217;d venture to say.  And maybe not even that.</p>

<p>In the open source community (and in other areas as well) they are the ones that will look at a product and immediately find the flaws.  Granted the flaws should be found, but they at the same time do nothing but complain about the bugs that exist.  They don&#8217;t try to help out in some way, and they don&#8217;t ever stop bringing up points that are already known.  They will harp on the same issue as if that were the main point, even when it is not.  They are generally ungrateful and quitters who wouldn&#8217;t know how to even start to formulate the product that they feel is insufficient.  They are frankly useless.</p>

<p>These are just examples.  There are countless other examples out there that I&#8217;ve experienced or seen, but for whom I would rather not have to rack my brain to remember.</p>

<p>There are so many instances of this type of person out there that one has to wonder how in the world they can get along.  How can they have any type of relationship with anyone when they have such an unbalanced approach to things?  How high can they really aspire when they don&#8217;t care to do anything for themselves?</p>

<p>I just don&#8217;t really understand these types of people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[fuh-<strong>see</strong>-shuhs]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>Not to be taken seriously or literally.</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>You&#8217;re right, he did say that his room was as big as an elephant.  However, you really need to lighten up because he was being facetious.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>This word is amusingly difficult for some people to say (namely <a href="http://www.xanga.com/godschild1427">Kiki Honda</a>), but it&#8217;s a word that you could use quite often.  Essentially it is an equivalent of saying &#8220;just kidding&#8221; after you say something that was not meant to be taken seriously.  However, one is usually intentionally facetious whereas &#8220;just kidding&#8221; has been known to just be appended after any type of statement.  Facetious is only a word to describe what you are probably already doing.  So now you know what to call it (hopefully anyways)!</p>
