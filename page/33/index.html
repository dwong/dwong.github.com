  <div class="entry-content"><p>Don&#8217;t you hate the feeling that you get right after you realize that you&#8217;ve been caught doing something that you didn&#8217;t want to do?  It&#8217;s that feeling where your blood runs cold for a second.  Yeah, I don&#8217;t like it either.</p>

<p>Even if it&#8217;s something pretty innocuous and unimportant, I think that that I can definitely still get that feeling.  And that is no good at all.  But at least it teaches us that we should just not be doing whatever we&#8217;re doing in the first place.</p>

<p>Then you go through the progression of</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am so embarrassed/ashamed.</p></li>
<li><p>I cannot believe that I did that.</p></li>
<li><p>I hate myself for doing that.</p></li>
<li><p>I am resolved to never ever do that again.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever thought about how life can be different?  Well the other day I was thinking about what our world would be like without our friend fire.  And a very different world it would be.</p>

<p>It sure would be cold.  Haha and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Grylls">Bear Grylls</a> wouldn&#8217;t be able to teach us that fire is so important to survive in the wild.  Hopefully he would still eat crazy things on his show, though.</p>

<p>But once you get past the fact that we&#8217;d all be shivering perhaps you think that it wouldn&#8217;t be so bad because we could have electricity to warm us.  Electric heaters are all over the place, and they certainly do not require fire.  So we wouldn&#8217;t freeze to death and perhaps people could still live in Alaska.</p>

<p>However, there are <em>many</em> things that we would not have in our use.  We wouldn&#8217;t be able to have:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Cars - That sure would change our world, wouldn&#8217;t it?  They&#8217;re currently needed because gasoline engines use sparks to create a small combustion that, through a series of gears and mechanical parts, powers the wheels.  Granted I guess a spark isn&#8217;t exactly fire.  However I&#8217;m assuming that we would have gotten nowhere close to a spark if we didn&#8217;t have fire.</p></li>
<li><p>Food - How in the world would we cook it?  Would we be eating lots and lots of sushi?  Maybe just raw vegetables?  How animalistic!</p></li>
<li><p>Trains - Perhaps you don&#8217;t think that losing trains is any great loss.  I mean who really rides trains nowadays anyways?  Well lest you forget, trains still carry vast amounts of goods across land.  They&#8217;re often supposed to be more efficient than trucks because of their fixed rail.</p></li>
<li><p>Swords - How will the ninjas work?  They&#8217;ll be put out of a job.  But seriously, there would be no metallurgy as we know it because the metal needs to be shaped after being heated&#8230;by fire.  So kiss your katana goodbye.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Fire has got to get a mention in the race for best creation ever.  Without it we&#8217;d be a hungry bunch of people eating who knows what.  And we&#8217;d all be biking everywhere.  Well that would be a good thing because then we wouldn&#8217;t be obese.  But everyone would be walking around sweaty and smelly.  And to add insult to injury, everything metal would be ugly and rough.  Put a chunk of that in your ear and see how you like it.  Makes one a little more thankful for the things that we take for granted, does it not?  Still it&#8217;s kind of fun to have an imagination!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Friends are such an integral part of life.  They are there for us to have fun, to share with, and to truly live our lives with.  And, just as in many of our relationships in life, they can be a source of pain.  I&#8217;m not necessarily saying that I feel that right now, but that doesn&#8217;t discount the truth in the statement, does it?</p>

<p>People have a tendency to let relationships deteriorate.  It takes constant effort and a willing heart to maintain those relationships that might otherwise fall by the way side.  Being a couple of years out of college I can so easily see how much my friendships and relationships with a lot of my friends has done so.  It&#8217;s on the one hand tragic but on the other hand just a fact of life.</p>

<p>Wow I really was thinking that I need some lighter-hearted posts.  Oh well.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my quote, tell me what you think.</p>

<blockquote><p>True friends do not prove themselves in the exciting moments of life.  Hardships and joyous occasions are not where they&#8217;re found.</p></blockquote>

<p>No, the proving ground of a true friend is in the mundane and dull moments of the everyday life.
-Derek Wong</p>

<p>Well I&#8217;ve actually thought about this before, but I had never gotten around to find out whether or not someone else has said it before I have.  As usual, someone probably did.  But it&#8217;d take too long to try to find and properly give them credit.  So if someone else happens upon it, I&#8217;ll gladly give someone else the credit.</p>

<p>Basically all I mean is that it&#8217;s so easy to feel close to people when they&#8217;re going through things that are interesting.  But life consists of only a few of those moments.  It&#8217;s so much nicer to have friends and people around you that actually want to hear about the days when life isn&#8217;t as exciting or exceptionally interesting.  I feel like I&#8217;ve said that before, but it must have been in conversation rather than on my blog.  Granted it&#8217;s even better to just be interesting all of the time, but I digress.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes we have to choose our poison, don&#8217;t we?  It&#8217;s not always blue pill or red pill, sometimes it&#8217;s bad and worse.  In any case, I feel like I must have heard this quote, but I can&#8217;t seem to find its source online.  I think that it&#8217;s pretty good, what do you think?</p>

<blockquote><p>Regret is 10 times worse than rejection.
-Derek Wong</p></blockquote>

<p>For some reason in my head the quote actually is &#8220;100 times,&#8221; but I think that&#8217;s an exaggeration.  I&#8217;m more comfortable with 10 times.  So if nobody has made this quote, and I actually did make up this quote then that&#8217;s just fine with me.  And if someone did say this, let me know so that I can give due credit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d venture to guess that many people choose regret simply because it is the easier of the two.  Rejection is a pain that we all know and despise.  It hurts us upfront and in the short term quite a lot.  On the other hand regret takes some time to fester and build up its power.  And it&#8217;s a longer term pain to boot.  No thanks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently came upon something that made me both excited and sad.  I found <a href="http://groceryguide.com">GroceryGuide.com</a>.  As you know I have previously worked on my own similar application called <a href="http://prices.goingthewongway.com">GROP</a>.  However, as any user can obviously see, I have been beat.</p>

<h6>GROP: My Idea</h6>

<p>Earlier this year, I realized that there was a problem with grocery shopping.  It was too difficult to just jump in and be able to figure out whether or not a particular price was a &#8220;good&#8221; price for an item.  I would have needed years of experience in order to intuitively conclude that a price was good.  And even that is not safe because the human mind (in general) is just not precise enough to remember hundreds of items and their respective prices.  However, a computer would be most excellent at such a task.  This idea was totally my own, and I was in no way influenced by other ideas to solve this same problem.</p>

<p>Therefore I thought that it would be worth a try to create a web application that users would be able to input their prices that they&#8217;ve bought items at.  It would create aggregate data from said application such as the average price bought at.  This would help users to figure out if a particular product was listed at a &#8220;good&#8221; price.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2023/2052843479_bbc0dfc5cc.jpg" alt="groceryguide" /></p>

<h5>GroceryGuide</h5>

<p>And then I happened on a site that had much of what I was doing.  Okay well I haven&#8217;t touched the application in awhile, but we nevertheless had overlaps in our goals and application.  Except it was nicer.  And prettier.  And probably worked better.</p>

<p>The best thing about it, though, was that it didn&#8217;t just have data from users&#8217; input but it actually had all of the sale prices from all stores!  This would have been ideal for my own application except I have no idea how they swung that.  So either they are getting some kind of list from each of the supermarkets, which would have required getting some deal.  Or else they possibly had to create custom mechanisms to scrape their listings online.  I rather doubt the latter, and I am impressed with the former.</p>

<h5>My Feelings</h5>

<p>It&#8217;s an interesting feeling to be passed.  I&#8217;m not sure, but I would think that it&#8217;s a pretty safe bet that GroceryGuide started before I had even had the thought to create my own web application.  And now that it has an upgrade over its previous version, it seems pretty and functional.</p>

<p>I know that in life, getting beat happens daily.  The old get older and the new get better.  In sports, the younger athletes coming up <em>will</em> surpass you some day.  It&#8217;s just a matter of time.</p>

<blockquote><p>Records are made to be broken</p></blockquote>

<p>is a quote that has already been stated, I&#8217;m sure.  And if not, then there it is.  There must be new ideas, new modifications, and so on.  Sometimes the new isn&#8217;t always better.  Just ask Hershey with their <em>Change is bad</em> advertising campaign.  And sometimes that&#8217;s true.  But as a general rule, beware if you&#8217;re the front runner because someone is going to pass you.</p>

<p>Okay so I&#8217;m not the front runner.  In fact, I found it hard to even get people that I <em>knew</em> to use GROP, let alone anyone else.  I had lots of ideas of what I wanted to do, many of which were covered by GroceryGuide already.</p>

<h6>On The Other Hand&#8230;</h6>

<p>There are still things that I benefit from by having my own custom web application.  I can use it to figure out when I last purchased something.  I cover items that are likely not covered by GroceryGuide (can you really seem them having listings from the Chinese supermarket??).</p>

<h6>And Finally</h6>

<p>Mine isn&#8217;t as pretty.  It doesn&#8217;t have as much information.  But there are still benefits.  I think that I should continue to input prices.  However, I kind of doubt that I&#8217;d put much more development time into my project.  There were lots of things that I wanted to do such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make it prettier.  This would have made people want to use it!  People are attracted to good looks, even if they don&#8217;t want to admit it.  This goes for being attracted to people as well.  You know that it does.</p></li>
<li><p>Throw on some AJAX to make it more user-friendly.  This goes along with making it prettier, but it is a bit more than just looks.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve the searching and viewing of data so that users who just wanted to look did not have to go through the same extensive process that users who were adding had to.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In fact, in hindsight I think that I went a little overboard on the database relations because I had a very Web 1.0 mindset of how I wanted to do it.  Oh well, live and learn.  Man this post is full of fun little tidbits of wisdom.</p>

<p>So congratulations to GroceryGuide for having a very nice (from what I can see) application.  And I&#8217;m going to use it.  But you know what, in some ways it&#8217;s still not as good as my own because that one is mine.  But I&#8217;m glad that someone out there is working hard on solving this problem that very many of us have.</p>
