  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a co-worker who I will call Crom (thankfully not his real name).  He is a balding, single, middle-aged computer programmer.  There are numerous things about him that I do not understand.  Some of them are very amusing and some of them are difficult to understand.</p>

<p>I have decided that my own thoughts (while arguably interesting and intriguing) are not the only thing that I want on this blog.  I want to season the meat and potatoes of this blog&#8217;s content with some posts about my everyday life.  You will be able to judge the amusement factor of these posts for yourself.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Crom.  He sits in a nearby cubicle and has been working in this office for over a decade.  That makes his tenure longer than the newer people (like myself) but definitely not as long as the old timers (of which there are a whole lot, some of whom have been around for a couple of decades!).  He works rather autonomously on single-main projects.  I suspect that he and I do not share the same sense of humor.  We also do not share the same idea of manners but more on that later.  For now, just take note of this man as he will very likely come up again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pork is delicious when it means the consumed meat from a pig.  Conversely it is awful when it refers to the appropriations of government money for local projects.  While I might be a big supporter of the former, let&#8217;s not forget that the late Senator Robert Byrd was a huge proponent of the latter.</p>

<p>When he passed, I heard a radio commentator quote an unnamed source from West Virginia saying that they would not know what to do now that he wasn&#8217;t in Washington to send federal funds back to them.  It makes sense for them to think this way because he sent back billions to them during his tenure (Citizens Against Government Waste has a <a href="http://www.cagw.org/newsroom/byrd-pork-tally.html">tally of Senator Byrd&#8217;s pork</a> that will boggle the mind).  So it is true, they just lost a major source of income.  What&#8217;s a person to do?!  I have an idea: start making your own way instead of swiping money from the rest of the country.</p>

<p>I am sure that the people of West Virginia are not the only ones.  There are recipients of pork everywhere, and they should all be ashamed.  This corruption needs to stop.  We all know that politicians are self-serving, power-hungry individuals.  Do not feed them your vote <strong>or</strong> willingly eat their pork!  Does anyone think about the fact that the politicians are taking money from everyone else just so that they can remain in office?  It seems like pork barrel politics could also be called much much worse.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If it&#8217;s true that the importance that things have wavers according to what else is happening then I guess it just goes to show that this blog didn&#8217;t have a really high place in my heart.  While I have been making sure that it&#8217;s still running and checking on it every now and then, I have not written a new post in quite awhile.  But now that I am sitting here in my very own house with this ring on my finger I guess that the blog is rising back up.</p>

<p>I sure am glad because I have not had a public place to air my thoughts.  And that means that either I have been keeping it in or even worse I have not been having any interesting thoughts.  I enjoy writing posts that act as a running commentary on interesting thoughts that I have rather than those of a personal nature, but I figured that I needed to break back into this whole blog thing with something easy.  And what is easier than spilling about what has already happened to you?</p>

<p>So that was my way of saying sorry for not writing, but I was busy buying a house and getting married!  But I&#8217;m back!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nothing gets my blood brewing like unsolicited advice.  Maybe it&#8217;s because I like to try things myself.  Or perhaps it&#8217;s because I just don&#8217;t like other people telling me what to do.  Perhaps it&#8217;s because I get the sense from people giving me advice that they are somehow better than me.  It seems to me that oftentimes the advice giver is simply someone who is older who feels like they must direct the uninitiated, and to me <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/244/age-its-just-a-number/">age is just a number</a> that does not automatically entitle people to give advice.</p>

<p>I know that mistakes are not pleasant.  Sometimes mistakes hurt.  They might even hurt a lot.  But just because something is unpleasant or hurtful does not necessarily make me want to avoid it.  While I do not relish pain, I do appreciate lessons learned.  No lesson is as well learned as one through a mistake.</p>

<p>As I go through life I have grown to appreciate <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/428/pay-me-in-silence/">silence from others</a>.  It&#8217;s a good thing to fall off the bike and get up to try again.  The problem is that people that have fallen off of the bike before do not want others to fall off, too.  They want them to go straight to riding perfectly.  Or maybe they want to ban bikes altogether.</p>

<p>While I like trying things out, I can definitively say that I do <strong>not</strong> know much in this life.  I know some things.  I will learn other things.  And hopefully there will always be people around me that I can turn to for some advice.  The thing is, I only want advice if I ask.  And likewise I will only try to give advice if asked for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I think of basic rights, there are certain things that come to mind.  There is life, which is the right to not be killed without a just reason.  There is liberty, which allows us to have the freedom to do whatever we want to.  And there is the pursuit of happiness, which allows us the freedom to find the ever elusive happiness (granted of course that this doesn&#8217;t interfere with others&#8217; rights).</p>

<p>In this day and age apparently people&#8217;s perceptions of human rights are changing.  We are entitled to a good job (even if we do not deserve or cannot do the work), keeping our house (even when we cannot afford it), health care (even though it&#8217;s an optional service since our right to life is not an entitlement to a set number of years), and <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/10/broadband-access-a-legal-right-in-finland.html">high speed internet</a>.  So while all of these things really deserve their own respective thoughts, I just have to say this: really, high speed internet?  What an entitled and distorted society we live in.</p>
