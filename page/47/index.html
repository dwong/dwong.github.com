  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve made a <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/sitemap.xml">sitemap</a> (which is, if the name doesn&#8217;t already indicate, a map of this entire website).  It includes links to every page available on my site!  The purpose of this is to allow search engine &#8216;bots (computers that &#8220;crawl&#8221; through the Internet so that pages can be found through their search engine) to be aware of all of my pages.  I&#8217;m using the <a href="http://www.arnebrachhold.de/redir/sitemap-home/">Google Sitemaps plugin</a> which will automatically update the sitemap every time I update or create a post.  I&#8217;m also using the <a href="http://www.dicontas.co.uk/blog/google-sitemap-utw-tag-wordpress-plugin/">Google Sitemap - append Tags plugin</a> in order to add the tag pages (where you can see all of the posts with that a tag) to the sitemap.</p>

<p>I think that it&#8217;s cool, although I&#8217;m looking for a better way to order it.  It seems like it should be ordered based on the number of comments because that&#8217;s what I set the option for.</p>

<p>Hmm I just installed the <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2005/07/27/popularity-contest-11/">Popularity Contest plugin</a> to see if I could use that in order to calculate how to order the sitemap.</p>

<p>And now I just easily set it to calculate the priority based on the Popularity Contest plugin!  It uses a priority that is calculated using view count, comments, pingbacks (links to), etc.  I also just realized that the sitemap is just ordered by having the most recently changed posts at the top.  I suppose that this makes some sense since it is for updating the index of the &#8216;bot that is crawling it.  There is no sense in updating the index of a page that is unchanged.</p>

<p>Okay so basically, now you can browse through and check out posts based on their priority.  I just recently made a <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/favorite-posts/">Favorite Posts</a> page, but I&#8217;m not sure if I should still keep it.  Feedback, as usual, is welcome!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[pan-<strong>dem</strong>-ik]</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>To be widespread or pervasive (often referring to a disease) over a very large area</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>As the world fell further into turmoil, the already pandemic fear of war grew in intensity.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>Using this word conveys much more meaning than simply using &#8220;very widespread&#8221; because it it speaks of just how extensive it is.  Often it is used in reference to the entire world because the Greek prefix &#8220;pan&#8221; actually means &#8220;all.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1182/536501267_8897fd1b1f_m.jpg" alt="facebehindtheblog" />I was tagged for the Face Behind The Blog meme by Rory of hamelife.com. I enjoyed reading his, and I realize now that people might enjoy one that I did as well. I must admit that when I stopped to think, I realized that I actually had not put any pictures of myself on this blog. I am some anonymous (presumably) Asian male who writes for this blog. Well well well that&#8217;s interesting. So here we go!</p>

<p>I thought that I&#8217;d post pictures marking periods of change in my life. Oh and sorry that the quality is not very good. It was partly because I don&#8217;t have a quality scanner to get those prints that are only in hard form, and it is also partly on purpose because I don&#8217;t want high quality pictures of me floating around on the Internet. You never know what incriminating things people can do to you. ;-)</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1143/537843608_d7d9d09650_m.jpg" alt="glasses" />
Ah young Derek, eagerly awaiting his birthday cake. I believe it was an ice cream pie. Those are good, indeed. Notice the obscenely large glasses. I believe the proper term for me back then was baller. :P</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1210/537843606_854ee8523d.jpg" alt="before_braces" />
This was taken right before I got braces to fix those horrendous canine teeth. <del>bicuspids. (That would be the canine teeth if you didn&#8217;t know.)</del> I had fun during that time but boy did those canine teeth <del>bicuspids</del> cut my lips!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1061/537843610_f549cce98e_m.jpg" alt="high_school" />
A pictures of myself from high school. Thus marked the end of my strange (for the most part) days. This was taken sometime in the middle of high school. I didn&#8217;t like that time period in my life. But the pictures weren&#8217;t bad.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1080/537843614_1c2ea46538.jpg" alt="in_china" />
Here I am in China, and it is the most recent of the bunch. As you can see, I&#8217;m a much more interesting fellow. I&#8217;d like to think that I&#8217;ve come into my own and am comfortable in my own skin. :D Also notice the advent of the digital camera. Splendid!</p>

<p>So in continuing with this fun game, I&#8217;d like to tag Shelly at This Eclectic Life, Mat at matkishimoto&#8217;s blogspot, Ms. Q at qmusings, and HMTKSteve (strangely enough I don&#8217;t know if his name is actually Steve :P) at Ramblings of the Marginalized. You are by no means obliged to do this. I just thought that these would be some interesting people to see what kind of &#8220;different&#8221; pictures they could put up of themselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a big fan of hugs.  After reading <a href="http://qmusings.com/blog/2007/05/27/are-you-afraid-of-hugs/">Are You Afraid Of Hugs</a>, I went on over to the <a href="http://www.freehugscampaign.org/">Free Hugs Campaign</a> website and discovered a very interesting story!</p>

<p>A man, feeling alone and disconnected from the world, went out to a local place and offered free hugs with a sign.  Now that seems pretty strange if you think about what you&#8217;d feel if you saw someone doing the same.  I know that I would have thought that he was just a creepy guy trying to feel someone up.  But in any case, it turns out that this guy really just wanted to spread the love.  And I think that&#8217;s an excellent idea!</p>

<p>The world we live in truly is disconnected from each other.  We see hundreds of people everyday, and we don&#8217;t even bother to greet most of them.  Even with the people that we do know and talk to, between cellular phones, e-mail, and instant messaging, our communication is distant at best.  We don&#8217;t look people in the eye as often.  And that is just too bad.</p>

<p>Hugs are the antithesis of today&#8217;s mindset.  That is why the Free Hugs Campaign was so revolutionary.  It totally went against the norm.</p>

<p>In short, I like hugs a lot.  Why?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Receiving a hug gives you a certain feeling of being accepted for who you really are</p></li>
<li><p>Giving a hug lets others know that you care about them in a tangible way</p></li>
<li><p>Hugs are something that you <em>could</em> do with just about anyone</p></li>
<li><p>Hugs are free</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Give &#8216;em a chance.  I doubt that you&#8217;ll regret it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well not that I don&#8217;t like all of my posts.  Because I do.  Otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t post it!  But I think that an especially good idea was for me to make a static page of some of my even <em>more</em> favorite posts.  Find the page at <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/favorite-posts/">Favorite Posts</a> where there is a link and a short description of the post.  So go on.  Visit it.  Tell your friends.  Tell the world.  I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re all dying to know how to go the wong way.  :D</p>
