  <div class="entry-content"><p>Trying out a <a href="http://www.reviewme.com">ReviewMe</a> to see how I feel about it.  I like ReviewMe&#8217;s set up because even though they offer to pay you for reviews, they are in no way forcing your hand in what you say.  So good or bad, that&#8217;s how they roll.</p>

<p>One thing that&#8217;s pretty big (okay huge in some places) nowadays is making money off of the Internet.  <a href="http://www.qooforum.com">Qoo Forum</a> is an approach to the issue that (as far as I know) is pretty unique.  They are trying to start a forum where people can talk about anything they want to.  Where does the money making come in?  They propose that if you attain a certain point (currently 50 posts) then they will allow you to have a chance to have ads from your Google AdSense Publisher account be placed on the forum itself.</p>

<p>As I described in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/17/inconsiderate-internet-browsing/">Inconsiderate Internet Browsing</a>, advertisements work just as they do for other media.  Advertisers get to show whatever they want and in turn they pay for that right.  Specifically for the Internet, this means that you can get paid for views or you can get paid for the number of clicks on your advertisements.</p>

<p>The look of the site is nice and clean that is easy on the eyes, even if it does seem a little cartoonish because everything on the site has their edges rounded.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1352/593051503_7dccbd57fa.jpg" alt="qoo_front" /></p>

<p>As you can somewhat see, they are trying to reach out to as many categories as they possibly can.  There are forums within the Qoo forum ranging from music to gadgets to making money to sports!  I think that this might be a problem for them in the future.  Granted it allows for growth in any which way.  However, just like other things with no purpose, it might fall flat on its face just because it does not have a single intention.  I know that I have gone to forums simply because they were forums that were much more centered around a main topic.  That might have been software or cars, but I went to that forum because there were people there that knew more than I did.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s the kind of people that will be attracted to this site.  It seems as if the people that will post here are simply people that are in it to get money for themselves.  It&#8217;s hard to attract the stable reliable posters that are able to answer people&#8217;s questions with that kind of mindset.  The reason is that those people who frequent forums to help others do so out of the goodness in their hearts.  They like helping others.  They are not people who are out to make a quick buck.</p>

<p>However, it does seem like they might have something if my thoughts on people is off.  The advertisements in each thread are pretty well placed.  They blend well with their styling, but they are slightly off-putting because there are just so many of them.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1127/593051101_ae2929d988.jpg" alt="qoo_thread" /></p>

<p>So if you can get an advertisement there, you do seem to have a reasonable chance of making some money.  I&#8217;m sure that Qoo will also be having much of their own advertisements placed in the site as well (of course they&#8217;re revenue <strong>sharing</strong>, not revenue <strong>giving</strong>).</p>

<p>This is all of the &#8220;you scratch my back, I&#8217;ll scratch yours&#8221; mentality.  And that&#8217;s not too bad of an idea because it seems like it was easy to set up with existing tools.  They&#8217;re utilizing <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/">vBulletin</a> for their forum software, they had to think of an interesting domain, they need the hardware to host it all, and then they can utilize Google&#8217;s existing ad network!</p>

<p>Some things that I saw while looking around where that I wasn&#8217;t actually sure how likely you are to get your advertisements on the threads that you start once you hit that magic 50 post level.  In the FAQ it says in one place &#8220;Currently, you are entitled to 50% chance of showing your ad code within the threads that are started by you&#8221; whereas in a similar section it says &#8220;Once you have reached that level, your ad code will be applied to all the threads started by you.&#8221;  That&#8217;s confusing to say the least.  Additionally I noticed some grammatical errors along the lines of some of the items that I mentioned in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/28/learn-some-english-part-1/">Learn Some English (Part 1)</a>.  They should get someone to give it a good read through and through to give it a more professional feel to it.</p>

<p>All in all, I think that the Qoo Forum has an intriguing idea that might turn out to pan out for lots of people.  However, seeing as how they are brand spanking new, I&#8217;m not sure how well they will actually do.  They are working off of people&#8217;s greed, and seeing as how that is very apparent in many people, they just might do alright.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went to go get gasoline yesterday on the way home from work.  Of course I dreaded it.  At least it&#8217;s on the way down right now.  But when I got out of my automobile to start pumping the liquid into my vehicle and my money into the machine, I saw something that took me aback.  There, above the very machine that was essentially taking my money was a television!  It was complete with sound and a fairly sharp display!</p>

<p>Technology is amazing.  They are able to put a television in a gas station!</p>

<p>But then I thought for another second and realized that they must have used some of my money in order to install all of these televisions!  Sure it&#8217;s nice to watch the television for about 2 minutes, but I&#8217;d much rather have the money that they used back!  Just goes to show you that those gas station owners sure aren&#8217;t on hard times.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Meeting new people is a fact of life.  However, have you ever met someone after you initially saw them and recognized them?  Now I might be the only one, but I doubt it.  I&#8217;m not strange enough to be completely alone here.</p>

<p>In any case, I&#8217;ve realized something that I think that we would all do well to know.  Not meeting someone initially creates an awkward environment.  After you&#8217;ve already seen them and come to recognize them without having actually met them is a situation in which both of you know that the other exists, but neither of you feel comfortable talking to the other.  Not having an introduction can come about in a variety of ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Someone didn&#8217;t do their duty when they know both of you and introduced you.</p></li>
<li><p>You are both slightly uncomfortable with meeting strangers.</p></li>
<li><p>Somehow you already know about the other person, but you know that they have no idea who you are.  That makes you afraid to approach them.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Okay I&#8217;m sure that there are more ways that this can happen.  However it came about, if it happens to you you should know that the longer you wait to talk and/or meet the other person, the more strange it will be when you actually do.  So just go for it and introduce yourself.  Remember that they might feel just as strange about without knowing your name while seeing you in the halls.  Or in a group of people.  Or around the neighborhood.  Or living right next door to you.</p>

<p>The only thing that you have to do after that is not forget that you met them.  Because the other person likely did not forget.  And then they&#8217;ll know that you didn&#8217;t care to remember your name.  Or even that they met you.</p>

<p>Meet &#8216;em early, not often.</p>
