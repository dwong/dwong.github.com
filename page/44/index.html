  <div class="entry-content"><p>[blah-<strong>zey</strong>, <strong>blah</strong>-zey]
adjective</p>

<h4>Definition:</h4>

<p>To be indifferent, unimpressed, or uncaring because frequent exposure.</p>

<h4>Example of usage:</h4>

<p>At first the glamor and glitz of living like a movie star was enthralling and exciting, but soon she became blasé even when she would get to fly on private planes to Paris just for lunch.</p>

<h4>Comments:</h4>

<p>A much better word than the more often heard &#8220;blah&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t you say?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And now presenting&#8230;</p>

<p>favorite posts in the sidebar!</p>

<p>Courtesy of the plugin that I used for my sitemap (as described in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/12/a-sitemap-for-you-and-them/">A Sitemap For You And Them</a>), there are now the top (for now 10) posts listed in the sidebar.  &#8220;Popularity&#8221; is a rather arbitrary thing to decide, so my popular posts are based on a calculation using the number of views and responses.  Sometimes this means that the most viewed is popular and sometimes this means that the most commented is the most popular.  Is this useful to you?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was originally going to be titled &#8220;NBA Playoffs (Thus Far Commentary #3),&#8221; but the Cleveland Cavaliers lost faster than I could write this post.</p>

<p>The Cavs were no match for the Spurs.  The real finals happened in the West, probably the Suns vs Spurs series.  LeBron James gets a lot of attention, but Tony Parker was the one who tore it up.  I said as much before the series started that Parker was going to be their downfall.</p>

<p>This was one of the least interesting finals series in a long time.  Instead of watching game 4 last night, I just decided to wash my truck.</p>

<p>The Cavs were so over matched they couldn&#8217;t even pull out 1 game (granted, they were close a couple of times).  Even the Lakers took one from the Suns!  How&#8217;s that for an insult?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1126/548495930_e714338645_o.jpg" alt="Summer photo CC by flickr user Storm Crypt" />I was never one for pro con lists. But maybe I&#8217;ll start. Here is one for the season that is summer. And one caveat to this post is that must know that I live in sunny southern California, so if you live in some forsaken place then you&#8217;ll just have to wish it were different for you. Or you can bask in the cons that I experience and enjoy your freezing cold. Just know this: I wouldn&#8217;t trade places with you at all.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>The sun gives us vitamin D which is needed for, among other things, calcium to be absorbed and used. It also gives you a nice healthy looking glow.
<strong>Con:</strong>The sun causes skin cancer. It also causes wrinkles.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Can make use of those expensive sunglasses.
<strong>Con:</strong>The reflection off of objects is sometimes glaring, especially if we forget to bring those expensive sunglasses.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Have more sunlight to play with (or in).
<strong>Con:</strong>Having nobody to play with.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Summer love.
<strong>Con:</strong>Not having anyone to love. Or more likely, having nobody to love you back.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Sitting out, enjoying a nice drink on the proverbial porch.
<strong>Con:</strong>The stupid bugs that will eat you alive.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Vacations to far off places.
<strong>Con:</strong>Not having any vacation time. Or having no job and plenty of &#8220;vacation time,&#8221; but obviously having no money to vacation with.</p>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong>Cruising in your car, looking cool.
<strong>Con:</strong>Not having had any rain for a long time, so your car is dirty. Your speakers are not loud enough to make anyone glance again. Your car is laughably unimpressive. You look like a fool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I enjoy open source applications for a number of reasons.  And they don&#8217;t really relate to the fact that I program.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They are free.  How could you want to pay for software when you can have it <strong>legally</strong> for free?</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s more agile (updated more quickly) in general.</p></li>
<li><p>It supports freedom and the opportunity for anyone to get into the software market simply by having a good product.</p></li>
<li><p>They are built by a community that by definition is giving and supportive.</p></li>
<li><p>If I wanted to, I could try to understand the code on my own.  Now, I don&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t exactly have all of the time in the world to understand the source code of applications that are extremely complicated (why would I be using them if they weren&#8217;t complicated).  Nevertheless it&#8217;s rather comforting to know that I could.  :P</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyways, enough of why I like them.  Here are some of my favorites!</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Firefox</a> - the now ubiquitous web browser has come out of the open sourcing of the Netscape Navigator.  It is a &#8220;modern&#8221; web browser with pretty much full support for web standards.  Plus I love the extensions that you can add on at will.  Someday I&#8217;ll write a post of my favorite extensions.  But in any case, it&#8217;s standards-compliant, customizable, and supported by a huge community of developers and testers.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a> - an awesome replacement suite for your office needs.  It has all of the programs that you would need if you&#8217;re a Microsoft Office user.  It supports more formats than MS Office does, and it is instantly easy to use for anyone who has used any office productivity program.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">AmaroK</a> - this is an awesome music player.  The only drawback is that it&#8217;s only available on Linux.  It is an iTunes-like player with integration with a myriad of services including automatic lyric retrieval, last.fm synchronization, and wikipedia integration for information about the artist that you&#8217;re currently listening to!  They&#8217;re starting work on porting this application to other systems, but this would be a huge incentive for any music lover to go to linux.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC media player</a> - plays pretty much any format of media that you can throw at it (with the exception of the closed Real media).  It&#8217;s lightweight and it is on any platform that you could have!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://pidgin.im/pidgin/home/">Pidgin</a> - recently renamed from GAIM because of a settlement, this is an instant messaging program that supports lots of different protocols out there.  And that means that you can replace all of your chatting programs with this single program.  Its looks are similar to other projects, but it surpasses them in features.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> - the Gnu Image Manipulation Project is a full-featured replacement for your image editing needs.  It can even help you <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/24/passport-pictures/">make your own passport pictures</a>.  Photoshop is ridiculously expensive.  People always cheat and install illegal copies.  This is a great replacement for pretty much everyone out there.  You can even make it look like Photoshop with <a href="http://plasticbugs.com/?page_id=294">Gimpshop</a>!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> - this platform is obviously getting more and more recognition.  I could have stated that I like Linux, but I do in fact just use Ubuntu.  There is a huge community, and it&#8217;s growing quickly.  It is a really easy operating system to use (familiar enough for anyone who has previously used an operating system) with some very good hardware support.  It plays nice with older hardware (the server that this blog is currently hosted on was originally running Windows 98, but now runs quite nicely on Ubuntu).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://apache.org/">Apache</a> - on that note, the Apache software foundation is making some really awesome server software.  It powers quite a lot of the Internet.  It&#8217;s easy to set up and there is lots and lots of documentation out there for its use.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I guess that was basically split up with the top half being the more &#8220;usable&#8221; programs that everyone would want to use while the end was geared more towards specialized uses.  Nevertheless, I think that everyone out there could stand to try out the products coming out of these software projects.  Even if you decide to use your commercial program (which is not a problem if it&#8217;s better and more for what you need) then that&#8217;s fine.  But for lots of people, especially those with illegal software, you might want to try out these programs.  And then you should read <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/14/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid/">Music Piracy Makes People Stupid</a> for a longer post about why I think that cheating, stealing, etc is so despicable.  And then you should own up, repent, and go sit in the corner.  We can all sit there together while we think about what we&#8217;ve done.</p>
