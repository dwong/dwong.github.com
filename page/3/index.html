  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love making things instead of buying them. First I made a <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/643/diy-camera-bag/">stealthy camera bag</a>.  And here I am making a better strap for my DSLR.  I was inspired by looking around the Instructables website at other people&#8217;s camera straps.  In particular, I was fond of the variants of the highly regarded <a href="http://amzn.to/NoFYby">R-Strap by Black Rapid</a>.</p>

<h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
<li>Sew nylon strap through swiveling hook with a box stitch</li>
<li>Attach locking carabiner to swiveling hook</li>
<li>Thread shoulder strap through both nylon strap and carabiner</li>
<li>Cut original Canon strap, leaving enough room on the thick portion for a grommet</li>
<li>Cut hole in thick portion, not too close to the edges</li>
<li>Insert and attach grommet</li>
<li>Attach skinny nylon strap of the original Canon strap to the camera</li>
<li>Attach grommet on thick portion of original Canon strap to the swiveling hook</li>
</ol>


<h4>Parts</h4>

<ul>
<li>Grommet kit ($7, Michael&#8217;s)</li>
<li>Included Canon strap (free or less than $10, eBay)</li>
<li>Swiveling hook ($4, Home Depot)</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/Rz7V35">Locking carabiner</a> ($5, Amazon)</li>
<li>Nylon strap (free, cut from an old messenger bag)</li>
<li>Thread (negligible, already had)</li>
<li>Shoulder strap (free, already had)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I enjoyed making this, especially when compared to the ~$60 R-Strap.  It saved me some money.  (Then again, that small amount of money saved hardly gets me very far in terms of purchasing new lenses!)</p>

<p>My main issues with the commercial R-Strap is its price and its attachment to the tripod mount.  I don&#8217;t particularly trust screws to hold my camera, especially since it swings and hangs there.  Additionally, it is quite difficult to put a camera on a tripod with something else attached to its tripod mount!  This strap attaches to one of the metal tabs that is normally used for holding up the camera.  It&#8217;s integral to the camera body, and I trust that it won&#8217;t break.  If it does break, then it would drop just as it would have if I were only using the original Canon strap.  In any case it is a pretty secure setup, and I will be using this for the time being.</p>

<p>A lot of my inspiration is from the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.comhttp://www.instructables.com/id/Safer-DIY-R-Strap/">Safer DIY R-Strap</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People want their private space.  People <strong>need</strong> their private space.  Some people have even been known to go crazy without it!</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are people who do not seem to really understand the whole personal space thing.  My co-worker, Crom, is exactly one of those people.  I don&#8217;t know if I would go so far as to say that he enjoys getting all up in people&#8217;s business (and by business I mean personal space), but he definitely does it the majority of the time.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s even worse for the short ones!  He is pretty tall (over 6&#8217;) and has a bit of a portly stomach, which I would imagine would make shorter people feel like he is intruding into his space even more if his stomach is near their face!  Thankfully I am not at that height.  Interestingly enough <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/914/crom-the-one-with-the-girlfriend/">his girlfriend</a> <strong>is</strong> pretty short at (I&#8217;m estimating) 5&#8217;2&#8221;.</p>

<p>The best part is getting to watch Crom do this to other people.  Unbeknownst to him, I observe him and amuse myself  with all of it.  What can you learn from all of this?  Beware of the watchful ones since they are probably analyzing and making fun of you in their head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Beijing is well-known in recent history for hosting the 2008 Olympics.  It is very populous.  On another note it apparently is a hugely popular destination for Chinese people from other parts of China.  They were everywhere, and it was not that pleasant to be around them all of the time.  Yeah, that part I just loved.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some pictures from my recent vacation to Hong Kong.  I have decided that it would be a good idea to start posting more pictures (since I have started taking them).  I played with the idea of watermarks for awhile, but I eventually settled on just including something small.  In any case, we&#8217;ll see how this goes since it seems as if the blogging has started to peter out.  Let me know what you think!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like having friends.  They usually share some connection with you and are able to share in experiences with you.  Laughter, excitement, and life all happen when friends are around.</p>

<p>But something that I am continuing to learn is that friendships will change.  As in, you will change.  Or the friend(s) will change.  Or circumstances will change.  Maybe you just stopped trying.  Maybe they slighted you in some way.  All of this adds up to your friendship changing.</p>

<p>So apparently I am much worse than I thought I would be at maintaining friendships.  People have come and gone in my life.  Some have left a mark (and amusingly many have not).  Many are now gone.</p>

<p>Now looking back on times long gone, I realize how difficult it would have been to predict how my life would have turned out.  Even if things had been planned or more effort would have been invested, I know that it would have been quite difficult to overcome what has turned out to be the biggest reason for all of the change: <strong>life</strong>.</p>

<p>Proofreading this post I have come to the conclusion that this could have been written by a lovesick high school kid secretly talking about some girl he had a crush on who just stopped talking to him even though all indications were that she liked him.  Not that I have that experience, I&#8217;m just saying.</p>
