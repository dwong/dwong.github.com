<div class="entry-content"><p>So after more time than I&#8217;d like to admit, I&#8217;ve finally finished enough of my theme to put it on goingthewongway!  I&#8217;m excited that I&#8217;ve changed it.  Check it out and let me know what you think!</p>

<p>And now I present to you: Soi-disant</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only changed my theme once to (Not So) Fresh as I posted in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/09/new-look/">New Look</a>.  That was 8 months ago and since then quite a bit has changed.</p>

<h5>Why I wanted to make my own theme</h5>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h6>Have a unique look to my blog</h6>

<p>I&#8217;ve come across other blogs that had the same theme, and that wasn&#8217;t too exciting for me.  I want and like to be my own.  So even though the last one did look nice, it was unfortunate because other people thought that it looked nice as well.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h6>Learn much, much more web design</h6>

<p>CSS in particular, HTML and PHP to a lesser degree since I already knew a fair amount before doing the theme.  Part of who I am wants to understand how things work and why.  So learning new things can be very exciting to me.  Not to mention the fact that it&#8217;s very pertinent to my profession of computer programming.  (Although I must admit that I believe that I lack the creativity necessary to actually ever become a web designer.  I know the nuts and bolts but lack the vision.  :P)</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h6>Create a fluid display</h6>

<p>I wanted one that would show up well on the very popular 1024x768 and 1280x1024 screen resolutions in addition to any other screen resolutions.  I&#8217;m sorry to say that it&#8217;s very likely that anything below 1024x768 won&#8217;t look all that great.  A fluid display means that the text and page elements will expand according to how much space is available.  My previous theme was fixed width so it didn&#8217;t look too great to me on higher resolution displays.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>


<h6>Speed things up</h6>

<p>The last theme used a fair amount of images to create all of the nice effects.  And that&#8217;s nice for people on fast connections (which at this point is a very fair amount of people).  However there still are people on slower connections, and I want my blog to be accessible to them as well, too.</p>

<h5>Soi-disant</h5>

<p>I got the name of this theme (Soi-disant) by looking up a word of the day online.  Lame, huh?  I thought it was cool because it means calling oneself thus, self-styled, or so-called.  Seemed interesting to me so there it is.</p>

<p>So I did it all for this theme: header logo, PHP code, HTML, CSS.  It was a learning experience, that is for sure.</p>
