<div class="entry-content"><p>You know what is disconcerting?  When someone is just looking at you.  I&#8217;ve noticed this while being both the looker and the lookee.  (I just made that word up but I could have actually made that into more proper English.  Sometimes I&#8217;m just a rebel like that.)</p>

<p>So when you&#8217;re doing anything, whether that&#8217;s talking to someone, eating, studying, or anything in between it is quite interesting to suddenly look up and see that someone had been staring at you.  You know that they&#8217;d been staring since they would not have been making a looking motion just as you&#8217;re looking.  So if they look away quickly or even if they keep looking, it&#8217;s bound to make you feel a little bit uncomfortable.</p>

<h4>Why do we dislike getting stared at?</h4>

<p>I&#8217;d say that it&#8217;s likely because we, as humans, don&#8217;t like to be analyzed and have someone witnessing everything that we&#8217;re doing.  We enjoy having some semblance of privacy and freedom to be who we are without being judged.  That&#8217;s the deep reason.  Practically, we just don&#8217;t like being creeped out.  Or other people noticing our flaws.  Like that booger in your nose that you can feel but can&#8217;t pick because that would just be obviously gross.</p>

<h4>What to do?</h4>

<p>Hard as it might be, I say stare back until they back down.  This sounds like a childish game of chicken, but I still think that it&#8217;s part of a rather fun solution.</p>

<p>Well I suppose that a logical solution would also be to just be comfortable enough with yourself so that you don&#8217;t need to feel nervous or uneasy with someone following your every move.  But not everyone is going to be able to get to that point.</p>

<p>Hmm&#8230;well you could also go the route of blatantly asking, &#8220;What&#8217;s your problem, buster?&#8221; (or some other suitable term for a girl if it&#8217;s a she rather than a he).  But that takes some guts.  And if you&#8217;ve got those guts, you probably don&#8217;t care a lick what they&#8217;re staring at because you have more important things to do.</p>

<p>So most of us are just going to suck it up.  And not know what to do.  And hope that whoever is looking at us is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Not a creepy stalker</p></li>
<li><p>Someone who is attractive so that the staring is more of a compliment</p></li>
<li><p>Not laughing at you on the inside</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Yeah I don&#8217;t have a solution, I wish that I did.  Because then I could utilize it!  If you&#8217;ve got one, let me know because I&#8217;m no fan of this myself.</p>
