When someone is just looking at you. I’ve noticed this while being both the looker and the lookee. (I just made that word up but I could have actually made that into more proper English. Sometimes I’m just a rebel like that.)</p> <p>So when you’re doing anything, whether that’s talking to someone, eating, studying, or anything in between it is quite interesting to suddenly look up and see that someone had been staring at you. You know that they’d been staring since they would not have been making a looking motion just as you’re looking. So if they look away quickly or even if they keep looking, it’s bound to make you feel a little bit uncomfortable.</p> <h4 id="why-do-we-dislike-getting-stared-at">Why do we dislike getting stared at?</h4> <p>I’d say that it’s likely because we, as humans, don’t like to be analyzed and have someone witnessing everything that we’re doing. We enjoy having some semblance of privacy and freedom to be who we are without being judged. That’s the deep reason. Practically, we just don’t like being creeped out. Or other people noticing our flaws. Like that booger in your nose that you can feel but can’t pick because that would just be obviously gross.</p> <h4 id="what-to-do">What to do?</h4> <p>Hard as it might be, I say stare back until they back down. This sounds like a childish game of chicken, but I still think that it’s part of a rather fun solution.</p> <p>Well I suppose that a logical solution would also be to just be comfortable enough with yourself so that you don’t need to feel nervous or uneasy with someone following your every move. But not everyone is going to be able to get to that point.</p> <p>Hmm…well you could also go the route of blatantly asking, “What’s your problem, buster?” (or some other suitable term for a girl if it’s a she rather than a he). But that takes some guts. And if you’ve got those guts, you probably don’t care a lick what they’re staring at because you have more important things to do.</p> <p>So most of us are just going to suck it up. And not know what to do. And hope that whoever is looking at us is:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Not a creepy stalker</p> </li> <li> <p>Someone who is attractive so that the staring is more of a compliment</p> </li> <li> <p>Not laughing at you on the inside</p> </li> </ol> <p>Yeah I don’t have a solution, I wish that I did. Because then I could utilize it! If you’ve got one, let me know because I’m no fan of this myself.</p> </div> <section> <h1>Comments</h1> <div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </section> <div class="related"> <h2>Related Posts</h2> <ul class="related-posts"> <li> <h3> <a href="/cry-room-culture/"> Cry Room Culture <small>May 5</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/the-bear-was-that-baby-on-the-plane/"> The Bear Was THAT Baby On The Plane <small>Apr 12</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/sickness-strikes-again/"> Sickness Strikes Again <small>Feb 19</small> </a> </h3> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/embed.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
