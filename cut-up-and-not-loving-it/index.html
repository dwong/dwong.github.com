Wonder what the heck I’m talking about?</p> <p>So I burned myself while eating a few days ago. And now it’s a bit of a cut (or something that feels like a cut) on the tip of my tongue. This can also be called an apical cut of the tongue. And it’s really annoying.</p> <p>Everytime I move it against my teeth or eat something salty or anything at all, I’m reminded that it’s there. It’s like a little kid who keeps tapping you on the shoulder saying, “Here I am, play with me.” Not that playing with little kids is bad. So maybe it’s more like a little kid tapping you on the shoulder saying, “Here I am, clean up my poo.”</p> <p>So what solution do I have for this? Nothing. I’ve got nothing. But here are some points that I’ve thought:</p> <ul> <li> <p>It’s on the tongue inside of your mouth so that eliminates the usual antiseptic and bandaging for cuts to the skin. Since the mouth is well-known to be full of germs, it is really unfortunate that they’re nothing that can be done about this. Maybe saliva protects it? Maybe not.</p> </li> <li> <p>It’s supposedly the strongest muscle. How do they know this? I have no idea. Whether it is or is not doesn’t matter so much as the fact that it is almost always moving. That makes it hard for the cut to really settled down, kick back, and recover.</p> </li> <li> <p>It’s necessary for eating. We can’t just bypass the tongue by sticking a feeding tube through our nose or veins, can we? Okay I guess that we could. But we won’t because that is just unreasonable.</p> </li> <li> <p>How do people that bite their tongue in their sleep deal with this?!</p> </li> </ul> <p>So you understand that a cut in the mouth must be annoying. But you know that there are a lot of other annoying things out there such as:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Cold sores. Especially if they’re big. Especially if they’re in the crack between your lip and your gum. Especially if you’re at a celebration banquet with lots of good food but which when put inside your mouth actually gets stuck in the cold sore and pokes it, aggravating it even more until you’re at the point of torture. Yeah that’s never happened to me.</p> </li> <li> <p>Paper cuts. A million of these would be absolutely unbearable torture. One of them is pretty bad, too.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pinched nerves/muscle knots. Whether you slept wrong, you exercised too much, or anything else that you did, these are so annoying as to make you think about them constantly for the day or two that they last. You almost can’t do anything but complain about it (whether out loud or in your head).</p> </li> </ol> <p>So after all of this, the conclusion is that either I get annoyed very easily or there are a lot of annoying things out in the world.</p> </div> <section> <h1>Comments</h1> <div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </section> <div class="related"> <h2>Related Posts</h2> <ul class="related-posts"> <li> <h3> <a href="/change-2005-toyota-tacoma-manual-transmission-shifter-bushing/"> Change 2005 Toyota Tacoma Manual Transmission Shifter Seat And Bushing <small>Feb 8</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/obi100-cannot-receive-google-voice-calls/"> OBi100 Cannot Receive Google Voice Calls <small>Jan 27</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/mysterious-seeds-or-bugs-around-house/"> Mysterious Seeds Or Bugs Around House <small>Jan 17</small> </a> </h3> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/embed.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
