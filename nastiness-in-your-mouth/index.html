<div class="entry-content"><p>As part of Harry Potter-mania, Jelly Belly held a special promotion of Bertie Bott&#8217;s Jelly Beans.  My co-worker brought some a couple of bags of them in to work recently and we got the special privilege of getting to try them.</p>

<p>These are a special release and as such they have special flavors.  Everything from grass to pickle to black pepper and booger.  However, none of that can compare to a couple of the ones that I tried.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to think that I&#8217;m willing to try many things.  I have no desire to try everything once, mind you.  I have no desire to try things that might necessarily place my life/freedom/health in jeopardy.  But I still fancy myself a bit adventurous, and I&#8217;d like to think that I&#8217;m willing to try many things.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1391/896714327_fc561b0d3c_o.jpg" alt="bertie_botts_flavor_guide" />So I tried some especially fun flavors such as vomit and sardine.  However, by and far the worst flavor that I tried was rotten egg.  <strong>Rotten egg</strong>.  Who thinks of such things?</p>

<p>So my co-workers and I were trying different flavors in the mindset of doing them together.  Nobody likes to things alone, and just as I wrote in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/12/im-willing-if-you-are/">I&#8217;m Willing If You Are</a> doing things side by side with another peson is an effective psychological tool.  So after taking turns at trying different flavors and meeting with relative disgust, we decided to all try the rotten egg flavored jelly bean at once.  We each picked out jelly beans according to the guide, but when we tried it we all discovered that we had in fact chosen the much better lemon drop flavor.  Then I decided that I only live an earthly life once, so I still tried it even while my co-workers tried other things.  And as I slowly chewed and let the saliva transmit the flavor to my taste buds, I began to become quite disgusted.  The flavor and the stench conspired to cause me to gag.  I coughed a few times, and I must say that I really felt a couple of moments of almost wanting to puke.  It was so gross.  It&#8217;s amusing that it was in fact grosser than the vomit taste itself.</p>

<p>Other thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In any case, I&#8217;ve tried it and I don&#8217;t intend on trying it ever again.  But please, I would be more than happy to have you try it.  It&#8217;s not as if you have been there and done it.  :)</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;m really really really really really glad they did not choose to make a jelly bean that was flavored as sour milk.  I think that would have guaranteed puking from many adventurous souls.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that flavor tester for these nasty Bertie Bott&#8217;s Jelly Beans has got to be on the list of the worst jobs.  Imagine tasting vomit every single day at work.  And not just everyday, but constantly.  Oh man.</p></li>
<li><p>That morning of trying nasty tastes was filled with hilarity.  Paramount was when an unsuspecting co-worker believed another who said that a jelly bean was an innocuous fruit flavor when it was in fact vomit-flavored.</p></li>
