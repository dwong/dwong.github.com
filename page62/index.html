Let us go to health class. Ah the fight or flight response.</p> <blockquote> <p>A novel stimulus (which could include a perception of danger or an environmental stresser signal such as elevated sound levels or over-illumination), once perceived, is relayed from the sensory cortex of the brain through the thalamus to the brain stem. That route of signaling increases the rate of noradrenergic activity in the locus ceruleus, and the person becomes alert and attentive to the environment. -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_or_flight">Wikipedia article</a></p> </blockquote> <p>Does this happen in your life? Of course it does! Everyday it happens! When that person cuts you off and then stares you down because they think that you got too close to them, what happens? When a bully starts to belittle you, how do you react?</p> <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/227/490072881_41be204f32_m.jpg" alt="wasp"/> When you go to get the mail, open the door, and realize that there is a Dolichovespula arenaria right next to your hand, what happens? You flight!</p> <p><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/193/490072871_f0cbb54821_m.jpg" alt="Daddylonglegspider"/> When you wake up in the morning, realize that there was a spider in your dream, proceed to wake up and get ready for the day, calmly do your morning stretches as you read a magazine, and a Pholcus phalangioides walks right in front of you while you’re sitting on the ground, what happens? You fight!</p> <p>Yes, I lived it. Yes, you might also. The lesson to be learned is that sometimes you fight and sometimes you flight. It’s not always good to have a headstrong attitude in whatever you do. And it definitely doesn’t pay off to always be a sissy. It depends on the situation.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/staying-relevant-with-sphere/"> Staying Relevant With Sphere </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 7</span> <p>When one is surfing the Internet, one does enjoy a way by which to navigate the wild wild Internet. One might see content that is intriguing. One would then want to peruse more of said content. Well one is in luck!</p> <p><a href="http://www.sphere.com">Sphere.com</a> is a site whose goal is connecting people to related content. From their site:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sphere is a startup from a handful of people passionate about connecting mainstream and conversational media content</p> </blockquote> <p>Anyways, a little while ago I added a cool <a href="http://www.sphere.com/tools#wpwidget">Sphere widget</a> to the bottom of each post. Click on it (it won’t redirect you away from the page unless you click again) and you’ll see some (hopefully) related content. And then this site will be just another stone in your stepping. Anyways, hope that this is useful to you!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/adage/"> Adage </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 7</span> <p>[<strong>ad</strong>-ij]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>Proverb, saying learned by experience</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>At work when the boss wasn’t in, we were all a little less productive.

It’s just another way to say “proverb.” Of course that is good because if you’re using this word then you probably know some proverb. And that would mean that you’re wise.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/career-ramblings-for-all/"> Career Ramblings For All </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 5</span> <p>I happened on a site for <a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/">Career Development</a> a little while back (I believe from the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> homepage). It caught my eye because they had an article on helping with your resume. Now granted I already have a job, but I still remember what a pain it was to be searching for a job. At the time, I didn’t have time to read the article on doing a resume makeover, but I bookmarked the page to read at a later time. Boy am I glad that I did.</p> <p>This site is run be a couple of people who have experience in corporate America. They give both their thoughts as well as their advice on topics that might be of use to those of us who are also working in some way. This ranges anywhere from the entrepreneurs to the low man on the totem pole. They have tips on resume writing, on interviewing, as well as a myriad of other topics. All of the posts are well thought out and fairly to the point (often consisting of lists). It’s especially useful reading for those looking for a job. Although the site as a whole reaches out to all of those of us who are working, individual posts aren’t always applicable. But I suppose that wide spectrum of people in the audience dictates that as necessary.</p> <p>Anyways, days after initially bookmarking the page I added the site to my RSS reader. And as they say, I haven’t looked back since.</p> <p>A few of my favorite posts thus far:</p> <ol> <li> <p><a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/03/simple-steps-on-how-to-write-a-resume/">Simple Resume Tips</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/24/6-resume-tips-for-seasoned-professionals/">Resume Tips For Seasoned Professionals</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/11/ways-to-save-one-dollar-a-week/">Money Saving Tips</a></p> </li> </ol> <p>They’re having <a href="http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/05/03/review-career-ramblings-for-a-backlink/">a promotion where you link</a> to their site as well as write a review. This essentially raises your online profile by providing their readers with a link to your site, and it also raises their ranking in search engines that use backlinks as a method by which to calculate “importance.” This is fairly beneficial for both parties involved. And even though they might have gotten the idea from a certain site about how to make money online by blogging ( ;-) ), I still think it’s a useful endeavor because this site is useful for nearly everyone out there!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/you-get-to-see-some-statistics/"> You Get To See Some Statistics </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 4</span> <p>So just to let you know, I made a statistics page available for readers to peruse. It lists general information such as how many posts and how many comments. The most interesting statistic (in my opinion) is the list of the commentors and how many comments they have left. However, I must admit that the commenting seems to be fairly unevenly weighted. Does that make you want to do anything on my posts? ;-)</p> <p>In any case, check out the “Statistics” page in the navbar.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page63">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page61">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
