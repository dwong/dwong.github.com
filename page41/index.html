You will apply your own thoughts and feelings and create a new context. And yet this is also a fun way to test out certain aspects of yourself.</p> <p>Judging by what you think of the following, you can find out what kind of a person you are. So see what you’re made of!</p> <h5 id="list-of-ambiguous-terms">List of ambiguous terms</h5> <ol> <li> <p>DB</p> </li> <li> <p>Apache</p> </li> <li> <p>Coupling</p> </li> <li> <p>CA</p> </li> <li> <p>Perl</p> </li> <li> <p>Python</p> </li> </ol> <p>And so think about this list and what you’ve thought about for each. Here are some of the possibilities that I’ve come to think of for each of them:</p> <h5 id="possible-definitions-for-ambiguous-terms">Possible definitions for ambiguous terms</h5> <ol> <li> <h6 id="diamond-bar-ca">Diamond Bar, CA</h6> </li> </ol> <p>The city is a possible definition that would indicate that you’re aware of this Los Angeles County city.</p> <h6 id="database">Database</h6> <p>This is what I think of usually since I’ve become more and more knowledgeable about them.</p> <h6 id="decibel">Decibel</h6> <p>Well usually it’s actually dB, but who’s checking?</p> <ol> <li> <h6 id="american-indians">American Indians</h6> </li> </ol> <p>This is likely one of the more popular thoughts. It was the first result on Wikipedia anyways!</p> <p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2142/2021230227_8506d4aac2_o.jpg" alt="apache"/><em>Courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/davepearson/">DavePearson</a>.</em></p> <h6 id="attack-helicopter">Attack Helicopter</h6> <p>Used during the latter part of the 1900’s and even currently, it is a pretty well-known and well-loved machine used on the front lines.</p> <h6 id="http-server">HTTP Server</h6> <p>That means it is the software used to serve you web pages.

It has the distinct pleasure of allowing the programmer the write the most disgustingly hard to read code ever because its philosophy of allowing the programmer many ways to do the exact same thing. Super.</p> <ol> <li><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2263/2021230425_7b5838d1d2_o.jpg" alt="python"/><em>Courtesy of Flickr user <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ricmcarthur/">ricmcarthur</a></em>.</li> </ol> <h6 id="a-snake">A snake!</h6> <p>Generally not dangerous to humans, they are intimidating for their large size. They kill their prey by constricting them and thus are extremely strong.</p> <h6 id="another-programming-language">Another programming language</h6> <p>Focusing on readability, it’s rather a joy to work in compared to other languages. This high-level programming language sits over C/C++ and allows for all types of extensibility. It also sits in contrast to Perl because it strives to only have a single method, and preferably only that single method of doing something. It is easy to learn and easy to read although it allows great functionality if you so desire. Can you tell that I like it?</p> <h5 id="conclusion-about-me">Conclusion About Me</h5> <p>So what do all of these things have in common? I’m sure that if you’ve read them all (which, thank you very much for doing so!) you’ll notice that there is a disambiguation that tends towards the nerd in me. That’s right, they can all be nerdy. Haha I wonder if anyone else out there thought of the nerdy options for those phrases.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/watching-a-whole-crowd/"> Watching A Whole Crowd </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Nov 9</span> <p>So I just finished traveling for work. It was quite an interesting experience. First of all, I’ve not traveled for work before. Secondly, it was supremely interesting getting to watch this whole slew of people that I would not normally get to watch.</p> <p>People watching was probably one of the more interesting things that I got to do.</p> <h5 id="why-do-we-like-to-watch-people">Why do we like to watch people?</h5> <p>I’m of the mind that we (well at least I) like to watch people because we are interested in the human experience. Well that and because very often it’s pretty amusing. Or perhaps at the very heart of the matter, we like to see how we stack up against everyone else that’s around. Sometimes they’re stranger, sometimes they’re scarier, and sometimes they’re just like us. Alright they’re never just like us. We wouldn’t ever want to admit as much anyways.</p> <p>People are interesting. Even the boring ones. Because the boring ones are very interesting when they don’t know that they’re being watched.</p> <h5 id="benefits-of-people-watching">Benefits of people watching</h5> <ol> <li> <h6 id="laughter">Laughter</h6> </li> </ol> <p>You gotta hand it to people, they’ll do some ridiculously hilarious things when they’re unaware that they’re being watched</p> <ol> <li> <h6 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h6> </li> </ol> <p>Just because you forgot your electronic device or book, you’ll still have something to do. Almost no matter where are (unless you live as a hermit in which case this post is not for you).</p> <ol> <li> <h6 id="learn">Learn</h6> </li> </ol> <p>Other people have had different experiences in their lives. Perhaps watching them will teach you lessons about how you can be a better person.</p> <ol> <li> <h6 id="smile">Smile</h6> </li> </ol> <p>Catch those “cute” moments that nobody was supposed to see. You know, that darling thing that a child did or that self-sacrificing act that someone does for another. It’ll brighten your day and maybe next time you’ll be the one who puts a smile on somebody else’s slightly-creepy-people-watching face. :)</p> <ol> <li> <h6 id="help">Help</h6> </li> </ol> <p>If you’re not aware or watching, someone could need your help and you would have never known. If you’re people watching, you’re (by definition) aware of your surroundings. So that makes it easier if you see someone getting hurt or in need of your assistence because you’ll see the need and lend a hand, won’t you? Let’s hope so!</p> <p>People watching is a great thing to do. And it’s even more fun to do when you are surrounded by people that you would not normally be around (as I was this past weekend for my work conference). I didn’t know the vast majority of them, but I still enjoyed getting to watch them. I got to see how they interacted, I got to laugh at humorous things that I saw, and I got to amuse myself even (hopefully nobody really noticed me doing so).</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/tracking-your-own-comments/"> Tracking Your Own Comments </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Nov 4</span> <p>Commenting is a fun part of going around to different blogs. One thing that I’ve found is that it’s easy to respond to comments left on my own blog because I have a central place to access them from (namely my WordPress administration panel). It allows me to easily have conversations with people that stop by and leave comments.</p> <h5 id="leaving-comments-on-other-blogs">Leaving Comments On Other Blogs</h5> <p>However I’ve found that it’s not quite as to do with comments that I’ve left on other blogs. The reason for that is because I don’t have that central place to access to see all of my comments! I’m not very well going to remember the URL of every post that I leave a comment on. That would frankly be ridiculous.</p> <p>I’ve found a key to this problem. I’m sure that there are others out there, but I think that this one works decently enough. Check out <a href="http://co.mments.com">co.mments.com</a> if you want to see what I mean. In fact, you can even let other people see what you’re commenting on so that they can check it out and see if they’re interested in the same posts! Here is <a href="http://co.mments.com/people/goingthewongway">my public co.mments.com page</a>.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/extra-extra-check-out-the-new-theme/"> Extra! Extra! Check Out The New Theme! </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Nov 1</span> <p>So after more time than I’d like to admit, I’ve finally finished enough of my theme to put it on goingthewongway! I’m excited that I’ve changed it. Check it out and let me know what you think!</p> <p>And now I present to you: Soi-disant</p> <p>I’ve only changed my theme once to (Not So) Fresh as I posted in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/02/09/new-look/">New Look</a>. That was 8 months ago and since then quite a bit has changed.</p> <h5 id="why-i-wanted-to-make-my-own-theme">Why I wanted to make my own theme</h5> <ol> <li></li> </ol> <h6 id="have-a-unique-look-to-my-blog">Have a unique look to my blog</h6> <p>I’ve come across other blogs that had the same theme, and that wasn’t too exciting for me. I want and like to be my own. So even though the last one did look nice, it was unfortunate because other people thought that it looked nice as well.</p> <ol> <li></li> </ol> <h6 id="learn-much-much-more-web-design">Learn much, much more web design</h6> <p>CSS in particular, HTML and PHP to a lesser degree since I already knew a fair amount before doing the theme. Part of who I am wants to understand how things work and why. So learning new things can be very exciting to me. Not to mention the fact that it’s very pertinent to my profession of computer programming. (Although I must admit that I believe that I lack the creativity necessary to actually ever become a web designer. I know the nuts and bolts but lack the vision. :P)</p> <ol> <li></li> </ol> <h6 id="create-a-fluid-display">Create a fluid display</h6> <p>I wanted one that would show up well on the very popular 1024x768 and 1280x1024 screen resolutions in addition to any other screen resolutions. I’m sorry to say that it’s very likely that anything below 1024x768 won’t look all that great. A fluid display means that the text and page elements will expand according to how much space is available. My previous theme was fixed width so it didn’t look too great to me on higher resolution displays.</p> <ol> <li></li> </ol> <h6 id="speed-things-up">Speed things up</h6> <p>The last theme used a fair amount of images to create all of the nice effects. And that’s nice for people on fast connections (which at this point is a very fair amount of people). However there still are people on slower connections, and I want my blog to be accessible to them as well, too.</p> <h5 id="soi-disant">Soi-disant</h5> <p>I got the name of this theme (Soi-disant) by looking up a word of the day online. Lame, huh? I thought it was cool because it means calling oneself thus, self-styled, or so-called. Seemed interesting to me so there it is.</p> <p>So I did it all for this theme: header logo, PHP code, HTML, CSS. It was a learning experience, that is for sure.</p> <p>Wordpress theme designer: <strong>check</strong></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/new-wordpress-comment-plugins/"> New Wordpress Comment Plugins </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Oct 30</span> <p>I like commenting on blogs, and I also very much enjoy receiving comments. So I added some new plugins that I thought would facilitate that process.</p> <p>The plugins that I have added and am now using on this blog are:</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://meidell.dk/archives/2006/12/19/brians-threaded-comments-159/">Brian’s Threaded Comments</a> which allows for comments to be in threads rather than just as a single list. This is nice because it can get confusing in the way that I used to just use an “@ user” type of response. The only drawback is that I’ll probably have to limit the number of levels that nesting will occur because it will make the comments unreadable as they get more and more narrow.</li> </ol> <p>This code looks stupid and ugly on my current theme, but I’m going to change it very soon so I’m still going to post it. Most people don’t care about this, but I figured that I’d put it out there if anyone did find it useful and didn’t know too much PHP.</p> <p>So is here is the change so that there will be no “Reply to this comment” link if the comments for a post are already closed:</p> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;div class='reply'&gt;&lt;?php global $user_ID; global $post; if ( get_option("comment_registration") &amp;&amp; !$user_ID ) echo '&lt;a href="'.get_option('siteurl') . '/wp-login.php?redirect_to=' . get_permalink() . '"&gt;Log in to Reply'; elseif ('open' == $post-&gt;comment_status) {?&gt; &lt;a href='#' onclick='moveAddCommentBelow("div-comment-&lt;?php echo $c-&gt;comment_ID ?&gt;", &lt; ?php echo $c-&gt;comment_ID ?&gt;, true); return false;'&gt;Reply to this comment&lt;/a&gt; &lt; ?php } ?&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</code></p> <p>I also added code from my original comments.php in my theme file so that if a user is logged in, it will not ask them for their information (name, e-mail, etc). Although I don’t think that there are too many people with accounts on my blog (go for it, it’s not so bad) I figured that it was at least a solution that I enjoyed more for my own sake. However the code change was too much for this so I’m not going to post it in this entry. Other than that it’s pretty super! I like the look, and I hope that others will appreciate it. And most of all I hope that it fosters more discussion!</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://www.jamesmckay.net/code/comment-timeout/">Comment Timeout</a> lets me fight another problem on my blog. And that problem is spam comments. Hateful, despicable spam comments. They take at least a little bit of time to go through sometimes when people’s comments get caught in moderation. So I’ve decided that since it rather makes sense to close the comments on old posts, I will. It’s not as if people particularly post comments on my old posts anyways.</li> </ol> <p>Additionally it has the ability to keep the comments active if the post is deemed “active.” The plugin is fairly full-featured with some customizable options such as the timeout period, etc. Not a bad plugin if I do say so myself. It was a better option for me than the very basic Close Old Posts plugin written by Matt Mullenweg and listed on the wordress.org site.</p> <p>Let me know what you think of the new plugins!
