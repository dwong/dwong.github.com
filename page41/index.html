  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well after <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/09/23/unboxing-my-macbook-pro/">Unboxing My MacBook Pro</a>, I got right on getting my new computer setup the way that I wanted it.  A big part of this is downloading and installing applications that I want to use.  Macs are often purported to be ready to use out of the box.  While generally true, there are many areas where I already knew of a application that I preferred to use over the installed one (if the installed functionality even existed).  For those interested, I&rsquo;ve included a list of the programs that I installed.  Check it out and maybe you&rsquo;ll find something useful for yourself!</p>

<p>Oh and I grouped the applications into categories so adding up the number to 17 might take a little bit of mental math on your part.  Then again, you could just take my word for it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Utilities</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> - A very popular application that allows you to access a lot of things through a single interface.  It allows you to treat things as objects, which is very cool and very useful.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://virtuedesktops.info/">Virtue Desktops</a> - A virtual desktop application that has cool effects.  Unfortunately this project is no longer under development because of the impending Spaces feature of the next version of Mac OS X (Leopard).  It&rsquo;s still a good one, though.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/holtmann/eidac/software/smcfancontrol2/index.html">smcFanControl</a> - Monitor and increase the speed of your fans.  This is pretty useful to use on my MBP because even though it seems stable, it can get hot.  I raise the fan RPM for higher load situations.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://monolingual.sourceforge.net/">Monolingual</a> - On suggestions, I realized that there was unnecessary space taken up by localization files.  Found this easy-to-use program that will remove the localization files for all of your applications!  Saved a couple of GB.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.freemacsoft.net/AppCleaner/">AppCleaner</a> - When you delete things on a Mac, they give you the impression that you&rsquo;re completely done.  That there&rsquo;s no hassle of &ldquo;uninstalling&rdquo; programs like in other operating systems.  But that&rsquo;s not entirely true.  They will actually leave things behind.  Use this free application to completely remove applications when you want to get rid of them!</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Productivity</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a> - This free cross-platform suite of office programs is great!  This requires that X11 be installed as well, but in truth this is an excellent substitute for purchasing Microsoft&rsquo;s suite.  Check it out at least before purchasing MS Office for a large amount of money (compared to free).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Web</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> - The (now) ubiquitous open-source web browser is a must.  I would try Camino (and I still might), but I love the extensions on Firefox too much at this point.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a> - The Mac OS X port of the popular Gaim (now Pidgin) chat client.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://cyberduck.ch/">CyberDuck</a> - A great FTP and SFTP browser.  If you don&rsquo;t know what FTP and SFTP are, then you won&rsquo;t need this, but if you do then this is absolutely a good application to look into.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Programming</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/">Xcode Developer Tools</a> - A necessary first step if you want to develop applications for Mac OS X.  It&rsquo;s an Integrated Development Environment that I&rsquo;ve only tinkered with to make some sample apps but with which I fully intend to use in the future.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> - My favorite text editor (Emacs) lives as a fully native port to Mac OS X.  Nice.  Really, really nice.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a> - Some nice features (tabbed sessions, bookmarks) to have on top of the default Terminal.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Media</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gimp.org/macintosh/">GIMP for Mac OS X</a> - The best full-featured, open-source image modification program I know.  Needed to install X11 from the Install DVD, but that&rsquo;s no big deal.  Don&rsquo;t think that they&rsquo;re going to make a Cocoa version of this, but I just found <a href="http://developer.imendio.com/projects/gtk-macosx">GTK+ for Mac OS X</a> so that GTK+ apps (like GIMP) can run the apps without X11.  Maybe I&rsquo;ll try to see if I can help out with that project&hellip;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC Media Player</a> - This media player can handle anything and everything (okay almost) that you throw at it.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ammesset.com/irecord/">iRecord</a> - Going to (haven&rsquo;t yet) use this program to schedule and use my MBP as a Digital Video Recorder through my cable box.  What does that mean?  Hopefully being able to record HD content to my MBP!  VLC is necessary for this task as well.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> - An excellent program for recording and modifying audio.  Pretty necessary for me right now since I&rsquo;m in the process of digitizing a good-sized vinyl record collection.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://handbrake.m0k.org/">Handbrake</a> - A DVD ripper.  Never used, but have heard lots about.  Will be useful if I want to watch a DVD without taking the DVD with me.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ll probably have another post about getting interested in setting myself up with programs that will help in utilizing cross-platform applications.  Let me know if you have any others to add, and I&rsquo;ll consider using it if it suits me.  Found any of these to be useful and you hadn&rsquo;t heard of them before?  I&rsquo;d love to hear (and I&rsquo;m sure the developers of the applications would too!).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After following the MacBook Pro&rsquo;s progress from before it even came out to the first edition with its problems aplenty to the future iterations that got better and better, here is the culmination.</p>

<p>I initially started to get interested in the MBP once I realized that Mac OS X was much more than I had thought. It had pieces of BSD (a Unix foundation) and that seemed to me to be worthwhile. I wanted to see what it was like, and the MBP just became more and more attractive as I looked at it more.</p>

<p>Hopefully my waiting will pay off and my MBP will be trouble-free. Now by this time these kinds of things will not be very exciting to most people. there have been countless people who have done such posts and have tread this ground. But that is all by design because I don&rsquo;t want to be one of the first (and almost by definition get all of the problems). In any case, here are the pictures. They&rsquo;re not too interesting, but rest assured that I have some future related posts that may be more so.</p>

It looks so normal!</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1346/1425021122_9cbd7e49f5.jpg" alt="Ah packaging" />
I&rsquo;m glad that they make it as shock-resistant as possible.</p>

Goodies, goodies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nobody likes to get error messages.  But I must admit that I do like it when they&rsquo;re fun.  Better than getting a stack trace (but usually not as helpful).  They might not make up for the fact that your computer just messed up, but they&rsquo;ll let you know that the people behind the messages are real people as well.</p>

<p>This particular goodie was probably a result of outpacing the browser with the keyboard shortcuts.  Yes you better believe it, I am that fast.

<p>These are the kinds of people that live by the &ldquo;if life gives you lemons, then make lemonade&rdquo; mentality.  Good for them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are some small things that you can do that might just save your more than you&rsquo;d think.  They&rsquo;re easy to do, so give &lsquo;em a shot!  It&rsquo;s not a huge list of tips, but these are simply ones that I&rsquo;ve thought of/started using recently.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Navy Shower
Directions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Turn on water</p></li>
<li><p>Rinse</p></li>
<li><p>Turn off water</p></li>
<li><p>Lather and scrub</p></li>
<li><p>Turn on water</p></li>
<li><p>Rinse off</p></li>
<li><p>Turn off water</p></li>
<li><p>Enjoy the moment of the day that you will be the cleanest</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Save yourself water like the sailors had to do on ships.  You&rsquo;ll realize it&rsquo;s not bad at all.  I mean do you really need to have water being wasted while you scrub?  I doubt it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Coasting in the car - When you&rsquo;re driving around, think about the fact that only having two action options, accelerate and brake, could not be the most efficient.  There is room for some other option: do nothing and let the laws of physics propel you.  The momentum that you&rsquo;ve previously gained can be utilized.  All you need to do is be more aware of things going on around you.  If there is a red light up ahead, take your foot off of both pedals and just let your car glide along.  Positives while doing this are</p></li>
<li><p>Less stress - Coasting, as in life, will let you relax</p></li>
<li><p>Save money - Not pressing the gas pedal will obviously not use gas and that is an obvious monetary savings</p></li>
<li><p>Have fun (and stay awake) - It&rsquo;s like a game to accurately figure out when to let off the gas in order to coast such that you won&rsquo;t have to brake at all.  Great for when you&rsquo;re falling asleep, huh?</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate congestion - I should write about this sometime, but coasting at a constant speed in congestion will not only get you to your destination in the same time, but it will actually start the elimination of said congestion!  For those not totally self-centered, this can be seen as a huge positive.</p></li>
<li><p>Always turn off the light when you leave a room.  No matter how long you&rsquo;re gone, it has been verified (okay okay, by the great <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html">Mythbusters</a>) that it&rsquo;s more worthwhile to just turn off the light if you leave the room for ~20 seconds (I don&rsquo;t remember the actual number).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Pretty simple and straightforward, huh?  Let me know what you think about &lsquo;em in the comments.  Or even better, give me some other tips.</p>

<p>Edit: I totally forgot that when I was thinking of this post I actually meant to also say that these things will save you money but will also help save the environment!  Take that into account, why don&rsquo;t you?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Firefighters use some pretty powerful hoses.  I know this.  You know this.  But this video that I just saw confirms it.  Firehoses come in different sizes, and I would assume that they&rsquo;re using numerous &ldquo;Blitz line&rdquo; (2 &frac12; inch) or maybe even 3 inch hoses in order to do this.  10 of &lsquo;em work the magic.</p>
