Derek Wong's web log, with Wordpress-hosted content from 2007-2012.  

Rocking it using [Octopress.org](http://octopress.org), which is a framework on top of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) from 2012-2015.

Now going to straight Jekyll to simplify things, especially since Octopress seems somewhat abandoned.

This is hosted on GitHub because it allows me to host my static website for free, which is awesome!
