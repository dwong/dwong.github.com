Why? Well it is inconvenient and a burden on us to do something that we don’t really like to do. Pretty much the main reason that we do it is so that we don’t get something like a fine or a contempt of court notice.</p> <p>In any case, yesterday I served my jury duty. This is not the first time that I have had it, and I am pretty sure that it won’t be the last time. But I think that this time made me think more deeply about this thing that we call our civic duty.</p> <p>For those that don’t know (and I’m not exactly sure how you wouldn’t know), jury duty in America is when you are given a summons to appear at a courthouse at a specified time and asked to possibly serve as a juror in a trial. So basically you go to a room and wait for them to call you.</p> <p>See the thing is that there are lots (actually a majority) of people that have a strong distaste for jury duty. I must admit that I don’t care for it all too much either. It takes you away from things that you’d rather be doing, and it is possibly inconvenient when it comes to compensation and traveling. But if you think about it, we are all being short-sighted and foolish.</p> <p>The reason that jury duty is not as bad as it seems is that it ensures us a very important right that we have by living in America. It ensures us a trial by our peers if we are ever in such a situation as would deserve a trial. And that is a great thing. I, for one, am very opposed to the idea of getting judged by a bunch of lawyer-like nit-picking professional jurors. Instead I could be judged by people who, although not exactly like me, seem like they would represent a slice of society that would in some way give me a fair and objective judgment. It is a very important part of the foundation of being the United States of America! People (very many people in fact) have died for the cause of letting us have the rights that we have. And yet we, in our selfish self-centered ways, cannot find it within ourselves to give up a day (or possibly a couple of weeks) to uphold this. Amazing, isn’t it?</p> <p>I guess when you put it that way, the whole idea of serving jury duty doesn’t seem so horrible after all. Of course, I also didn’t actually get called to a jury or else I might be singing a different tune. Ah well maybe life’s more profound observations come from the sidelines. Nevertheless, think about jury duty (as well as all of the other things that happen in your life), and the ramifications that it has for your world before you immediately complain about them. So the more logical, reasonable, and sane part of me says that maybe jury duty isn’t so bad after all. But that might just last for the next 12 months until my emotional side once again takes control when I see that notice in the mail.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/lovely-civic-duty/"> Lovely Civic Duty </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 24</span> <p>So I was on call for the hardly enviable jury duty this week. And of course I get called to come in. So bright and early at 7:30 AM (at which time this entry will be published) I will be in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange, Central Justice Center. Oh just lovely.</p> <p>Likely when put into such a fun situation, amusing things happen. In any case some responsibility (and an aversion to civic punishment) dictates that I attend.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/nicknames-are-fun/"> Nicknames Are Fun </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 23</span> <p>I like nicknames. I like giving them to all types of people. I’ve found that it helps to break many initial layers of ice that might exist when you’re first getting to know people. The real key, in my opinion, to nicknames is that they create a bond between the person with the nickname and others.</p> <p>I guess that there are also different types of nicknames. I don’t mean derogatory, kind, or funny. I mean there are nicknames that everyone calls someone by and then there are nicknames that only exist between the nickname giver and the nickname recipient. I like the latter.</p> <p>Instead of discussing all of the nicknames that I’ve given, though, I’d like to now list all of the ones that I’ve received. The interesting list includes:</p> <ul> <li><strong>JQ</strong> - <em>It stands for Johnny Quest. I don’t even know why I got it.</em>__</li> <li><strong>T-man</strong> - <em>This is actually a funny story. So in college I met a couple of girls at an event. And then I met them again. And again. And finally one time when they asked me what my name was, I got tired of it so I just told them it was Mr. T. As in the A-team guy with the gold chains. Haha and they thought to call me T-man. After that, they sure remembered who I was!</em></li> <li><strong>Deek</strong> - <em>I don’t even know why the girl who gave me this one did. I think it’s pretty strange. Just like the nickname giver. :P</em></li> <li><strong>Darkwing</strong> - <em>Okay this is a strange one because it’s half given by myself. In the cartoon Darkwing Duck, the theme song has a line “when you’re in trouble you call DW.” So I think that someone called me Darkwing Duck when I was a little kid because of the song. And then I made up an AIM screen name using it. And then someone started using it (but only on rare occasions).</em></li> <li><strong>Dirk</strong> - <em>I suppose that this one makes sense because of how similar it sounds to my name. If only I played like Mr. Nowitzki. Well not so much in the playoffs this year. But all of the rest of the time that’d be awesome.</em></li> <li><strong>reDERKulous</strong> - <em>I think that this is an awesome nickname. I got this nickname when someone was making them up to input as our bowler names. I appreciate the creativity, and I’ve used this as a screen name in video games (namely Halo 1 and 2). Of course, since I made the name I had to live up to it and truly be reDERKulous. :)</em></li> <li><strong>DT</strong> - <em>This is an obvious one since my middle initial is T. The one who gave me this one doesn’t use it too often, though.</em></li> <li><strong>Drek</strong> - <em>Another obvious one, but it shows how the giver is very unique and unlike others. Plus it just sounds amusing in her voice, like a little kid who can’t entirely say a word.</em></li> <li><strong>Derek Wong-a-long</strong> - <em>I got this in high school. Haha I have no idea why. It doesn’t mean anything (meaningful or perverted).</em></li> <li><strong>Ricardo</strong> - <em>HA this one is so random. I actually don’t even remember HOW the person who gave this one to me got it.</em></li> <li><strong>junny</strong> - <em>I only got this one because I made one up for this person that had to do with their Korean name. It’s an amusing one, though because it is seemingly a name for a 13 year old.</em></li> <li><strong>derekson</strong> - <em>I think that the person who gave me this name just likes to append different endings to people real names to come up with a nickname.</em></li> <li><strong>muga</strong> - <em>This one was definitely in response to me giving someone the nickname “muha”. Nonetheless it’s an amusing one.</em></li> <li><strong>d-d-d-d-derek</strong> - <em>I don’t even know how she came up with this. But she did.</em></li> </ul> <p>Okay that is all just a sample of the different nicknames that I’ve received. There are definitely others (some of which I have likely forgotten forever). There are others that I’m not eager to share and have thus kept them to myself. And then there is one of my very favorite: <strong>derekudarkwingduckingofthejungle</strong>. Well it wins for longest, that is for sure. And it is one of the most original. My very amusing friend <a href="http://www.xanga.com/totml715">Melissa Tong</a> is the very originator of this nickname. Haha how awesome is that?</p> <p>Coincidentally, she would also appreciate a post about her. ;-) I hardly ever write about actual people that I know, instead prefering to focus on ideas and topics. However I will make an exception in this case (and possibly others in the future). Anyways, I realized while talking to her that something cool that she does is give people amusing nicknames! I really enjoy that her nicknames, although perhaps not stemming from an event but rather their actual name, are still original and humorous. Plus they’re usually corny. And that says a lot about the person that she is. Well seeing as how I told her that someday I’d write about her, I considered many other amusing things to talk about instead of just the fact that she gives out lots of nicknames. Some of the other considered topics and quotes are more funny, but I decided to refrain on my better judgment.</p> <p>All in all, nicknames are fun. I like giving them, and I like getting them. However I must admit that they require some real perseverance if you want them to stick. Oh and I don’t really like mean-spirited ones because they detract from the previously mentioned bond between giver and recipient.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/amusing-searches/"> Amusing Searches </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 22</span> <p>So another advantage to hosting my own blog (okay it’s not <em>just</em> limited to hosting yourself) in addition to other <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/15/cost-and-benefits-of-running-your-own-server/">costs and benefits of running your own server</a> is that you get to see statistics. You can install any type of tracking system. I personally am using <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">Statcounter</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, but there are a plethora of options out there.</p> <p>In any case I’d like to share what some amusing searches on my site have been:</p> <ol> <li> <p>**pastor “Derek Wong” **- <em>Say whaaatt? Haha</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>siafu ant</strong> - <em>One would think that I would get no hits on the Siafu Ants since there are other much more reputable sources than my blog on a species of ant. Oh well.</em></p> </li> <li> <p>**tweedle dee tweedle dumb **- <em>Apparently nobody writes about Alice in Wonderland anymore.</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>how to use gimp to make a passport photo</strong> - <em>I would guess that someone could arrive at my site on this because it’s a pretty specific topic that I wrote a post about.</em></p> </li> <li> <p>**Jennifer Shih facebook **- <em>Now that’s just strange. Quit it stalker kids. Or rather, quit it stalker boys. :P</em></p> </li> <li> <p>**amazing gross photos **- <em>I think that’s awesome that they could arrive at my site on these keywords! Of course I probably disappoint because I don’t exactly have amazingly gross photos.</em></p> </li> <li> <p>**wong way poet **- <em>That seems pretty specific to me. You’d think that they could just remember “goingthewongway” if they can already remember “wong way.” Or maybe there is just some poet out there named wong who is writing about the way. I bet he wants my domain name. :P</em></p> </li> <li> <p>**california dmv temporary-operating-permit **- <em>I’m very happy that I can provide the answer to this. I know that I would have wanted to happen upon the answer in a quick search!</em></p> </li> </ol> <p>Okay that is just a taste. And considering that some of these searches are old, I make no guarantees that you will still find me indexed for these keywords. I just wanted to share how amusing it is for me to see these things.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/budgeteeer-vs-budget/"> Budgeteer vs Budget </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 21</span> <p>Well I suppose that there aren’t too many original ideas out there. Nevertheless, when I happened upon a piece of software called <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/featured-download/allocate-your-money-in-envelopes-with-budget-262014.php">Budget</a> while I was reading through my feed reader this morning, I had to take a second look. Why? Well because I wrote (and am in current development of) <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/the-budgeteer/">The Budgeteer</a>!</p> <p>There were notable differences, obviously. Comparing the two programs, here is what I noticed:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Budget deposits absolute amounts into each sub-account (represented as envelopes) whereas the Budgeteer deposits percentages into each sub-account. I recently thought about this difference actually. It would be nice to have options to do both/either. My original approach of percentages allows for things such as taking 10% off the top for tithe, but it has pitfalls such as having to specify a percentage for each sub-account. Granted of course you can play around with them over time such that they will approach what you actually need/want/use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Budget is much prettier. Both their Windows and Mac executables look better than my Python GUI. Granted, I haven’t been trying to make it beautiful or anything. And it is essentially the same functionality (clicking on different buttons, etc). Nevertheless, that is a plus that Budget has.</p> </li> <li> <p>Obviously Budget is production software that is being sold whereas the Budgeteer is something that I wrote up in a week and have since played with only a little bit. Budget also costs 30 bucks, and (when the time comes) the Budgeteer will not.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Budgeteer has a cooler name.</p> </li> </ol> <p>All in all, I would like to think that Budget and the Budgeteer are similar. However, I must concede that they are not even close to similar. Budget is much more polished, and I am now more determined to develop the Budgeteer!</p> <p>I’ve changed the name of the program to Budgeteer. I don’t know why I need so many e’s.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page58">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page56">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
