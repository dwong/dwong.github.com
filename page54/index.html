Does anyone? Well I do. Sometimes anyways.</p> <p>I’ve been noticing things about the advertisements in magazines. Well I guess depending on the magazine that you are reading, things are different. However, with some of the magazines that I’ve recently read, the thing that I don’t understand is why advertisers would even want their advertisements placed in the back. Do people even look at them (I know that I don’t)? Is their respective business increased as a result of being placed amongst many other advertisements? I just don’t get it.</p> <p>Are they scared that if they stop advertising, that their business will decrease? It seems to me that it’s hard to justify the cost of placing such a poorly placed advertisement. Well, the poorly placed is just my opinion. Stuck in the nether pages with other random advertisements is not exactly a place that readers like to peruse carefully if you ask me.</p> <p>I think that some of the best advertisements are those that give you something simply by looking. Well I am still talking about magazine advertisements so this does not apply to other advertisements. In any case, have you read those advertisements that give you some useful information and/or organize what they’re selling so that it’s very appealing. On the one hand, I like these because they’re useful to me. On the other hand I have to take it all with a grain of salt because it <em>is</em> still an advertisement.</p> <p>In any case, I don’t think that I’m ever going to be someone who will advertise in a magazine. But then again, I guess that’s why I don’t make my living in the areas of fashion, car parts, or male enhancement gimmicks.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/penchant/"> Penchant </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 4</span> <p>[<strong>pen</strong>-ch_uh_nt]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>A strong preference, attraction to, or desire for something</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>As someone who loves the outdoors, Rob has a penchant for taking picnics with his love.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>This is has nothing to do with pens or chants.

It had a list of AIM acronyms that are not all too commonly used taken from America Online, 2007. Now most people nowadays know of things like LOL (laugh out loud), BRB (be right back), and TTYL (talk to you later). But those are maybe just the originals and can’t necessarily say exactly what you want. Or maybe they’re so overused that they’re boring. In any case, if you already knew any of the following, you have been online far too much. You need to get your pale self outside and greet the sun more often.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>ADAD</strong><em>another day, another dollar</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>DQMOT</strong><em>don’t quote me on this</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>BITD</strong><em>back in the day</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>SMFETE</strong><em>smiling from ear to ear</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>GOL</strong><em>giggling out loud</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>IMNERHO</strong><em>in my never even remotely humble opinion</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>BTDTGTTSAWIO</strong><em>been there, done that, got the t-shirt, and wore it out</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>PRW</strong><em>parents are watching</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>WYGOWM</strong><em>will you go out with me?</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>MTFBWU</strong><em>may the force be with you</em></p> </li> </ol> <p>Personally I’m a fan of WYGOWM and BTDTGTTSAWIO. Maybe you can find an occasion to use them. ADAD is amusing just because the saying is amusing. If I ever encountered acronyms like this online, I would be totally confused.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/recycling-is-good-on-many-fronts/"> Recycling Is Good On Many Fronts </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 2</span> <p>I’m not sure how many people actually recycle their goods. Aluminum cans, glass bottles, plastic bottles, and more can all be recycled. I know that this is not true everywhere, but here in California you actually have to put a cash deposit down on every single item when you pay for it. So when you recycle the item (whether it be plastic or aluminum or whatever) you are actually only getting back your deposit. Somehow I think that if everyone knew this, then there would be more recycling going on.</p> <p>In any case, I’d like to share a tip for recycling on your own. As you very well know, you don’t have to actually return cans in order to be recycling. You could also be recycling by using things for multiple purposes. A sample case would be the following tip:</p> <p>Next time you go grocery shopping (after using <a href="http://prices.goingthewongway.com/">the grocery pricer</a> to check that you’re going to buy things at a good price, of course) you should choose to ask for plastic one time and paper the next. At home, take the paper bag and place it inside of the plastic one. Unfold the paper bag so that it is now simply its original size with the plastic bag on the outside of it. Place your trash in this bag and when full throw the entire thing away. This is useful because the paper will be able to hold the majority of the weight while the plastic ensures that no leaking will happen. By using this method, you are going to save yourself some cost for “trash bags” while also recycling the bags that you’ve gotten from the grocery store!</p> <p>I don’t actually know if this is a well-known thing to do. Maybe it is, and I’m just unaware. In any case I’d like those that don’t know to be able to do this as well.</p> <p>Oh I just thought of another tip that I heard from someone. After you’re done with your toothbrush (if you still use the traditional manual one) then you can use that in your cleaning around the house! If toothbrushes are designed to get rid of the nasty plaque on your teeth, then don’t you think that they’ll be good at cleaning any kind of gunk that you can throw at it?</p> <p>Alright and coincidentally I just read about some tips for different uses for everyday household things. I like the <a href="http://www.realsimple.com/realsimple/gallery/0,21863,1030084-5,00.html">different uses for dryer sheets</a>, but you can check out the tips for all 10 items featured.</p> <p>In any case, recycling is not hard, it’s good for both the environment and society, and it’s good for you! So take the opportunity and happy recycling!</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page55">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page53">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
