It was a car with many bumper stickers. Now that in and of itself is not necessary ironic. (Unless of course you’re driving a nice car with ugly stickers on it as I commented in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/11/sell-your-porsche/">Sell Your Porsche</a>.) But there was a bumper sticker of an Israeli flag, and there was a license plate frame that was from <a href="http://www.hillcrestcs.org/">Hillcrest Christian School</a>. How does that work?</p> <p>You know, I could very well be wrong because it might not be that ironic after all. They could just be <a href="http://www.jewsforjesus.org/">Jews for Jesus</a>. And that would be quite nice. I would have liked to have met them.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/how-are-magazine-advertisements-worthwhile/"> How Are Magazine Advertisements Worthwhile? </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 5</span> <p>Do any of you read magazines anymore? Does anyone? Well I do. Sometimes anyways.</p> <p>I’ve been noticing things about the advertisements in magazines. Well I guess depending on the magazine that you are reading, things are different. However, with some of the magazines that I’ve recently read, the thing that I don’t understand is why advertisers would even want their advertisements placed in the back. Do people even look at them (I know that I don’t)? Is their respective business increased as a result of being placed amongst many other advertisements? I just don’t get it.</p> <p>Are they scared that if they stop advertising, that their business will decrease? It seems to me that it’s hard to justify the cost of placing such a poorly placed advertisement. Well, the poorly placed is just my opinion. Stuck in the nether pages with other random advertisements is not exactly a place that readers like to peruse carefully if you ask me.</p> <p>I think that some of the best advertisements are those that give you something simply by looking. Well I am still talking about magazine advertisements so this does not apply to other advertisements. In any case, have you read those advertisements that give you some useful information and/or organize what they’re selling so that it’s very appealing. On the one hand, I like these because they’re useful to me. On the other hand I have to take it all with a grain of salt because it <em>is</em> still an advertisement.</p> <p>In any case, I don’t think that I’m ever going to be someone who will advertise in a magazine. But then again, I guess that’s why I don’t make my living in the areas of fashion, car parts, or male enhancement gimmicks.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/penchant/"> Penchant </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 4</span> <p>[<strong>pen</strong>-ch_uh_nt]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>A strong preference, attraction to, or desire for something</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>As someone who loves the outdoors, Rob has a penchant for taking picnics with his love.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>This is has nothing to do with pens or chants.

It had a list of AIM acronyms that are not all too commonly used taken from America Online, 2007. Now most people nowadays know of things like LOL (laugh out loud), BRB (be right back), and TTYL (talk to you later). But those are maybe just the originals and can’t necessarily say exactly what you want. Or maybe they’re so overused that they’re boring. In any case, if you already knew any of the following, you have been online far too much. You need to get your pale self outside and greet the sun more often.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>ADAD</strong><em>another day, another dollar</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>DQMOT</strong><em>don’t quote me on this</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>BITD</strong><em>back in the day</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>SMFETE</strong><em>smiling from ear to ear</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>GOL</strong><em>giggling out loud</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>IMNERHO</strong><em>in my never even remotely humble opinion</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>BTDTGTTSAWIO</strong><em>been there, done that, got the t-shirt, and wore it out</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>PRW</strong><em>parents are watching</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>WYGOWM</strong><em>will you go out with me?</em></p> </li> <li> <p><strong>MTFBWU</strong><em>may the force be with you</em></p> </li> </ol> <p>Personally I’m a fan of WYGOWM and BTDTGTTSAWIO. Maybe you can find an occasion to use them. ADAD is amusing just because the saying is amusing. If I ever encountered acronyms like this online, I would be totally confused.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page55">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page53">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
