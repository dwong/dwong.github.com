Derek Wong's web log, with Wordpress-hosted content from 2007-2012.  

Now we're rocking it using [Octopress.org](http://octopress.org), which is a framework on top of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

This is hosted on GitHub because it allows me to host my static website for free, which is awesome!
