Have you noticed the type of people who are willing to make comments or offer up their (often critical) opinion of something without actually trying to do something about it? I have come to notice that there are quite a fair amount of these type of people around.</p> <p>In the workplace they manifest themselves as the people who can’t help you accomplish something “because it’s not what they do”. Essentially they are perfectly content to let you struggle to do something that you have are new to when they have in fact been working there for years. They are perfectly comfortable letting you sweat and possibly make mistakes. Despite all of this, they will be the first ones to come to you if there is a problem. Accusing, questioning, belittling, it’s laudable, isn’t it?</p> <p>As a friend, they will be the person that can’t for the life of them ever decide on where to go or what to eat. They will be indecisive about it all. However, they will be the first and most vocal critic when something doesn’t turn out well. Even if things didn’t turn out well, they will suddenly realize that something else would have been a better choice for <em>some</em> reason. They will talk behind your back, they will complain to your face, they will whine, and they will generally not be a whole lot of fun to be around. More of a “friend” than a friend, I’d venture to say. And maybe not even that.</p> <p>In the open source community (and in other areas as well) they are the ones that will look at a product and immediately find the flaws. Granted the flaws should be found, but they at the same time do nothing but complain about the bugs that exist. They don’t try to help out in some way, and they don’t ever stop bringing up points that are already known. They will harp on the same issue as if that were the main point, even when it is not. They are generally ungrateful and quitters who wouldn’t know how to even start to formulate the product that they feel is insufficient. They are frankly useless.</p> <p>These are just examples. There are countless other examples out there that I’ve experienced or seen, but for whom I would rather not have to rack my brain to remember.</p> <p>There are so many instances of this type of person out there that one has to wonder how in the world they can get along. How can they have any type of relationship with anyone when they have such an unbalanced approach to things? How high can they really aspire when they don’t care to do anything for themselves?</p> <p>I just don’t really understand these types of people.</p> </div> <section> <h1>Comments</h1> <div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </section> <div class="related"> <h2>Related Posts</h2> <ul class="related-posts"> <li> <h3> <a href="/monetary-gifts/"> Monetary Gifts <small>Jun 24</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/litter-bugs-and-entitlement/"> Litter Bugs And Entitlement <small>Jun 3</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/cry-room-culture/"> Cry Room Culture <small>May 5</small> </a> </h3> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/embed.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
