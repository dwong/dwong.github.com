Lately I have been reading and enjoying [Big Government](http://biggovernment.com/), which is a website created by Andrew Breitbart.  It is a website that advocates a smaller government by exposing the ways that the government is improperly doing things.  It is definitely enlightening because the articles attempt to show the readers ways that our very own federal government (of the United States of America) are doing things that most of us would very likely disapprove of.  And boy do we!  (Or at least...I do.)  Compounding the problem is that many of these things do not even seem legal in light of the [10th amendment](http://www.goingthewongway.com/512/10th-amendment/)!

This isn't a long post and really I am not adding anything to the collective knowledge or opinion of the Internet.  However I have been enjoying some of the videos that I have seen there and would therefore like to share:
