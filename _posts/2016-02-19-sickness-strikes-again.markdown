I have now been taken out by the Bear and her sicknesses twice within a span of 3 weeks.  Considering I always thought of myself as a healthy and robust person, it's no joke when they say that you should avoid having kids if you don't want to get sick!  It just goes to show you that none of us are really that strong.  We're really rather feeble and weak (despite our best intentions).
