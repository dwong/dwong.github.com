Have you checked out [Google Web History](http://www.google.com/history/) lately?  It's pretty scary stuff.  It's a log of what you have searched for on Google.  I know that Google's slogan is "don't be evil," but it is not comforting to be able to look at your past searches for weeks.  

Personally I went in, cleared it and then put it on "pause."  I don't really want anyone to be tracking what I'm searching for and building a profile on me.  It just seems so invasive.  And I don't like it.
