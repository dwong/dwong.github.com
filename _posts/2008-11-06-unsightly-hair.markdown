We've all seen people that have more hair than others.  There are some that also have hair where others might not have it.

Unfortunately, these follicles are not really something that we get to choose.  Whether we like it or not, we have genes that entirely dictate such things as the color of our hair, our height, and where hair grows on our body.  We can try to change these things through dye, clothing, and hair removal (or implantation).  But in reality we are who we are made to be.

It's sad that we judge people based on things that they cannot change.  (This is in no way a political statement about homosexuality, even though it's becoming apparent to me that it can be interpreted as such.  Or maybe it's just been on the mind with Proposition 8 in California.  Anyways, see [this](http://www.narth.com/docs/istheregene.html) for some truth about the "gay gene" research done by Dr. Dean Hamer.  But I digress.)

So people can't control things like where their hair grows.  How do we in society get so disgusted by it?  I admit that I can/do as well.  But it's strange how we can make demeaning statements about  things that are not determined by these people at all!

Sometimes society stinks.  And for sure mobs of people are no good.
