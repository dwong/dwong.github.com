Crom is a man who works early.<br/>
He definitely does not have hair that's curly.<br/>
He likes to have [interesting](/crom-the-one-who-loveshates-his-girlfriend/) chats.<br/>
I highly doubt he works out the lats.<br/>

He is quite a unique one, that Crom is.<br/>
Of that I am telling the truth, I promise.<br/>
He walks about with a full bowl of food,<br/>
And [does things](/crom-the-one-who-cuts-his-toenails-at-work/) that some might think of as rude.<br/>

He tells bad jokes<br/>
To most any of the folks.<br/>
Worst of all when it's about work and he's on the phone<br/>
He tells me and my friends to lower our tone.<br/>

It's very strange since there are rooms.<br/>
I mean, you can't make noise like you can in the [restrooms](/crom-the-loud-one/).<br/>
At the least he can watch out to not be so loud,<br/>
But that lack of self-examination is what sets him apart from the crowd.<br/>
