So I was on call for the hardly enviable jury duty this week.  And of course I get called to come in.  So bright and early at 7:30 AM (at which time this entry will be published) I will be in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange, Central Justice Center.  Oh just lovely.

Likely when put into such a fun situation, amusing things happen.  In any case some responsibility (and an aversion to civic punishment) dictates that I attend.
