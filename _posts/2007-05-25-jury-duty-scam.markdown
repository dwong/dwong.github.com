So in addition to [my thoughts on jury duty](http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/25/jury-duty-is-good/), I wanted to inform anyone out there of a scam that I heard about at jury duty.

It involves getting told that there is a fine for missing jury duty.  The scammers will call and ask for you social security number to verify who you are as well as your credit card number in order to process your fine.  Now a word to the wise: be very careful whenever you are asked for either of these pieces of information **no matter what the situation is**.  That is a reasonable thing to remember whenever you are confronted with things like this.

So obviously after that you get taken for much more than your supposed fine.  You get taken for your identity.  And that is just no good.
