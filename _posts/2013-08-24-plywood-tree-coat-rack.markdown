Here is a fun and very functional little add on that I recently did:

![Full Plywood Tree](https://img.gtww.net/2013/08_Tree_Hooks/1397/tree-1_0df0f71.jpg)
![Hook Closeup](https://img.gtww.net/2013/08_Tree_Hooks/1397/tree-2_6688327.jpg)

On top of all of that, it was super cheap to do (especially compared with just buying a premade set of hooks).  The cost breakdown was something like:

* Dowels - $5
* Dowel Screws - $2.50
* Plywood scraps - already had
* Screw, nails - already had

As you can see I mainly used scraps that I already had from other projects.  If you had to buy it, it could still be pretty affordable in comparison to buying a hook rack.  Plus you could customize the tree to your heart's desire.
