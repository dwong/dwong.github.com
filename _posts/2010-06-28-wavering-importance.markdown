If it's true that the importance that things have wavers according to what else is happening then I guess it just goes to show that this blog didn't have a really high place in my heart.  While I have been making sure that it's still running and checking on it every now and then, I have not written a new post in quite awhile.  But now that I am sitting here in my very own house with this ring on my finger I guess that the blog is rising back up.

I sure am glad because I have not had a public place to air my thoughts.  And that means that either I have been keeping it in or even worse I have not been having any interesting thoughts.  I enjoy writing posts that act as a running commentary on interesting thoughts that I have rather than those of a personal nature, but I figured that I needed to break back into this whole blog thing with something easy.  And what is easier than spilling about what has already happened to you?

So that was my way of saying sorry for not writing, but I was busy buying a house and getting married!  But I'm back!
