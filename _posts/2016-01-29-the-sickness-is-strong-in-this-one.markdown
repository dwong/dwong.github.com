The Bear got sick this past week.  It was bound to happen eventually, right?  The illness came with a few bouts of vomit along with some rather unpleasant less-than-sleepful nights.  All is as expected.  Except that I was also infected with said illness!

So I'm not saying that I don't ever get sick.  Because I do.  I definitely do.  In fact when I do get sick it seems like it's extra awful.  But it still catches me by surprise that I can get sick so easily by such a little baby.  Conceptually I know that germs are much tinier than either of us, and size does not matter at all when getting sick.  But something about it still surprises me.  

Thankfully it only took me out for a day.  But boy was it an unpleasant day!
