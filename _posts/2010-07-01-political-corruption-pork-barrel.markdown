Pork is delicious when it means the consumed meat from a pig.  Conversely it is awful when it refers to the appropriations of government money for local projects.  While I might be a big supporter of the former, let's not forget that the late Senator Robert Byrd was a huge proponent of the latter.  

When he passed, I heard a radio commentator quote an unnamed source from West Virginia saying that they would not know what to do now that he wasn't in Washington to send federal funds back to them.  It makes sense for them to think this way because he sent back billions to them during his tenure (Citizens Against Government Waste has a [tally of Senator Byrd's pork](http://www.cagw.org/newsroom/byrd-pork-tally.html) that will boggle the mind).  So it is true, they just lost a major source of income.  What's a person to do?!  I have an idea: start making your own way instead of swiping money from the rest of the country.

I am sure that the people of West Virginia are not the only ones.  There are recipients of pork everywhere, and they should all be ashamed.  This corruption needs to stop.  We all know that politicians are self-serving, power-hungry individuals.  Do not feed them your vote **or** willingly eat their pork!  Does anyone think about the fact that the politicians are taking money from everyone else just so that they can remain in office?  It seems like pork barrel politics could also be called much much worse.
