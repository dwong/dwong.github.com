[im-**bayb**]


#### Definition:


To drink



#### Example of usage:


After coming in from playing in the heat, the boy imbibed a large amount of refreshing iced tea.



#### Comments:


Spice up how you say drink with this word.  It's pretty easy to incorporate wherever you would normally say "drink."  And actually I think that "imbibed" sounds better thank "drank."
