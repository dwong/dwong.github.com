Recently my dad asked me if I could identify some small things that were appearing in his house.  He was finding them sporadically in his house.  A few here, a few there.  Some in the bed, some on his desk, one or two on the couch.  I had no idea what they were, but my wife found a forum where someone had the exact same problem.

Turns out that they were whole flax seeds that had fallen out of a heating pad (something like [this](http://amzn.to/2jN5UDO)).  They resemble small apple seeds or something more nefarious from a bug or animal (as we initially imagined).  Thankfully it was nothing more than a hole in the heating bag!
