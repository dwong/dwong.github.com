I happened on a site for [Career Development](http://www.careerramblings.com/) a little while back (I believe from the [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com/) homepage).  It caught my eye because they had an article on helping with your resume.  Now granted I already have a job, but I still remember what a pain it was to be searching for a job.  At the time, I didn't have time to read the article on doing a resume makeover, but I bookmarked the page to read at a later time.  Boy am I glad that I did.

This site is run be a couple of people who have experience in corporate America.  They give both their thoughts as well as their advice on topics that might be of use to those of us who are also working in some way.  This ranges anywhere from the entrepreneurs to the low man on the totem pole.  They have tips on resume writing, on interviewing, as well as a myriad of other topics.  All of the posts are well thought out and fairly to the point (often consisting of lists).  It's especially useful reading for those looking for a job.  Although the site as a whole reaches out to all of those of us who are working, individual posts aren't always applicable.  But I suppose that wide spectrum of people in the audience dictates that as necessary.

Anyways, days after initially bookmarking the page I added the site to my RSS reader.  And as they say, I haven't looked back since.

A few of my favorite posts thus far:




  1. [Simple Resume Tips](http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/03/simple-steps-on-how-to-write-a-resume/)


  2. [Resume Tips For Seasoned Professionals](http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/24/6-resume-tips-for-seasoned-professionals/)


  3. [Money Saving Tips](http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/04/11/ways-to-save-one-dollar-a-week/)



They're having [a promotion where you link](http://www.careerramblings.com/2007/05/03/review-career-ramblings-for-a-backlink/) to their site as well as write a review.  This essentially raises your online profile by providing their readers with a link to your site, and it also raises their ranking in search engines that use backlinks as a method by which to calculate "importance."  This is fairly beneficial for both parties involved.  And even though they might have gotten the idea from a certain site about how to make money online by blogging ( ;-) ), I still think it's a useful endeavor because this site is useful for nearly everyone out there!
