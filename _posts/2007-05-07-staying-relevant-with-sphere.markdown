When one is surfing the Internet, one does enjoy a way by which to navigate the wild wild Internet.  One might see content that is intriguing.  One would then want to peruse more of said content.  Well one is in luck! 
 

[Sphere.com](http://www.sphere.com) is a site whose goal is connecting people to related content.  From their site:


> Sphere is a startup from a handful of people passionate about connecting mainstream and conversational media content



Anyways, a little while ago I added a cool [Sphere widget](http://www.sphere.com/tools#wpwidget) to the bottom of each post.  Click on it (it won't redirect you away from the page unless you click again) and you'll see some (hopefully) related content.  And then this site will be just another stone in your stepping.  Anyways, hope that this is useful to you!
