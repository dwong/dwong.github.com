I have long since canceled my home phone service, but I have an OBi100 (succeeded by the [OBi200](http://amzn.to/2kDUgyE)) paired with [Google Voice](https://www.google.com/voice) for free VoIP (no emergency calls, though).

Unfortunately recently I was only able to call out but not receive calls.  I tried doing everything listed on [the OBiTalk forum instructions](http://www.obitalk.com/forum/index.php?topic=8560.msg56460#msg56460) to no avail.  Then I found [a post about the similar OBi110](http://www.obitalk.com/forum/index.php?topic=2831.0).  So the answer for me was the same: delete the configuration and set it up again from the beginning!  Hope this helps someone!
