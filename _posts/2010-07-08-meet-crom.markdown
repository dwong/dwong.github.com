I have a co-worker who I will call Crom (thankfully not his real name).  He is a balding, single, middle-aged computer programmer.  There are numerous things about him that I do not understand.  Some of them are very amusing and some of them are difficult to understand.

I have decided that my own thoughts (while arguably interesting and intriguing) are not the only thing that I want on this blog.  I want to season the meat and potatoes of this blog's content with some posts about my everyday life.  You will be able to judge the amusement factor of these posts for yourself.

Anyway, back to Crom.  He sits in a nearby cubicle and has been working in this office for over a decade.  That makes his tenure longer than the newer people (like myself) but definitely not as long as the old timers (of which there are a whole lot, some of whom have been around for a couple of decades!).  He works rather autonomously on single-main projects.  I suspect that he and I do not share the same sense of humor.  We also do not share the same idea of manners but more on that later.  For now, just take note of this man as he will very likely come up again.
