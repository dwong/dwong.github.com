The Bear is starting to push herself backwards.  Some might call it crawling, but others might laugh in their faces because it doesn't look like crawling.  She is also making it difficult to get our weekly picture.  This means putting the props in her mouth, but more often it means knocking over blocks.  Bothersome?  Yes!  Amusing?  Yes, indeed!
