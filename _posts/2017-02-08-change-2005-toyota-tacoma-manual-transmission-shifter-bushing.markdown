It's probably rare to have a manual transmission in this day and age, but I enjoy it.  Its scarcity probably also means that I wasn't able to find too much help online with a recent issue where my 2005 Toyota Tacoma was popping out of gear.  This would cause the RPMs to spike dramatically since I would unexpectedly be in neutral.  I eventually realized that I needed to change the shifter seat and bushing.

1. Seat and bushing, respectively.  I purchased mine at a local Toyota dealer for around $25 for both parts, but I found [one on Amazon](http://amzn.to/2kpad8j) that seems like it would work as well.

2. Before any changes

4. Removed cup holder console, watch out for the plastic clips because they break easily

10. Remove screws around shifter

![Step 10a](//img.gtww.net/2016/09_Tacoma_shifter/dfao/shifter-10-1-f1d970b.jpg)
11. Remove shifter boot

12. Remove bolts
![Step 12](//img.gtww.net/2016/09_Tacoma_shifter/dfao/shifter-13-1-eead7f1.jpg)
13. Remove shifter assembly
![Step 13](//img.gtww.net/2016/09_Tacoma_shifter/dfao/shifter-14-1-0955d5a.jpg)
![Step 14](//img.gtww.net/2016/09_Tacoma_shifter/dfao/shifter-15-1-64e1642.jpg)
14. Remove shifter from assembly.  This was by far the hardest part.  Part of it is the fact that you don't know what's going on in the assembly and the other is that everything is really stuck together.  I ended up being able to do it with pliers and 2 screw drivers.  But after it was done I was able to do it with just pliers.  It's spring loaded so you just need to push down on the retainer cap and twist until it pops out.

15. Compare the seats.  The old one was crumbly and destroyed!
![Step 16](//img.gtww.net/2016/09_Tacoma_shifter/dfao/shifter-17-1-a49412e.jpg)
16. Compare the bushings.  Not too bad but might as well change them.
