The problem with this code is there are too many break statements!
```python
def sleep(person, baby):
	start_time = getTime()
	while person.isAsleep():
		time = getTime()
		if start_time.add(MINUTES, 180) >= time:
			break
		else if baby.isCrying()
			break
def __main__():
	while derek.isAlive():
		if not areThingsToDo():
			sleep(derek, derek.getChild());	
		
```
