We use names in order to identify people.  Names are different according to our culture.  Sometimes the family name is given more weight.  Other cultures will have names that have a much stronger tie to what the person is like (e.g., Dashing Wind).  And I am sure that there are many other uses for names that I don't know about.

Here in America people often have middle names.  We especially like to use the middle initial in order to make our name more unique.  But our middle name is usually kept to ourselves.  Or perhaps it's just left to those times when our parents are exceptionally angry with us.  There's nothing like having your full name yelled to let you know that it's time to do something right.

In any case I have found myself over the years enjoying learning what people's middle names are.  After thinking about why this might be so, I have realized that it's probably because it usually _is_ secret.  I like knowing secrets.  Doesn't everyone?  Middle names in particular make me feel that I am getting the chance to know people better because I have discovered something that so many other people don't even take the time to find out.  It creates an instant connection with them.

To top it all off, middle names can often be unique.  And that can lead to amusing situations, indeed.

Middle names win.  Sharing is caring.  Ugh that's so cliche, huh?
