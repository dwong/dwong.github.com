So I think that one interesting effect of the Internet is the ability for people to find out for themselves what a good price is.  There are a plethora of websites out there that can do different things for you.  There are sites like [fatwallet](http://www.fatwallet.com) that allow you to make some money off of your purchases, there are plenty like [gotapex](http://www.gotapex.com) and [slickdeals](http://www.slickdeals.net) that will point you in the right direction for big deals, and there are even sites that will help you find coupons.  You could search on google and definitely come up with coupons for particular stores that you want to buy from.  

I've seen all types of websites that will offer this for you.  Many of them are good even if they are frequented by essentially the cheapskates of the land.  But they let their money go further, and that's not a bad thing.  I happened onto a [Webbyplanet footlocker](http://www.webbyplanet.com/deals/coupon-footlocker/) coupon that seemed to be on a site that one could go to where the coupons are consolidated.  They separate the stores by category, and it seems like their site is fairly simple enough.  It allows you to access the information that you want to get to without too much surfing, and it's nice that they're not trying to endlessly spam you with advertisements in order to get to what you want.  I'm not sure that I really like the look of the styling of the site what with the colors, but I suppose that's always going to be a judgment call.

As for the Footlocker coupon, I've had experience with ordering from Footlocker's site first hand.  I have actually ordered a few pairs of athletic shoes from them, and I've found the experiences to be quite painless.  Although I did once order some cleats with their express shipping, and it didn't come in time.  But then it took so long that it passed their guarantee so I actually got the shipping free.  And that's not half bad!  I've noticed that the best times to buy are when they have their "friends and family" deal or when they have their clearance sales.  Just beware then if you wear anything besides very small or very large shoes.

Anyways so after all of these strange random thoughts, the moral is this: spend some time to use your resources!
