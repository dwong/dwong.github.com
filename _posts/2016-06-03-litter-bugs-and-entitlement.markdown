There are a lot of people out there who never learned about littering.

Who do they think is going to pick up their bags of fast food trash from the road?  The "government"?  Their parents?  Or perhaps they're just doing the world a service and allowing  people to volunteer to help out their communities.

I can understand those that want to vote for "free" benefits for themselves.  They're just trying to get by with as little work as possible.  I'm not saying that I agree.

However, just like someone is actually paying for all of those "free" benefits (medical, welfare, food stamps, etc), someone is going to be picking up the fast food trash.  So if someone doesn't understand something as simple as picking up after themselves then I hardly think that they're going to understand working for their own benefits.
