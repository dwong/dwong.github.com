Of course I dreaded it. At least it’s on the way down right now. But when I got out of my automobile to start pumping the liquid into my vehicle and my money into the machine, I saw something that took me aback. There, above the very machine that was essentially taking my money was a television! It was complete with sound and a fairly sharp display!</p> <p>Technology is amazing. They are able to put a television in a gas station!</p> <p>But then I thought for another second and realized that they must have used some of my money in order to install all of these televisions! Sure it’s nice to watch the television for about 2 minutes, but I’d much rather have the money that they used back! Just goes to show you that those gas station owners sure aren’t on hard times.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/immediate-introductions/"> Immediate Introductions </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 19</span> <p>Meeting new people is a fact of life. However, have you ever met someone after you initially saw them and recognized them? Now I might be the only one, but I doubt it. I’m not strange enough to be completely alone here.</p> <p>In any case, I’ve realized something that I think that we would all do well to know. Not meeting someone initially creates an awkward environment. After you’ve already seen them and come to recognize them without having actually met them is a situation in which both of you know that the other exists, but neither of you feel comfortable talking to the other. Not having an introduction can come about in a variety of ways:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Someone didn’t do their duty when they know both of you and introduced you.</p> </li> <li> <p>You are both slightly uncomfortable with meeting strangers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Somehow you already know about the other person, but you know that they have no idea who you are. That makes you afraid to approach them.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Okay I’m sure that there are more ways that this can happen. However it came about, if it happens to you you should know that the longer you wait to talk and/or meet the other person, the more strange it will be when you actually do. So just go for it and introduce yourself. Remember that they might feel just as strange about without knowing your name while seeing you in the halls. Or in a group of people. Or around the neighborhood. Or living right next door to you.</p> <p>The only thing that you have to do after that is not forget that you met them. Because the other person likely did not forget. And then they’ll know that you didn’t care to remember your name. Or even that they met you.</p> <p>Meet ‘em early, not often.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/blase/"> Blasé </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 18</span> <p>[blah-<strong>zey</strong>, <strong>blah</strong>-zey] adjective</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>To be indifferent, unimpressed, or uncaring because frequent exposure.</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>At first the glamor and glitz of living like a movie star was enthralling and exciting, but soon she became blasé even when she would get to fly on private planes to Paris just for lunch.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>A much better word than the more often heard “blah” wouldn’t you say?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/more-favorite-posts/"> More Favorite Posts </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 16</span> <p>And now presenting…</p> <p>favorite posts in the sidebar!</p> <p>Courtesy of the plugin that I used for my sitemap (as described in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/12/a-sitemap-for-you-and-them/">A Sitemap For You And Them</a>), there are now the top (for now 10) posts listed in the sidebar. “Popularity” is a rather arbitrary thing to decide, so my popular posts are based on a calculation using the number of views and responses.

The real finals happened in the West, probably the Suns vs Spurs series. LeBron James gets a lot of attention, but Tony Parker was the one who tore it up. I said as much before the series started that Parker was going to be their downfall.</p> <p>This was one of the least interesting finals series in a long time. Instead of watching game 4 last night, I just decided to wash my truck.</p> <p>The Cavs were so over matched they couldn’t even pull out 1 game (granted, they were close a couple of times). Even the Lakers took one from the Suns! How’s that for an insult?</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page52">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page50">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
