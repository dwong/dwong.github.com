You, doing anything you can to get a few more car lengths ahead on your commute. You, with your way of filling up every second of your time.</p> <p>So you’re too busy for me (not to mention those in your life who care about you)? Even though it’s actually difficult not to do at all, it’s fairly bothersome when someone thinks that they are inherently more important than everyone else.</p> <p>Get over it, you’re not that special.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/eight-things-count-em-up/"> Eight Things, Count 'Em Up </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 30</span> <p>I was tagged for a meme by Ms. Q over at <a href="http://qmusings.com/blog">qmusings.com/blog</a>. Thanks for the tag! Although I’m sure that many of my readers will know a lot of this already, I’m sure that there are others who don’t. Besides, I’m always up for a new idea for a post!</p> <ol> <li> <p>Each player must post these rules first.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each player starts with eight random facts/habits about themselves.</p> </li> <li> <p>People who are tagged need to write their own blog about their eight things and post these rules.</p> </li> <li> <p>At the end of your blog, you need to choose eight people to get tagged and list their names.</p> </li> <li> <p>Don’t forget to leave them a comment telling them they’re tagged, and to read your blog.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here are the eight!</p> <ol> <li> <p>I played badminton in high school. It’s not your average backyard game.</p> </li> <li> <p>I have more in common with Michael Bolton than one would think. No, not that one, the one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space">Office Space</a> fame. And he’d be angry that you thought of that one first.</p> </li> <li> <p>Before sitting on the toilet in a public restroom to do my business, I’m not satisfied with the toilet seat covers that they provide. So I put that one on first, then use about 10 squares of toilet paper to make sure that there is no butt-toilet seat contact happening.</p> </li> <li> <p>I tried to read <em>A Tale Of Two Cities</em> when I was in 4th grade. I gave up at about Chapter 3. I guess that I wasn’t as advanced as I thought!</p> </li> <li> <p>I enjoy thrift shopping so much that I would estimate that I have at least 20 articles of clothing purchased from said thrift stores.</p> </li> <li> <p>In high school I took a photography class where we got to shoot pictures using a film SLR and perform the entire process from shooting to developing to printing (and even mounting!)</p> </li> <li> <p>I’ve never been stung by a bee (or wasp or hornet or anything else that flies and has a stinger)</p> </li> <li> <p>As of this moment, I have over 22 GB of music. As well as the over 250 CD’s that I legally bought them on. (I obviously don’t like that <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/14/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid/">Music Piracy Makes People Stupid</a>)</p> </li> </ol> <p>Now I’m supposed to tag eight people. Okay so if they’d like:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Tiffany at <a href="http://www.xanga.com/TuMbaLiNa3">xanga.com/TuMbaLiNa3</a></p> </li> <li> <p>William at <a href="http://eclectiastes.blogspot.com/">Writing is Fun and Productive</a></p> </li> <li> <p>Rory at <a href="http://hamelife.com/">hamelife</a></p> </li> <li> <p>Kiki at <a href="http://www.xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427">xanga.com/GoDsChiLd1427</a> (I never realized, that upper and lower case is so annoying to type out! And both you <em>and</em> Tiffany have it!)</p> </li> </ol> <p>Okay I totally ran out of ideas of who I wanted to tag. So if you’d like to be tagged, let me know and I can. :P It’s a quick and interesting post. It was actually pretty interesting to write as well since it made me think of interesting things about myself!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/on-driving/"> On Driving </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 27</span> <p>Here’s what you should do when you’re driving.</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Weave</strong> - You mastered Gran Tourismo. Life is just like that. Everyone else is just a computer and they don’t matter. They’re just obstacles in your way to the glorious finish line!</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Swerve Suddenly and As Late As Possible</strong> - Don’t make controlled lane changes in a reasonable amount of time. Wait until the very last second and surprise everyone with what you’re going to do. The government and Google already know everything about you, why let them know what lane you’re going to change to? That’s right, stick it to the Man.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Yell At Other Drivers</strong> - Why bother being nice and full of good cheer? Inside you want to yell at them anyways. Old, young, black, white, hispanic, asian, gangsters, teenagers, rich, or poor they had no right to be there when you wanted to change into their lane. So go ahead, give ‘em an earful. And you wouldn’t want to make the tirade any less effective so go ahead and stare at them while you yell. Don’t worry about making sure not to hit someone else while you’re not looking. I already let them know that you’re going to not be paying attention so they’ll rightfully get out of your way. Because it’s all about you.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cross Double Yellow Lines</strong> - They don’t mean anything anyways. What are lines anyways? They’re just contrived barriers between us and the world. As a kid you wanted to color outside of the lines. And now as a driver you want to cross them as many times as you can. So let loose and cross them. Or better yet, just straddle the lines and pretend that the lines are like the rail that guides your Autopia car at Disneyland. That should be fun trying to sqeeze through when there are stupid cars on either side of you.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cheat In The Carpool Lane</strong> - <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/">Cheaters 4 Life</a>? Who cares, you need to get somewhere fast and the carpool lane was made for that. It’s not fair that people that decrease gas usage get to go faster. You paid good money for your vehicle and you deserve to go as fast as you are able to. Besides, you’re more important than everyone else anyways.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tailgate</strong> - Stick as close as possible to the car in front of you. “I don’t want to get into an accident,” you say. Sissy! I always say if you can’t kiss it, then you shouldn’t be staring at its rear.</p> </li> </ol> <p>So follow these simple steps and you’ll quickly be going the wrong way. However, if you’d rather be going the <strong>Wong</strong> way, use your head and don’t do any of them!</p> <p>Thanks, <a href="http://qmusings.com/blog/">Ms. Q</a> for the idea. If it goes well (people enjoy it), I’m sure that I will come up with more. So let me know what you think of it.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/thats-not-why-i-pay-taxes/"> That's Not Why I Pay Taxes </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 25</span> <p>Dear Police Officer,</p> <p>I would just like to say that I am thankful that you are around. You provide some semblance of safety and law in this crazy world. All sorts of characters cross paths with you on a daily basis, and you face the type of unknown danger that I will likely never experience.</p> <p>And yet on that note, I would like to say that you have no right to take taxpayer money and leave your stupid car on just so you would not have to experience 15 seconds of discomfort when you get back into your car. As gas is so expensive nowadays (and even worse such that I want them to <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/21/give-it-back/">Give It Back</a> after money that they have been <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/17/sneakily-selfish/">Sneakily Selfish</a> in obtaining), I know that there is definite waste going on over there.</p> <p>I could not even believe that you would leave your car in such a state. As I walked from the bank to Jamba Juice, I happened to walk near your car. I heard a sound that seemed as if something was going on. I doubled back just to check if my suspicions were true. Yep, there your car was with its engine running and nobody in the car. And you were nowhere to be found. I had seen you earlier sauntering into Corner Bakery for who knows what. Let’s hope that there was some sandwich-snatcher there that you had to apprehend.</p> <p>Some thoughts crossed my mind such as I wonder how crazy it would be to open the door (for you must have left it open if your key was in the ignition) and take off with your car or how lazy and in need of comfort must you be to do such a thing! Sure I understand that at 80 degrees in California, you’ve got it bad. Real bad. Life is hard and A/C is the only thing that can save you.</p> <p>But you did all of this on my dime. Yes, mine. I do not give money to the government so that you can do this. Okay well I mainly give money because I have to. But if I did have a choice, I would not give it so that you could do that! Please think about what you’re doing next time. Or I’m going to have a talking with you. Alright, I’ll probably just <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/tag/rant">rant</a> about it again on my blog. But it will be an angrier one!</p> <p>So stop it. No one likes a <del>leach</del> leech. They just want to squash them. Or if you’re Bear Grylls of <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/29/man-vs-wild-rawr/">Man vs Wild (rawr!)</a> fame, you’d eat ‘em.</p> <p>Sincerely, Derek</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/why-hype-up-the-iphone/"> Why Hype Up The iPhone? </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jun 23</span> <p>Is it just me, or is it tiring listening to things getting hyped up? More specifically, I’m rather tired of reading and seeing the iPhone everywhere. If you don’t know, the iPhone is the new upcoming cellular phone that combines the media and ease of use of an iPod with the web browsing and touchscreen of a smart phone.</p> <p>Sounds good doesn’t it? Well I’m sure that it will be nice, but it’s not going to be the end all to everything. I don’t even get why there is such a tremendous amount of hype! Everyone is completely enamored with Apple products all of a sudden even if they’re simply a good-looking product that does not even have anything new to offer (look up Apple TV). Sure they have some real nice products, but not everything that they touch is going to turn to gold.</p> <p>Smart phones have existed. Touchscreens have existed. Phones that can play music and video have existed. Devices that can access the Internet have existed.</p> <p>So the only new thing is something that does these things from Apple. How novel. How worth $500. Coming this upcoming week to an Apple fanatic near you.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page52">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page50">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
