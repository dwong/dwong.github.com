          Tips For Saving Gas
	</a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">Jul 16</span>

      <p>In these current days of high gas prices (currently around $4.50/gallon where I live), it pays to do as much as possible out of what you have.  And while I am not ever going to be a hyper-miler, I can at least do as well as I can.  (It’s hard to get superb gas mileage when you drive a truck.)</p>

<p>While I do drive a less than ideal automobile, I am still able to get 20 MPG.  And that might not sound too impressive to most people, but for trucks that’s not bad.  But besides that, the tips are still good.  They’re by no means new, though.  But I didn’t just read it on some other site and paste them here.  And remember, sometimes it’s just fine to be <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/07/02/coming-up-with-it-yourself/">Coming Up With It Yourself</a>.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Minimize Braking</strong> - This is of the utmost concern.  Some of the other tips could also be generalized to this.  Why is braking bad?  Well every moment of braking is a moment where energy that was expended by gas is being needlessly lost.  That is, you get the most use out of your gas when you’re not braking at all because all of the energy from the gas is being used to power the vehicle.  And while this is not feasible with the traffic laws that we have, it’s still a true fact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Coast Into Red Lights</strong> - When you see a red light up ahead, don’t continue with your foot on the accelerator!  Why are you in a rush to sit at a red light?  Instead, take it easy on the accelerator and ride out your momentum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cruise Control Is Your Friend</strong> - For periods of driving that are going to be stop-free, utilize that cruise control.  The car will consistently apply gas to continue at the speed that the cruise control is set at.  And the car will probably do it better than your attempts at keeping your foot steady.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Coast Down Hills</strong> - Gravity will accelerate your vehicle down the hill.  So put your transmission into neutral (this is more normal with a manual transmission) and let gravity work its magic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Turn Off The Car</strong> - Instead of idling, turn the car off when you know that you’re going to be sitting for awhile.  While most modern cars are not built to constantly be turned on and off (like at every red light), it’s probably best to turn it off if you’re waiting for someone to run into the store.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proper Maintenance</strong> - It’s hard to do your best when your vehicle isn’t up to snuff.  So keep up with those oil changes, regularly inflate those tires, and make sure everything is as the manufacturer intended.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Slow Down</strong> - Probably one of the most important, this has numerous benefits besides gas savings including (but not limited to) overall safety.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These seem simple enough.  An added bonus for doing all of this is decreased road rage.  You’ll care more about what’s going on with you and your vehicle than you will about how that jerk cut you off.  Save a headache, save some money.</p>

      <p>Discrimination isn’t great.  That much is obvious to most people.</p>

<p>Isn’t it strange, then, that it seems like most people will indeed discriminate against others if they are in the majority?  That is, people that might be discriminated against for whatever reason in one location will discriminate others when they’re somewhere else.</p>

<p>What is within man that we do such things?  Is it egocentricity?  Original sin?</p>

      <p>Have you ever realized that there are so many things that you do <em>not</em> know?  I mean, even besides the things that humanity doesn’t know (e.g. the cure to any of a whole slew of diseases, the details of all of the other planets and galaxies, where Amelia Earhart is), there are things that you just don’t know like how to program a complex program, how DNA works, how to create a bookcase from a tree, how to cook a perfect turkey for Thanksgiving, and the list goes on endlessly.</p>

<p>So in life, we’re always learning.  You’ve probably heard that it’s pretty good for you to learn something new everyday.  And I concur, that’s a great thing.  Having an open mind, being amazed, willing to be taught.  It’s all swell!</p>

<p>I’m interested, though, in how there are differences to learning.  There is the kind that we learn because someone has taught us (i.e. in the classroom setting at school), but there is also the learning that comes out of a totally different intelligence/mind set.  While the former is good, I’m apt to think that the latter is even better.</p>

<p>Newton, Socrates, Einstein among a few all had to come up with things on their own.  They used logic, research, and intuition to arrive at the results that we now know all about today.  And while there are many things that have been figured out already, it’s still pretty good for someone to separately arrive at the correct solution without having been taught it explicitly.  At least I think so.</p>

<p>So do you know anyone that solved the Rubik’s cube without looking at the answer?  Yeah me neither.  Give the people that figure it out on their own their due.</p>

          Google Code Jam 2008

      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">Jun 28</span>

      <p>While many of my readers are totally uninterested in the fact that I program computers, the fact remains that I do what I do.  And thankfully I enjoy it (well at least most of the time).  Geeky as it sounds, I’ve also found that I kind of like to occasionally participate in programming contests.</p>

<p>I participated in the last Google Code Jam in 2006, but I didn’t fare all that well.  Of course, that might also be because I decided to open up the problem and then go eat lunch after reading through it.  And did I mention that I only got an hour to work on it once I opened it?  I could have at least solved that problem!  I only needed 5 more minutes!  Although, I’m pretty sure that I wouldn’t have solved another so I still wouldn’t have done very well.</p>

<p>Anyways, to make a long story short, I enjoy programming.  And programming contests like this can be fun!  I’m currently trying out some of their practice problems, and I’m going to go with Python as my language of choice (last time I went with C++).</p>

<p>I don’t particularly have high hopes for how well I can do, but it’s still fun to try!  It’s free, and fun (for some people).</p>

<p>[<a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/">Google Code Jam</a>]</p>

<p>Update: I suck!  I solved one problem’s (Train Schedule) small input, but I couldn’t quite get another problem (Saving the Universe) to work correctly.  However since they don’t test the large input until the end, I found out that my large didn’t pass!  And that means that I do not move out of the qualification.  Boo to me.</p>

          Awkwardness
	</a>
      </h1>

      <span class="post-date">Jun 25</span>

      <p>In a world that advances in technology, conveniences, and all sorts of other benefits, it is comforting to know that some things do not change.  No matter where we go, no matter how high we fly, awkwardness will never leave us!  Oh hooray!</p>

<p>More than that, it seems like things are getting worse.  What with the age of the computer upon us, our social interactions are changing rather dramatically pretty quickly.  Children, instead of playing with the other neighborhood kids, will play games online with strangers they’ve never actually met.  And while I am not opposed to playing games (I’ve played a game or two myself), you must admit that it is changing things up.  Instead of being active, we’re watching more television.  The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Even beyond childhood, we are maintaining our relationships through this newfangled phenomenon called the Internet.  On websites for all sorts of topics and aims, we are interacting with people in a whole new way.  We consider people that we’ve never met in real life our friends.  We spend countless hours writing on blogs (kind of like this one!).  You get the point.  I don’t think that these things are bad in and of themselves, they are bringing our society to a place where social skills are declining.</p>

<p>On a related but slightly different note, is it just me or has the word awkward encroached everyday conversation over the past few years?  And somehow, I don’t think that helps fight against the awkwardness.  While it does seem amusing at times, I’ve grown to dislike it quite wholeheartedly.  Perhaps it’s because any amusement is always coming at someone’s expense.  Someone who usually cannot afford to be laughed at.  Or maybe it’s because I’d much prefer if everyone were comfortable instead.  Whatever the reason, awkwardness is no good.</p>

<p>Or am I the only one?</p>
