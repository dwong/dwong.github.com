Those who can’t – teach. -H.L. Mencken</p> </blockquote> <p>An oft heard saying that strikes deep at the hearts of every teacher around. It’s not hard to find a pupil or person who is willing to use the saying for someone that they are forced to listen to. While I don’t often say it (seems rather blatantly disrespectful, wouldn’t you say?), sometimes I can see where the quote might have come from.</p> <p>Have you met people that freely give their opinion on anything that they encounter? Yeah that person is called a know-it-all. They’re a KIA. Without the 10 year/100,000 mile warranty. Hardy har har. But they really are a pet peeve of mine. Most people aren’t fond of KIAs however when I encounter one I have this immense urge to prove them wrong.</p> <p>KIAs are a proud and arrogant bunch who at their core probably are a little unsure of themselves. And thus the need to prove their superiority over everyone else.</p> <p>I would like to make the distinction at this point between those that think that they know it all as opposed to those that actually do know quite a bit. KIAs are those that think that they know it all. But they don’t. While they have an opinion on everything, you only need to be well-versed in one of the things that they talk about to know that they don’t know as much as it might seem. However, there really are people that know their stuff. And to them I say bravo. It’s funny how those that actually know a lot seem to think that they know so little while those that know very little seem to feign knowing much, huh?</p> <p>Anyway, so that point is that I don’t like listening to people give me their opinion on something that I’m doing when they have no experience in the matter themselves. If they have no experience, then they obviously do not entirely know what they are talking about. It’s even worse when I know that they don’t even have the capacity for it.</p> <p>Take exercising for example. While I’m not an amazing athlete or anything, it’s hard to listen to those who’ve never run a mile give their advice on my running. To someone who will not even raise a finger for their own well-being, you do not get to sit on the sideline and critique my effort.</p> <p>I give brownie points for trying your best. Perseverance is not something to be taken lightly. But if you’re not even willing to give it a shot? You might as well be talking to a wall. At least it won’t try to prove you wrong!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/mementos/"> Mementos </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 24</span> <p>In the journey of life, we have our ups and we have our downs. How insightful of me to say, huh? But along the way we each have the chance to collect little mementos that remind us of the stops along the way.[caption id=”” align=”alignleft” width=”240” caption=”Photo courtesy of Flickr user Cindy47452”]<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/cindy47452/1021782142/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3168/2884620650_831cfeb7b8_m.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of Flickr user Cindy47452"/></a>[/caption]</p> <p>While some people don’t have a care in the world for things that remind them of the past, others like to keep them for those occasional times when they’d like to wax nostalgic. Some like to show them off to everyone, and others enjoy the opportunity to pull out ugly pictures, sappy love notes, and the like in order to have a chuckle or two even if it’s just by themselves.</p> <p>I bet you can guess which I like to do. Because oh do I do enjoy it.</p> <p>Anyways whatever the reason, I like to tell people to at least keep a box of the good stuff. Even for those that want to clean up everything, the chance to look back on the path that you’ve traveled is a chance that you don’t want to miss. Trust me, it’s fun.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/only-one-first/"> Only One First </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 18</span> <p>Nobody wants to be a copy. But there has to be copies.</p> <p>Logically, there can only be a single person who is first. Buzz Aldrin wasn’t it. Neither was John Adams. While that doesn’t mean that they were any less impressive, it does mean that they didn’t get to be the first in their respective areas.</p> <p>But many people are not satisfied to simply be doing something that has already been done. They want to be first. So they make claims that mean nothing. They state that they’ve invented the wheel without realizing that history says differently. They’re either <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/08/06/ignorance-bliss/">blissfully ignorant</a> or possibly a little more nefarious than that.</p> <p>This strikes deeper than simply attaining to some unknown peak. While for some people it might just be reaching for great things, it seems like those that make claims of “revolutionizing” something are just stuck in a world without the wild west to explore. They’re inventing frontiers where there is already a well-worn road. And they’re doing it because they can’t stand the thought of not doing something worthwhile in their lifetime.</p> <p>Everyone wants to be a standout somehow. And you can. You don’t need to falsify your achievements to do it. In fact, perhaps it’ll come even quicker if you stop looking so hard for it.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/what-happened-usher-raymond-iv/"> What Happened Usher Raymond IV? </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 14</span> <p>Can I just say after watching the music videos for Usher’s songs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqqY07OZWps">Love In This Club</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64EjuSEXsYg">Moving Mountains</a> that I think that he is like R. Kelly (aka certifiably crazy)? Please, does anyone remember R. Kelly’s Trapped In The Closet series?</p> <p>On the one hand, I’m laughing hysterically. But on the other this is just out of hand.</p> <p>Edit: Must be because of their collaboration on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlqdxZcgnZg">Same Girl</a></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/eafp/"> EAFP </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 10</span> <p>There are a couple of types of people in the world. There are some that want to make sure that all is well before they proceed and then there are those that will just do things without thinking about the consequences.</p> <p>There is a related idea in computer programming. You can check all of the variables, program state, and other circumstances. When everything is kosher, you go for it. And hopefully you are successful. The problem with this, though, is that you might forget to check something. Perhaps you haven’t accounted for everything as you should have. Then what? Then disaster! (Or something like that.)</p> <p>On the other hand, there is another idea that can be used. It is the idea (at least in <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>) that it is <strong>E</strong>asier to <strong>A</strong>sk for <strong>F</strong>orgiveness than <strong>P</strong>ermission (i.e., EAFP). This way of dealing with errors is to go for the gusto and then deal with problems as they arise.</p> <p>I need a little more EAFP.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page33">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page31">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
