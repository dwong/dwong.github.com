<div class="entry-content"><h3>Chicago Bulls vs Miami Heat</h3>

<p>You&#8217;ve gotta hand it to the Bulls, they can roll.  I enjoyed watching them tear up the Heat.  Although I don&#8217;t think that I hold any ill feelings toward Shaquille O&#8217;Neal for leaving the Lakers, I&#8217;m not a big Heat fan.  I&#8217;m not even sure what it is.  I just don&#8217;t really care for them.  I think that Wade is overrated (although good), and the rest of the team is just a bunch of cocky goons (namely Antoine Walker).</p>

<h3>Golden State Warriors vs Dallas Mavericks</h3>

<p>Though never really a fan of the Warriors, I&#8217;ve also never really been opposed to them.  I&#8217;ve enjoyed watching their series against the Mavericks.  However, I thought it quite disappointing that they couldn&#8217;t close out against them last night with a <strong>nine</strong> point lead with a few minutes left!  That&#8217;s too bad.  I&#8217;m a fan of how strong Baron Davis and Jason Richardson are playing.  I&#8217;m not really a fan of Stephen Jackson because I think that he&#8217;s a crybaby.  And Al Harrington?  Forgot to show up.  Here&#8217;s hoping that they close it out for real next time and send Mark Cuban &amp; Co. packing.</p>

<h3>Los Angeles Lakers vs Phoenix Suns</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ll always be a fan of the Lakers.  But they have been straight-up disappointing nearly the entire year!  Kobe is pretty amazing sometimes (everyone <em>has</em> to admit that), but he both can&#8217;t do everything and can&#8217;t always be so amazing.  Until they either get a real team or they learn to work together consistently, they won&#8217;t ever get very far in the playoffs.  All of the other teams are just too good to monkey around every night.  I&#8217;ll be cheering for the Suns in a week (even though they talked a little too much before the series started about how they&#8217;d steamroll the Lakers).</p>

<h3>Cleveland Cavaliers vs Washington Wizards</h3>

<p>I watched part of the game on Sunday.  I fell asleep.  That&#8217;s pretty much all you need to know about this series.</p>

<h3>Denver Nuggets vs San Antonio Spurs</h3>

<p>I thought the Nuggets could pull something off, especially after the first game.  But the Spurs seem relentless.  And Robert Horry must dream throughout the entire season about making those big playoff shots.  The series isn&#8217;t that close, but it&#8217;s still fairly entertaining.</p>

<h3>New Jersey Nets vs Toronto Raptors</h3>

<p>I think the Nets should have been finished with the series already.</p>

<h3>Orlando Magic vs Detroit Pistons</h3>

<p>Why did they even have to play this series?  I thought they would be better.  But the Magic players never showed up at the same time.  Something must have been wrong with their alarm clocks.  Maybe they need five alarms.</p>

<h3>Houston Rockets vs Utah Jazz</h3>

<p>Rooting for the Rockets.  They have showed glimpses of how far they could go with their 1-2 combo of McGrady and Yao.  However, it hasn&#8217;t been consistent enough to knock out the Jazz yet.  Chinese guy?  I&#8217;m for the Rockets.  Plus they&#8217;ve got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafer_Alston">Skip To My Lou</a>!  You&#8217;ve gotta cheer for that guy.  Even if he does have the worst Field Goal % in the NBA.</p>
