There are some that want to make sure that all is well before they proceed and then there are those that will just do things without thinking about the consequences.</p> <p>There is a related idea in computer programming. You can check all of the variables, program state, and other circumstances. When everything is kosher, you go for it. And hopefully you are successful. The problem with this, though, is that you might forget to check something. Perhaps you haven’t accounted for everything as you should have. Then what? Then disaster! (Or something like that.)</p> <p>On the other hand, there is another idea that can be used. It is the idea (at least in <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>) that it is <strong>E</strong>asier to <strong>A</strong>sk for <strong>F</strong>orgiveness than <strong>P</strong>ermission (i.e., EAFP). This way of dealing with errors is to go for the gusto and then deal with problems as they arise.</p> <p>I need a little more EAFP.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/finish-line-mirage/"> Finish Line Mirage </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Sep 4</span> <p>When I was at UCSD for my undergraduate program in Computer Science, I had a professor who told a story about working on a project. For the project, he was creating a new software system (the purpose of which I have since forgotten). He told how he was fairly quick in the design and starting of the program. There was steady progress until he was about 80% done.</p> <p>He continued to work on it (because as you well know 80% is getting pretty close to 100%). However, with new changes, he kept discovering that more work needed to be done. He would have to go back over his code to change things that he thought that he had previously addressed. The thing was, the further along he got, the more he discovered that he wasn’t nearly as close as he thought. So while he got further along, the end remained elusively close and yet not quite close enough.</p> <p>While he was talking about the difficulties of the complete software development process, I also feel like the same troubles can affect me. (Haha and sometimes it happens to me in the software development process.) I make strides when there is much to be done. But then things start getting down near the end. I can see the end. Or at least I think that I can. But things keep popping up that keep me from getting there. Things will get done, but for some reason it feels like I’m going nowhere fast.</p> <p>From experience I’ve realized that I have to keep churning away at it until I’ve gotten there. When you’re climbing the hill, the end has to be the toughest (I mean, you’ve already spent all of that energy getting to where you’re at). But that triumphant moment when you get there, that’s worth it. Or, at least it usually is.</p> <p><em>(Notice: Don’t climb mountains that you’re physically incapable of completing. I am just making my small commentary on life. I am in no way, shape, or form responsible if you actually fall off the side of a mountain.)</em></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/inconsiderate-actions/"> Inconsiderate Actions </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 27</span> <p>Does anyone else wish that people thought about others more? I can’t stand it when people think that their actions have no consequences for other people!</p> <p>Sometimes people will do horrible and disgusting things. Sometimes they’ll even admit that it’s wrong. Sometimes, though, it goes beyond reason when they do horrible things, and justify themselves to others with the opinion that it won’t affect other people.</p> <p>Spit out your gum? Yeah, it’ll get on people’s shoes (or even my car!). That is not a happy moment.</p> <p>Throw your trash onto the street? Someone has to pick it up, and it most likely is not going to be your mother. It’s going to be some poor soul who has to clean up your mess.</p> <p>These things? These are the least of the offenses. The world is full of them.</p> <p>Related:</p> <ul> <li> <p><a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/17/inconsiderate-internet-browsing/">Inconsiderate Internet Browsing</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/08/28/sneezing-coughingkeep-it-to-yourself/">Sneezing, Coughing…Keep It To Yourself</a></p> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/indebted/"> Indebted </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 20</span> <p>In today’s world, there is a high priority placed on independence and individuality. I know that I value this in myself and in others.</p> <p>While some think that fellowship and community are important, it seems to me that there is a distinctly positive association with being able to think and act of one’s own accord. In the workplace, this is obviously true because any employer would want someone who can figure out what’s wrong and solve something on their own without their manager’s every guiding instruction. But even outside of the workplace people like to see people who will help without being asked, not have to be told what to do every step of the way, and can come up with new ideas on their own.</p> <p>Perhaps in this Randian society where man is elevated to the heroic nature that he is, we have gone even further such that our value system has become more sharply focused. That is, instead of praising society, we praise the individual.</p> <p>As a Christian, though, I shouldn’t have such a high regard for the things that each of us can do on our own. I should feel indebted.</p> <p>Christianity, at its roots, holds the message that we have something that we have done zero work for. The work that Jesus Christ did on the cross has made my sin null and void. And that is a wonderful thing! So while I can still appreciate independence in action, I need to always remember that ultimately I cannot hold it against others when they do not. For what do I hold over them? Nothing. I should forgive my debts, for I am forgiven mine.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/confusing-addresses/"> Confusing Addresses </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Aug 13</span> <p>For those that have ever driven in areas that are unfamiliar, I’m sure that you can sympathize with my distaste for confusing addresses.</p> <p>The thing is, it’s so unnecessary! Why must city planners do things like:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Same name but differing suffixes (e.g., Boulevard, Street, and Circle)</p> </li> <li> <p>Same number for multiple prefixes (e.g., 111 North Main St and 111 South Main St)</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-numerical order. This can happen sometimes when changing cities. And it’s no good!</p> </li> <li> <p>Non-standard street behavior. I’m talking about the one way street, the blocking island in the road that restricts cars from entering roads from certain directions, or even a strange break in the road!</p> </li> <li> <p>Buildings where you can’t see the address numbers! Alright so maybe it’s more the fault of the builders of each building. But still, it’s annoying.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I am Derek, therefore I rant. Haha. So will city planners listen? Doubtful, indeed.</p> <p>Obviously my deal with it is that I don’t like getting lost. Who really does?</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page32">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page30">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
