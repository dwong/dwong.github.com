    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Crom is a man who works early.<br/>
He definitely does not have hair that&rsquo;s curly.<br/>
He likes to have <a href="/crom-the-one-who-loveshates-his-girlfriend/">interesting</a> chats.<br/>
I highly doubt he works out the lats.<br/></p>

<p>He is quite a unique one, that Crom is.<br/>
Of that I am telling the truth, I promise.<br/>
He walks about with a full bowl of food,<br/>
And <a href="/crom-the-one-who-cuts-his-toenails-at-work/">does things</a> that some might think of as rude.<br/></p>

<p>He tells bad jokes<br/>
To most any of the folks.<br/>
Worst of all when it&rsquo;s about work and he&rsquo;s on the phone<br/>
He tells me and my friends to lower our tone.<br/></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very strange since there are rooms.<br/>
I mean, you can&rsquo;t make noise like you can in the <a href="/crom-the-loud-one/">restrooms</a>.<br/>
At the least he can watch out to not be so loud,<br/>
But that lack of self-examination is what sets him apart from the crowd.<br/></p>
