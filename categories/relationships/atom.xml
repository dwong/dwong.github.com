    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are unlimited amounts of material to help you find your soul mate, date online, and analyze yourself so that you can date better.  How can you even begin to start all of that if people can&rsquo;t even agree on the definition.  Some people think that a date must involve mutual feelings.  Others think that you have to use the word &ldquo;date&rdquo; for it to count.  Semantics, people!</p>

<h3>Date</h3>

<ul>
<li>noun - Prearranged meeting between a male and a female for some period of time greater than 10 minutes</li>
<li>verb - Spending time socially with one other person of the opposite sex</li>
</ul>


<p>People are going to object to my definitions.  In fact people have already objected to my definitions!  But stick to them, and your wariness might prove to save you untold heartache from a lack of communication.  At the worst, these definitions are going to force you to communicate about what people&rsquo;s intentions rather than drawing your own assumptions.</p>

<p>And remember everyone, assumptions are a fast track to trouble.</p>
