    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately I have been reading and enjoying <a href="http://biggovernment.com/">Big Government</a>, which is a website created by Andrew Breitbart.  It is a website that advocates a smaller government by exposing the ways that the government is improperly doing things.  It is definitely enlightening because the articles attempt to show the readers ways that our very own federal government (of the United States of America) are doing things that most of us would very likely disapprove of.  And boy do we!  (Or at least...I do.)  Compounding the problem is that many of these things do not even seem legal in light of the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/512/10th-amendment/">10th amendment</a>!</p>

<p>This isn't a long post and really I am not adding anything to the collective knowledge or opinion of the Internet.  However I have been enjoying some of the videos that I have seen there and would therefore like to share:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pork is delicious when it means the consumed meat from a pig.  Conversely it is awful when it refers to the appropriations of government money for local projects.  While I might be a big supporter of the former, let's not forget that the late Senator Robert Byrd was a huge proponent of the latter.</p>

<p>When he passed, I heard a radio commentator quote an unnamed source from West Virginia saying that they would not know what to do now that he wasn't in Washington to send federal funds back to them.  It makes sense for them to think this way because he sent back billions to them during his tenure (Citizens Against Government Waste has a <a href="http://www.cagw.org/newsroom/byrd-pork-tally.html">tally of Senator Byrd's pork</a> that will boggle the mind).  So it is true, they just lost a major source of income.  What's a person to do?!  I have an idea: start making your own way instead of swiping money from the rest of the country.</p>

<p>I am sure that the people of West Virginia are not the only ones.  There are recipients of pork everywhere, and they should all be ashamed.  This corruption needs to stop.  We all know that politicians are self-serving, power-hungry individuals.  Do not feed them your vote <strong>or</strong> willingly eat their pork!  Does anyone think about the fact that the politicians are taking money from everyone else just so that they can remain in office?  It seems like pork barrel politics could also be called much much worse.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have frequently heard people advocating government jobs.  That is, the people that I know will talk about how good it is to be a government employee.  They talk about the pension, benefits, and job security, to name a few.  All of these things are true.  But just as the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/519/unions-will-get-you-for-sure/">unions</a> will get you in the private sector, so also will the unions affect the public sector.  Sometimes the unions in the government are organized, but one could make a case for the entire federal government being one gigantic union that stands against their employer (aka the American people).</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-12-10-federal-pay-salaries_N.htm">USA Today article</a>, we find out that things are in fact not too good.  People are being paid quite a bit nowadays, don't you think?  It is especially interesting that there has been such a boom in government increases during the same time as the private sector losing so many jobs.  And by interesting I mean awfully disturbing.  The government is becoming a behemoth that is going to continue growing until it collapses and knocks down the support columns that hold up this house.</p>

<p>The thing that I do not understand in the least is how people in government positions can work without the fear of being fired!  Whether incompetent or able, they will keep their job (unless perhaps they are grossly ill-performing where even then it will take quite some effort to make a move on them).  So when people are presented with the option to try their best or do as little as possible with both seeming to result in the same outcome, what would people do?  Exactly, they would do the least possible.  There is no incentive for people in government jobs to continue to do their best.  Now you see what I am saying about the government employees being similar to a union.</p>

<p>Just as the unions have been able to cripple portions of the private sector (such as the American automakers), it is going to be the government employees that are going to bring down the government.  If you have not read what unions can do to the world, I suggest that you read the ever popular <em><a href="http://amzn.to/PuUYqb">Atlas Shrugged</a></em> by Ayn Rand.</p>

<p>All of the signs are there.  <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/675/health-care-reform/">Health care reform</a> that will dictate much more than we need or want it to, a growing government influence in our lives, a government that dictates what companies will do (since it owns them), perhaps even the degradation of freedoms to which we are rightly entitled to under the Constitution.  This is something that concerns all of us, and we all need to care about it.  Because we sure are going to have the live with the consequences together.  And disregarding warning is a terribly foolhardy thing to do.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nobody likes to pay for health services.  And health services are not perfect at all.  They (medical professionals) charge more than what seems reasonable, and they do not seem to have to answer to anybody except for the health insurance companies because they only listen to the money.  It would be nice to have personal doctors and nurses to tend to your every whim.  And it would be nice if you did not have to pay anything for it.</p>

<p>But this is not how the world works.  For one, medical professionals are people as well.  I am talking about doctors, not the rank and file like <a href="http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org">medical coding</a> staff and assistants.  These are individuals who have gone to school, invested hours and nights to their profession.  (Well at least I hope that they have.  The ones that have not are not ones that I would ever want to go to.)  Their work is indeed important, and it is at times worth the cost.</p>

<p>People sometimes claim that a single entity watching over the entire operation here in the United States will be more efficient.  More efficient?  Since when did a government project ever win awards for efficiency??  Yeah that's a pretty crazy <a href="http://docs.house.gov/gopleader/House-Democrats-Health-Plan.pdf">health plan chart</a>, isn't it?  It is only a guess at what the new health government would look like, but it sure is a scary one.</p>

<p>If everyone has access to all of the doctors, people are going to take as much as they can.  Do you think that you will get to pay the best doctor what he/she is charging?  Well when everything costs the same for everyone it just logically follows that the best doctors are going to be as busy as people can schedule appointments.  People dismiss the supposed "death panels" that will decide on life and death decisions for everyone, but if there is a shortage of supply (doctors) compared to the increase in demand (patients) then some of those patients will have to be left out.  There is just no possible other way for that outcome to be different.</p>

<p>It is pretty debatable whether or not other countries have succeeded at this or not.  That is not really the question.  The question is: do I really want to cede more control over my life to the federal government?  To that I say no, I am still a huge fan of the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/512/10th-amendment/">10th amendment</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/unions-will-get-you-for-sure/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Labor unions have their origins as recently as the 18th century and in the United States of America in the 19th century.  Quite simply a union is an entity that represents the collective interests of its members, often associated with workers of a similar profession.  They were extremely important in yesteryear when "the Man" would snuff the very life out of people with his unyielding desire for more profit, even at the expense of people's lives.  Unions were an answer to this vileness.  They allowed the workers to stand united against injustice and fight for their rights as human beings.</p>

<p>But now <em>they</em> are getting despicable.</p>

<p>In striving for (or at least claiming to strive for) the best possible situations for its members, the power-hungry leaders of unions are wielding weapons that they seem ill-equipped to handle.  They know only to grab all that they can at no expense.  There are so many different groups reaching for as much as they possibly can that they threaten the very structures upon which they stand!</p>

<p>Unions make it easy for people to get as much as they can while also being protecting from punishment for not doing their job.  Do you think that it's a coincidence that the automakers in Detroit have huge unions and are also now going bankrupt?  What about the education system (especially locally in southern California) that is floundering for money?  Those teacher unions sure are big and powerful, aren't they?  I say that if they had just been reasonable about what they wanted and did (e.g., protecting from unjust terminations instead of deserved terminations) then perhaps we all would be a little bit better off.</p>

<p>In the United States of America, we stand for things.  Our Constitution says that we have rights.  But those rights do not include a guaranteed source of income nor a completely secure job.  We are not entitled to a house nor do we deserve free health care, but I digress.  Our rights do include the ability to work as hard as you can to achieve things.  And in our current society, it sure seems like we could get ride of unions and let the best of the workers survive (because they will always be sought after as good workers).</p>
