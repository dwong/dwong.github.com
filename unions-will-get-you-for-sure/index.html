<div class="entry-content"><p>Labor unions have their origins as recently as the 18th century and in the United States of America in the 19th century.  Quite simply a union is an entity that represents the collective interests of its members, often associated with workers of a similar profession.  They were extremely important in yesteryear when &#8220;the Man&#8221; would snuff the very life out of people with his unyielding desire for more profit, even at the expense of people&#8217;s lives.  Unions were an answer to this vileness.  They allowed the workers to stand united against injustice and fight for their rights as human beings.</p>

<p>But now <em>they</em> are getting despicable.</p>

<p>In striving for (or at least claiming to strive for) the best possible situations for its members, the power-hungry leaders of unions are wielding weapons that they seem ill-equipped to handle.  They know only to grab all that they can at no expense.  There are so many different groups reaching for as much as they possibly can that they threaten the very structures upon which they stand!</p>

<p>Unions make it easy for people to get as much as they can while also being protecting from punishment for not doing their job.  Do you think that it&#8217;s a coincidence that the automakers in Detroit have huge unions and are also now going bankrupt?  What about the education system (especially locally in southern California) that is floundering for money?  Those teacher unions sure are big and powerful, aren&#8217;t they?  I say that if they had just been reasonable about what they wanted and did (e.g., protecting from unjust terminations instead of deserved terminations) then perhaps we all would be a little bit better off.</p>

<p>In the United States of America, we stand for things.  Our Constitution says that we have rights.  But those rights do not include a guaranteed source of income nor a completely secure job.  We are not entitled to a house nor do we deserve free health care, but I digress.  Our rights do include the ability to work as hard as you can to achieve things.  And in our current society, it sure seems like we could get ride of unions and let the best of the workers survive (because they will always be sought after as good workers).</p>
