However I became ambivalent as Baron Davis’ personality (as well as Stephen Jackson’s) came out. That elbow to Derek Fisher’s face? Unnecessary to the extreme. To say that I gained a lot and lost a lot of respect for the Warriors would be fair to say. I enjoyed their playing because they were passionate and energetic. I started to disapprove of them because many of them turned out to be a bunch of no-class, cocky-without-rights-to, complaining-to-no-end players. And that is not a team that I want to cheer for. So they’re out, and good riddance.</p> <p>A lot of people disliked <strong>Derek Fisher</strong> when he was on the Lakers. I never felt as strongly about him. In fact, I kind of liked him. He had spirit and he played hard. Plus we share the same first name. He’s by no means the best at his position, but he’s definitely shown in the Jazz vs Warriors series that he’s got lots left in that tank. To see him also having to deal with everything going on with his daughter makes him an especially easy-to-cheer-for player. Bravo on being an impact player in the series.</p> <p>There sure has been a lot of <strong>testiness</strong> in these playoffs. Is it just me or does it seem like there is more this year than in recent history? Pretty much every series has had some episode of a flareup. LeBron is stepping up, the Pistons are never exactly clean, the aforementioned Warriors and Jazz got it on, and of course the Suns and the Spurs have no love lost for their fellow Texans. It all makes for exciting and emotional games, but I kind of wonder why this year is so.</p> <p>I’m cheering for the <strong>Chicago Bulls</strong> to beat the Pistons. I’m not a huge Bulls fan, but I have enjoyed watching them play this year. Unfortunately they seem like they go very cold at times, and that led to the Pistons taking a (seemingly) insurmountable 3-0 series lead on them. They’ve fought back to 3-2, and everyone has been singing their praise. I’d like to see them down the vaunted Pistons myself.</p> <p>I barely even hear or see much from the <strong>Cleveland Cavaliers</strong> side of the bracket. The Wizards series went down very quietly. It’s no surprise, but the West seems to definitely be the better conference.</p> <p><strong>Robert Horry’s forearm to Nash’s face</strong> was pretty poor. I always kind of liked Horry because I enjoyed his late-game heroics. I’m not really sure what the beef between the Suns and the Spurs is, but I know this: they don’t like each other. I’m not a fan of many of them myself. Many of them (Manu Ginobili, Bruce Bowen, Raja Bell to name a few) are aggressive bordering on extremely dirty. And that’s no good. But I like watching the series because both of these teams are pretty good. They have different styles but they both have multiple superstars who combine to do amazing things sometimes.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>The NBA Playoffs 2007 are definitely interesting. I like seeing people get emotional, but there’s no need to be a jerk about things. Keep it coming. I’m going to enjoy watching more.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/chopped-returns-in-perl/"> Chopped Returns (In Perl) </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 16</span> <p>Files on computers are made up of different characters that are interpreted by whatever it is that you are using. That means that no matter what file it is, it is essentially a string of bytes that are interpreted by the program opening it. This means that your music program tries to interpret whatever file you open with it to be conformed to some audio standards (mp3, wma, etc.). Try to open the same file in a text editor, and you’ll find yourself looking at (apparently) junk characters. But then you’ll realize that the file is still just a bunch of characters.</p> <p>I bring this up because</p> <ol> <li> <p>It seems as if people don’t realize this.</p> </li> <li> <p>I encountered this while writing a Perl script today.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Something else that you should read even if you don’t know what Perl is: Windows and Unix-variants (including Mac OS X and up) do not handle files the same. I’m not talking about <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/28/fanaticism/">Fanaticism</a> (because I’ve already posted about that). Windows uses characters that are referred to as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return">Carriage Return</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_feed">Line Feed</a> in order to represent a newline. These names originate because of their original use in the typewriter which actually had a physical mechanism to move. In any case, Unix-variants utilize the line feed character to distinguish its newlines. This can obviously lead to some problems if you use the same files on both systems.</p> <p><strong>If you don’t know what Perl is then you can fairly safely stop reading this article now because the rest won’t help you much.</strong> I know that it was hard for me to find and I’d like to make it available if anyone else so happens to run into the same problem.</p> <p>While writing a script in Perl today, I had a seemingly strange problem where I would do some processing on my Windows machine and then transfer the file via FTP to a Unix-based server. However I noticed that I had a string that when printed to the screen on my Windows computer would display correctly but would display incorrectly in the file put onto the server. I could not figure this out for quite sometime because it seemed as if some of the lines were printing correctly and some were not. Alright enough explanation. Essentially I thought that the last character was getting chopped off in some way that I did not understand in Perl. However it had to do with Perl assuming that the lines has both a carriage return and a line feed on the lines and then chopping them off when the file was being sent via FTP. The fix that I ended up using was simply a one line regular expression like so (a suggestion from a co-worker):</p> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">$output=</code>some action<code class="highlighter-rouge">; $output=~ s/n/rn/g; print $output; print FOUT $output;</code></p> <p>Hope that this helps someone searching for an answer. I know that I would have liked to have happened upon the answer while searching for it.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/cost-and-benefits-of-running-your-own-server/"> Cost And Benefits Of Running Your Own Server </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 15</span> <p>There is a cost to running your own web server. I’m not talking about the actual monetary cost, although there definitely is some of that.</p> <p>I’m talking about the down time and lack of production-level reliability. I just got my Internet connection back up after being down nearly the entire day! I had checked the status in the morning, and it was working. However, when I got to work I couldn’t access it. “Oh great,” I thought.</p> <p>So basically I just lost a day of traffic, readership, etc. Great, that just stinks. You know I wonder what my uptime percentage is. I was thinking about it today as a result of not having it available, and I am positive that I am up more than 9 days out of 10. However, I’m pretty sure that I couldn’t claim more than 95%. Oh well.</p> <p>Anyways, I think that the benefits to running my own web server outweigh the cost. Let me share what I think some of them are.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Learn more about how the Internet works by becoming more than a user, become a cog.</p> </li> <li> <p>Know <em>exactly</em> where all of your data is stored</p> </li> <li> <p>Don’t have to pay for hosting costs (okay, okay there is the electricity to run the computer which is definitely something. But you’re not getting charged 15 bucks a month like you normally would be.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn interesting server-related things such as configuring Apache. This is especially interesting for those who have a professional interest in computers I think.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Is it worth it to you? I don’t even know what the percentages are of people who run their own server. I actually don’t know too many people that do. Of course I guess that speaks more about the people that I know than what is actually going on. In any case, sorry for the downtime, and I’m back (for now).</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/music-piracy-makes-people-stupid/"> Music Piracy Makes People Stupid </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 14</span> <p>In an article at Yahoo! about <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/43610153">cracking down on college music pirates</a>, I read about one Sarah Barg, a sophomore from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It portrayed her as a girl who was just taking part in what everyone else was doing. The article wanted to put her in the role of one who is definitely not the worst (I mean she <em>only</em> downloaded 381 songs when others were downloading thousands!). In response to it all, Barg says</p> <blockquote> <p>Obviously I knew it was illegal, but no one got in trouble for it</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, I know that all higher education is not equal. And I know that maybe not all of them are as good as the <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>, but that does not allow for such ridiculous thoughts. I think that ignorance is not a good excuse for doing wrong. The onus is on you to do what’s right. However, I think that actually knowing that something is wrong and yet still doing it speaks of some darker black.</p> <p>In any case, I don’t think that it’s a matter of intelligence. I think it’s a sign of the times.</p> <p>Piracy does not just affect music as I wrote in <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/04/14/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/">Even Worse Than At First Glance</a>, <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/05/04/cheatin-chinese/">Cheain’ Chinese</a>, and (in regards to cheating in general) <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/">Cheaters 4 Life</a>. Wow I did not realize that I had so many entries devoted to ranting about cheaters! But I digress.</p> <p>Reasons why you shouldn’t be a (music) pirate:</p> <ol> <li>You can afford the music (or whatever it is that you’re pirating).</li> </ol> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>* If you can't afford it, you don't need it.


* If you really can't afford it, you have things that you should be doing other than listening to music anyways.
</code></pre> </div> <ol> <li> <p>You can support and encourage the artists that you like to keep making music. It’s kind of like writing a blog and getting encouraged by people leaving comments. Except for them it’s people giving them money. I’m applying my energy to the wrong thing. :P</p> </li> <li> <p>You know it’s morally wrong.</p> </li> <li> <p>It’s actually against the law.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Now I admit that I’m not perfect, but I would like to think that once I knew the truth then I would change my behavior to match what I know. Not everyone is like this. But they should be. It just makes sense to have your behavior in line with your opinions, does it not? Don’t be the person who gets laughed at for coming off as stupid. Nobody wants 15 minutes of infamy.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/renege/"> Renege </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 14</span> <p>[ri-<strong>nig</strong>, -<strong>neg</strong>, -<strong>neeg</strong>]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>To break a rule, go back on one’s word, cheat (especially at cards)</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>When you play hearts, you need to follow suit if you have the suit that is first played.
