Nevertheless, when I happened upon a piece of software called <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/featured-download/allocate-your-money-in-envelopes-with-budget-262014.php">Budget</a> while I was reading through my feed reader this morning, I had to take a second look. Why? Well because I wrote (and am in current development of) <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-programming/the-budgeteer/">The Budgeteer</a>!</p> <p>There were notable differences, obviously. Comparing the two programs, here is what I noticed:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Budget deposits absolute amounts into each sub-account (represented as envelopes) whereas the Budgeteer deposits percentages into each sub-account. I recently thought about this difference actually. It would be nice to have options to do both/either. My original approach of percentages allows for things such as taking 10% off the top for tithe, but it has pitfalls such as having to specify a percentage for each sub-account. Granted of course you can play around with them over time such that they will approach what you actually need/want/use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Budget is much prettier. Both their Windows and Mac executables look better than my Python GUI. Granted, I haven’t been trying to make it beautiful or anything. And it is essentially the same functionality (clicking on different buttons, etc). Nevertheless, that is a plus that Budget has.</p> </li> <li> <p>Obviously Budget is production software that is being sold whereas the Budgeteer is something that I wrote up in a week and have since played with only a little bit. Budget also costs 30 bucks, and (when the time comes) the Budgeteer will not.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Budgeteer has a cooler name.</p> </li> </ol> <p>All in all, I would like to think that Budget and the Budgeteer are similar. However, I must concede that they are not even close to similar. Budget is much more polished, and I am now more determined to develop the Budgeteer!</p> <p>I’ve changed the name of the program to Budgeteer. I don’t know why I need so many e’s.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/culpable/"> Culpable </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 21</span> <p>[<strong>kuhl</strong>-p_uh_-b_uh_ l]</p> <h4 id="definition">Definition:</h4> <p>Rightfully deserving of blame or penalty</p> <h4 id="example-of-usage">Example of usage:</h4> <p>Planning and scheming for those many weeks was harmless fun, but once the thieves stepped onto the property of the bank that fateful night, they were culpable for their crimes.</p> <h4 id="comments">Comments:</h4> <p>This is a fairly oft-encountered word I think.

Find out both how weak the writing skills of young people can be as well as how strange you must have been to have thought it personally normal to interact with people in this way.</p> <p>Watch videos of yourself as a kid that show that you had the makings of who you are even back then. Even if that means that you were one who found humor in bullying others.</p> <p>Flip through some pictures that will make you laugh and some that will make you grimace.</p> <p>It’s amusing to look back, wouldn’t you say? Even though junk is not something that I’d prefer to keep around in general, you also have to know what to save. A box full of memories is something that everyone would do well to keep. Just think about how it can be used for instant fun when you can’t think of anything else. Or like when you can’t think of anything to blog about.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/excursions-into-the-casgo/"> Excursions Into The Casgo </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 19</span> <p>Enter the majestic gates. Or rather, the opening beneath the rolling warehouse door. Let them greet you as you flash your pass. Could you want anything more?</p> <p>Try out the little goodies all around. Different tastes offer themselves to you. The sweet and the salty, the bread and meat. All mixed in your stomach like some strange stew.</p> <p>What will you do when the crowd confronts you? You seem overwhelmed and help from who? Nobody cares about you and your posse. Oh look the pirate child to the rescue!</p> <p>He has a sword on his little belt. And a fearsome glow within his eyes. His hand is at the ready, But possibly if his Popsicle is taken he cries.</p> <p>The cheese! The cheese! Oh so much cheese! You want to eat more? Well then just say please.</p> <p>Bring your riches, then you may pass. I see the light, oh yonder ho! There is just one standing in our way. She then says, “thank you for coming to Casgo.”</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/macs-have-emacs-key-bindings/"> Macs Have Emacs Key Bindings? </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">May 18</span> <p>As a relatively new user of Macs, I was amazed to find that I could use some Emacs key bindings by default in Mac OS X. I’m sure that many people out there already know about this, but I thought it significant enough to write about it. Key bindings are basically combinations of keys that will perform some action because it is associated with it. For example, Ctrl+S is generally regarded as being used to save something, Ctrl+P is used to print, etc.</p> <p>Anyways, for those of you using Mac OS X and who don’t know much about Emacs I wanted to give a short run down. Emacs is basically an extensible text editor with the ability to have user-defined functions. There are key bindings that have a specified meaning when you’re using Emacs. Some useful ones that you might consider trying out are:</p> <p>Ctrl+f - Move 1 character forward Ctrl+b - Move 1 character backward Ctrl+d - Delete character in front of the curser Ctrl+a - Move to beginning of line Ctrl+e - Move to end of line</p> <p>There are many more key bindings available to Emacs that seem like they will usually get overridden by the program. Remember, this hint is for Mac OS X users. The most useful place that I could use these key bindings was in text fields in Firefox.</p> <p>Try it out and let me know. Don’t blame me, though, if you hit the wrong button or if the key binding is overridden to be something else in the program that you try it with!</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page60">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page58">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
