It’s there, you just have to know how to handle it. Here are some that I thought especially amusing.</p> <p><strong>The Library</strong> So I’m reading <em>Main Street</em> by Sinclair Lewis (as you can read about <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/currently-reading/main-street/">here</a>) but I’m only halfway done. Additionally I have already renewed it the maximum number of times. So I go to the <a href="http://www2.anaheim.net/article.cfm?id=118">library</a> and find the other copy to check out. Just before I get to the line to check it out, this lady comes in with her son and a BOX of books to donate or something. Additionally the other librarian is occupied with someone who has a whole bunch of questions. Thus I ended up waiting along with this other lady. We also happened to be right next to their new self-checkout machine. The lady and I discussed that we should try it. So I did. I put my library card down to scan, and then I tried to scan the book. But I used the wrong bar code. In this time an old asian guy cut in front of us and took the librarian just as she was free from the question lady. I was tempted to say something but I had pity on him because he was old. Plus we were really looking at the machine so I guess it’s slightly valid. But only slightly. Anyways, I forgot that the library has their own bar code inside the front cover rather than the general bar code on the back. When I realized this, I tried again and it worked! Happily I walked out and set off the alarm. As soon as I heard it I burst into laughter. Now anyone who has heard me laugh knows that it is slightly unbecoming a person in a public library. Haha apparently I forgot to push the spine against the edge in my self-checkout process. Suffice to say I thought it was funny, but the people reading quietly might not have.</p> <p><strong>Lost</strong> I’m sure many people watched <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index">Lost</a> last night. And there are probably loads of posts about what happened and how exciting or dull or horrible it was. But I would venture to say that none of those blog posts are the same as this one. As I was watching the episode, I saw something that triggered my memory. That beach that Sawyer and Kate were on at the end when leaving the island…<strong>I was on that beach!</strong> Now you will probably want to know why or how I know this. Well this past summer I went to Hawaii for a couple of weeks with some friends. One of my friends has a place out there because he’s going to school there so he knows of all of these local spots. One day we went to this random beach where nobody was. There might have also been a sign somewhere that said to stay off, but I can’t exactly remember. Haha anyways it was fun and the beach was very picturesque. It was in this little cove/bay with a big house on one side. We snorkeled and looked at coral and stuff. It was quite nice. As we were leaving we also heard some people on horseback walking by and talking about how Lost was filmed there. I thought that was cool but thought nothing more of it until last night. I saw that beach and I am fairly certain that was the beach that we were at. Haha I thought that was awesome and hilarious. Well the hilarious part was telling my sister about it and her being incredulous that I <em>might</em> not have supposed to have even been there. :D</p> <p>Amusing stuff, my life. Anyone’s can be, you just need to know where to look.</p> </div> <section> <h1>Comments</h1> <div id="disqus_thread" aria-live="polite"><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div> </section> <div class="related"> <h2>Related Posts</h2> <ul class="related-posts"> <li> <h3> <a href="/obi100-cannot-receive-google-voice-calls/"> OBi100 Cannot Receive Google Voice Calls <small>Jan 27</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/mysterious-seeds-or-bugs-around-house/"> Mysterious Seeds Or Bugs Around House <small>Jan 17</small> </a> </h3> </li> <li> <h3> <a href="/monetary-gifts/"> Monetary Gifts <small>Jun 24</small> </a> </h3> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/embed.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
