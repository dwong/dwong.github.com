It was generally fun, but the plane ride, oh the plane ride!</p> <p>Going there wasn’t fun because she just wanted her mother the whole time. Coming back was even worse because we tried to get her to sleep when the cabin lights dimmed, and she didn’t like that. Actually she probably hated it. Screaming and wailing soon followed.</p> <p>Nothing worked! We tried feeding her (magical) <a href="http://amzn.to/1Vk21oX">puffs</a>, singing, shushing, talking, and <a href="http://amzn.to/1Vk25Fg">ergo</a>-ing. All we got in return was an assault on our ears and our chests (from baby fists). She was tired, but the only way that she ended up falling asleep was if I walked around and did NOT talk to her. It seemed that talking to her made her fussy again. I imagine that she proteseted because she knew that we were trying to get her to sleep. Her nap was a brief respite. She was only really comfortable sleeping when it was NOT sleep time (i.e., lights were turned on and people moving about).</p> <p><img src="http://img.gtww.net.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/04_Japan/e3ir/sleep_dfji12.jpg" alt="Sleeping Bear" title="The Bear CAN sleep"/></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/sickness-strikes-again/"> Sickness Strikes Again </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 19</span> <p>I have now been taken out by the Bear and her sicknesses twice within a span of 3 weeks. Considering I always thought of myself as a healthy and robust person, it’s no joke when they say that you should avoid having kids if you don’t want to get sick! It just goes to show you that none of us are really that strong. We’re really rather feeble and weak (despite our best intentions).</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/the-sickness-is-strong-in-this-one/"> The Sickness Is Strong In This One </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jan 29</span> <p>The Bear got sick this past week. It was bound to happen eventually, right? The illness came with a few bouts of vomit along with some rather unpleasant less-than-sleepful nights. All is as expected. Except that I was also infected with said illness!</p> <p>So I’m not saying that I don’t ever get sick. Because I do. I definitely do. In fact when I do get sick it seems like it’s extra awful. But it still catches me by surprise that I can get sick so easily by such a little baby. Conceptually I know that germs are much tinier than either of us, and size does not matter at all when getting sick. But something about it still surprises me.</p> <p>Thankfully it only took me out for a day. But boy was it an unpleasant day!</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/colorado-2015/"> Colorado 2015 </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jan 21</span> <div class="galleria"> <a href="http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/denver_co_springs-1_b343371.jpg"><img data-title="" data-description="" src="http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/Thumbs/denver_co_springs-1_f568.jpg" height="40" width="33"/></a> <a href="http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/denver_co_springs-2_3f90224.jpg"><img data-title="" data-description="" src="http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/Thumbs/denver_co_springs-2_eb94.jpg" height="40" width="60"/></a> <a href="http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/denver_co_springs-3_6445d04.jpg"><img data-title="" data-description="" src="http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/Thumbs/denver_co_springs-3_8ceb.jpg" height="40" width="60"/></a> <a href="http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/denver_co_springs-5_a19f7dc.jpg"><img data-title="" data-description="" src="http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/Thumbs/denver_co_springs-5_baef.jpg" height="40" width="34"/></a> <a href="http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/denver_co_springs-8_35f9894.jpg"><img data-title="" data-description="" src="http://img.gtww.net/2015/11_Colorado/db3d/Thumbs/denver_co_springs-8_0fa8.jpg" height="40" width="60"/></a> </div> <p>It was our first time flying with a child, and it didn’t go too badly!

Just FYI.</p> <p>As I was changing the Bear’s diaper, she grabbed the changing pad (as she is wont to do). There was already some poop in the old diaper that I was changing so I moved that away before she could touch it. However, while I had her butt in the air (off of the changing table) she proceeded to poop some more. This new poop was fresh stuff (unlike the poop in the diaper which was more pebble-like). I was in a bind because one hand was holding up her legs, but the poop was going to land on the changing table. In order to save the poop from landing on the changing table, I had to just go for it. I decided that catching it with my hand was better than letting it fall.</p> <p>And thus I achieved another parenting milestone: I willingly chose to catch poop with my bare hand (thankfully not watery in any way).</p> <p>Ah parenthood, gotta love it.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page2">Older</a> <span class="pagination-item newer">Newer</span> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.imagesloaded/3.0.4/jquery.imagesloaded.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/1.3.1/jquery.wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});jQuery(document).ready(function(){var a=jQuery("#wookmark");if(a.length){var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});jQuery("#tiles").imagesLoaded(function(){b.wookmark({autoResize:true,container:a,offset:4,itemWidth:200});a.fadeIn();});}});</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("http://www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="http://c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
