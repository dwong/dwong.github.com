Have we forgotten this? Whatever happened to letting states decide things for themselves? Or even more, giving the rights to the people (without having it become a law).</p> <p>On the cusp of the likely signing into law of the Economic Stimulus Plan by President Obama, I can’t help but wonder how we got to this place. This place is one where the federal government gets to control so much of such a wide variety of areas. Will spending more of (essentially) our money revive us? I have my doubts as that has been tried before by FDR’s administration.</p> <p>This whole administration change has been interesting while I’m reading <a href="http://amzn.to/PuUYqb">Atlas Shrugged</a> by Ayn Rand, who would likely say that what President Obama stands for some of the most ultimate in evil because he is taking from the competent and giving to the incompetent.*</p> <p>Check out the <a href="http://www.tenthamendmentcenter.com/">10th Amendment Center</a>.</p> <p>What can we do? Perhaps decentralize the government a bit, huh? Not only is the government fairly unable to spend all of that money in a wise way, but they (at least in my mind) are going against the founding documents that this country is based on. Pragmatists will argue that desperate times call for desperate measures, but ideals are not just nebulous vapor. They are the foundation. Don’t let the foundation rot just so that the roof has new shingles. You can imagine the effect or even perhaps read about it <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%207:24-27;&amp;version=49;">here</a>.</p> <p><sub>* - Amusingly, I say this as if I know Rand even though I’m only halfway through the novel. So if you know contrary please let me know but don’t spoil the novel for me!</sub></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/marathon/"> Marathon </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Feb 3</span> <p>So I finished the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/15/half-marathon/">half marathon</a> back in October. And at the time I said that I wanted to eventually build up and do a full marathon.</p> <p>Well I started to train for the <a href="http://www.lamarathon.com/">Los Angeles Marathon</a>! I haven’t registered for it yet just in case something happens during my training until the price increase. (Amusingly it increases on April 1, 2009 since fools and marathons go hand in hand.)</p> <p>Many out there (myself included sometimes) wonder why people do these types of things. For me, it’s just something that I think would be an excellent chance to do. I’m not getting any younger. It’s a physical challenge that is a great goal to use to stay in shape. And it could be full of all types of life lessons. In the Bible there are <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:6-8;&amp;version=49;">all</a> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:28-31;&amp;version=49;">kinds</a> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012:1-2;&amp;version=49;">of</a> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:24-26;&amp;version=49;">references</a> to it, and I think that is because there is so much that we can learn from doing things like this. How will I truly understand illustrations that I have not participated in myself? Because as we all know, <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/01/experience-matters/">experience matters</a>!</p> <p>What will I learn? Will I finish? How long will I take? Stay tuned for all of this and much much more! Perhaps I will blog more about training for the marathon than I did while I was training for the half marathon. Perhaps.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/right-then-fast/"> Right Then Fast </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jan 28</span> <p>Wanting to do something new is an excellent thing. It’s often worthy of admiration whether that means keeping a commitment or trying something new.</p> <p>As the new year has rolled around, there have inevitably been a slew of new resolutions that people have made. They want to be healthier, they want to be slimmer, they want to be more productive. Whatever the case is, they are trying to be better than their old selves.</p> <p>It’s made me think recently about two of the things that I do: programming working out (well a little anyways).</p> <p>The thing that they have in common is that they need to be done right. What is right in a world of relative truths? Well, Reader, that is a good question. Right is correctness. It is the lack of error. It is proper form, and it is successful execution. It is, in fact, an absolute.</p> <p>As people are trying to exercise and get healthy, they’re trying to do it as quickly as possible. And often people will burn themselves out with all of the effort that they’re putting in. Combined with a poor view (e.g., the goal is not to be skinny, it is to be healthy) and inadequate preparation, this is a recipe for disaster. By the time that February rolls around, most of the new year’s resolutions have fallen by the wayside.</p> <p>There’s no use in trying to do 50 pushups as fast as you can if your form is incorrect. And there’s no use in trying to optimize a portion of code when the entire thing doesn’t work to begin with. Get back to the basics.</p> <p>First do it right, then do it fast.</p> <p><sub>[<a href="http://www.gymjones.com/knowledge.php?id=20">Quality, Quantity Or A Fast Time On The Stopwatch</a> - from the gym that brought you the cast of <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416449/">300</a></em>]</sub> <sub>[<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vpTAq4dnmuAC&amp;pg=PA474&amp;lpg=PA474">Optimization</a> from a book that I use (<em><a href="http://amzn.to/QOeOtF">Python in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition (In a Nutshell (O’Reilly))</a></em>)]</sub></p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/be-realistic/"> Be Realistic </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Jan 21</span> <p>He isn’t all that, people.</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span class="k">while</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">date</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="s">'2013-01-20'</span><span class="p">)</span>

And even more than that, not everyone watches the commercials. But recently there has been a commercial that contains the quote:</p> <blockquote> <p>I finish things. That’s what I do.</p> </blockquote> <p>-Clint Eastwood (from the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1205489/">Gran Torino</a>)</p> <p>While I initially started this post last week, I unfortunately didn’t finish it before Gran Torino actually released nation wide on 1/12/09. (How apropos!) The quote is still interesting, and Clint Eastwood is still going strong as he nears the cusp of 80 years.</p> <p>I see it all of the time: a carton of milk with a little bit left, a football player getting his arms on a runner but unsuccessfully bringing him down, books on reading lists that never get crossed off, leftover food that eventually rots, a job abandoned before its time. All of these things are a task unfinished.</p> <p>Everyday we perform tasks, and everyday we make choices. The finish line was made not only to be reached for, it was made to be crossed. Do I sprint, walk, or limp at the end? Or worse yet, do I not even get to see the end?</p> <p>Not that I’m there, but oh that I would live so that when I look back I can see that I made choices for completion in the form of empty plates, finished projects, read books, and tackled runners. Especially tackled runners.</p> </div> </div> <div class="pagination"> <a class="pagination-item older" href="/page29">Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/page27">Newer</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <label for="sidebar-checkbox" class="sidebar-toggle"></label> <script>(function(b){var a=b.querySelector(".sidebar-toggle");var d=b.querySelector("#sidebar");var c=b.querySelector("#sidebar-checkbox");b.addEventListener("click",function(g){var f=g.target;if(!c.checked||d.contains(f)||(f===c||f===a)){return;}c.checked=false;},false);})(document);</script> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/galleria.min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.colorbox/1.4.33/jquery.colorbox-min.js"></script> <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery.wookmark/2.1.1/wookmark.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">jQuery(document).ready(function(){if(jQuery(".galleria")[0]){jQuery(".galleria,.galleria_container").css("height",600);Galleria.loadTheme("//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleria/1.3.5/themes/classic/galleria.classic.min.js");Galleria.run(".galleria",{lightbox:true,showInfo:true});}});(function(){var a=document.getElementById("wookmark");if(a!=null){var c=new Wookmark("#tiles");var b=jQuery("#tiles li");jQuery("a",b).addClass("gal").colorbox({rel:"gal",maxWidth:"80%",maxHeight:"90%"});}})();</script> <script src="//goingthewongway.disqus.com/count.js" async></script> <script>a("//www.statcounter.com/counter/counter.js");</script><noscript><div class="statcounter"><img class="statcounter" src="//c.statcounter.com/2375202/0/1b55b1d6/1/" alt="hit"/></div></noscript> </body> </html>
