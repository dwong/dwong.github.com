  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nobody wants to be a copy.  But there has to be copies.</p>

<p>Logically, there can only be a single person who is first.  Buzz Aldrin wasn&rsquo;t it.  Neither was John Adams.  While that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they were any less impressive, it does mean that they didn&rsquo;t get to be the first in their respective areas.</p>

<p>But many people are not satisfied to simply be doing something that has already been done.  They want to be first.  So they make claims that mean nothing.  They state that they&rsquo;ve invented the wheel without realizing that history says differently.  They&rsquo;re either <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/08/06/ignorance-bliss/">blissfully ignorant</a> or possibly a little more nefarious than that.</p>

<p>This strikes deeper than simply attaining to some unknown peak.  While for some people it might just be reaching for great things, it seems like those that make claims of &ldquo;revolutionizing&rdquo; something are just stuck in a world without the wild west to explore.  They&rsquo;re inventing frontiers where there is already a well-worn road.  And they&rsquo;re doing it because they can&rsquo;t stand the thought of not doing something worthwhile in their lifetime.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to be a standout somehow.  And you can.  You don&rsquo;t need to falsify your achievements to do it.  In fact, perhaps it&rsquo;ll come even quicker if you stop looking so hard for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Can I just say after watching the music videos for Usher&rsquo;s songs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqqY07OZWps">Love In This Club</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64EjuSEXsYg">Moving Mountains</a> that I think that he is like R. Kelly (aka certifiably crazy)?  Please, does anyone remember R. Kelly&rsquo;s Trapped In The Closet series?</p>

<p>On the one hand, I&rsquo;m laughing hysterically.  But on the other this is just out of hand.</p>

<p>Edit: Must be because of their collaboration on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlqdxZcgnZg">Same Girl</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are a couple of types of people in the world.  There are some that want to make sure that all is well before they proceed and then there are those that will just do things without thinking about the consequences.</p>

<p>There is a related idea in computer programming.  You can check all of the variables, program state, and other circumstances.  When everything is kosher, you go for it.  And hopefully you are successful.  The problem with this, though, is that you might forget to check something.  Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t accounted for everything as you should have.  Then what?  Then disaster!  (Or something like that.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is another idea that can be used.  It is the idea (at least in <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>) that it is <strong>E</strong>asier to <strong>A</strong>sk for <strong>F</strong>orgiveness than <strong>P</strong>ermission (i.e., EAFP).  This way of dealing with errors is to go for the gusto and then deal with problems as they arise.</p>

<p>I need a little more EAFP.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was at UCSD for my undergraduate program in Computer Science, I had a professor who told a story about working on a project.  For the project, he was creating a new software system (the purpose of which I have since forgotten).  He told how he was fairly quick in the design and starting of the program.  There was steady progress until he was about 80% done.</p>

<p>He continued to work on it (because as you well know 80% is getting pretty close to 100%).  However, with new changes, he kept discovering that more work needed to be done.  He would have to go back over his code to change things that he thought that he had previously addressed.  The thing was, the further along he got, the more he discovered that he wasn&rsquo;t nearly as close as he thought.  So while he got further along, the end remained elusively close and yet not quite close enough.</p>

<p>While he was talking about the difficulties of the complete software development process, I also feel like the same troubles can affect me.  (Haha and sometimes it happens to me in the software development process.)  I make strides when there is much to be done.  But then things start getting down near the end.  I can see the end.  Or at least I think that I can.  But things keep popping up that keep me from getting there.  Things will get done, but for some reason it feels like I&rsquo;m going nowhere fast.</p>

<p>From experience I&rsquo;ve realized that I have to keep churning away at it until I&rsquo;ve gotten there.  When you&rsquo;re climbing the hill, the end has to be the toughest (I mean, you&rsquo;ve already spent all of that energy getting to where you&rsquo;re at).  But that triumphant moment when you get there, that&rsquo;s worth it.  Or, at least it usually is.</p>

<p><em>(Notice: Don&rsquo;t climb mountains that you&rsquo;re physically incapable of completing.  I am just making my small commentary on life.  I am in no way, shape, or form responsible if you actually fall off the side of a mountain.)</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Does anyone else wish that people thought about others more?  I can&rsquo;t stand it when people think that their actions have no consequences for other people!</p>

<p>Sometimes people will do horrible and disgusting things.  Sometimes they&rsquo;ll even admit that it&rsquo;s wrong.  Sometimes, though, it goes beyond reason when they do horrible things, and justify themselves to others with the opinion that it won&rsquo;t affect other people.</p>

<p>Spit out your gum?  Yeah, it&rsquo;ll get on people&rsquo;s shoes (or even my car!).  That is not a happy moment.</p>

<p>Throw your trash onto the street?  Someone has to pick it up, and it most likely is not going to be your mother.  It&rsquo;s going to be some poor soul who has to clean up your mess.</p>

<p>These things?  These are the least of the offenses.  The world is full of them.</p>
