  <div class="entry-content"><p>Farmers have used branding for a long time as a way to mark their property, namely their livestock.  They knew that if their livestock wandered off (as they invariably would) then they needed a way to make sure that they had a way to get their property back.  It was a wonderful idea for the farmers.  But what did the livestock think?  I am sure that the livestock were not huge fans of the process.  Having a hot metal brand pressed into their skin was probably not on their list of highlights from their lives.  But they didn&rsquo;t have a choice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/179/applegeeks-coachgirls/">Apple stickers</a> on cars, Gucci emblems on purses (<a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/70/even-worse-than-at-first-glance/">real or fake</a>), and perhaps even soccer jerseys with their large corporate sponsorship logos are all things that seem to follow this idea.  It&rsquo;s a strange idea really because we are paying companies so that we can advertise for them.  If I walked up to you and asked if you would pay me money in order to wear a necklace with my name on it you would think that I am crazy.  Is the idea that we would pay to display companies&#8217; logos that far off from this example?</p>

<p>Nowadays people have a choice.  And I am always surprised when people  choose self-branding.  Instead of viewing it as branding, though, they want to display an affiliation, love the cachet/exclusivity, or perhaps just do it because  others do it also.</p>

<p>In truth, we all do it to some degree.  We buy T-shirts, computers, and cars that all have logos on them.  So I would doubt very much if anyone is exempt.  But thinking about it sure does make one think.  And it sure does give me a different perspective of &ldquo;brand&rdquo; names.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you heard of outsourcing?  Besides the TV show, there is much to the issue of outsourcing.  At the heart of it, outsourcing basically means getting someone else to do the work.  When used in terms of software, it usually refers to having someone overseas in India or China write the code according to what the desired behavior is.  For the past decade or so there has been talk (and more than talk) about how all of the software created is going to be outsourced rather than done in America.  In fact I remember during my undergraduate studies there was a survey taken of my class to find out whether talk of the outsourcing of our future careers scared us into going into other fields.  At the time it did not seem too pressing of an issue.  Maybe it is because we were not aware enough of what was really going on in the industry yet.  In any case, the reason that all of the outsourcing was talked about is basically because  American computer programmers are much more expensive than those in other countries.</p>

<p>So what does this mean to me (or you) unless you are getting laid off as your work is being moved overseas?  I think it still is quite relevant.  Because it is not just losing a job that causes me to stop.  It is really the fact that I have seen people purposely choose to outsource their own projects!   In their new ventures they have opted to outsource the programming to some other group or country.  As for me, though, I do not think that I would ever outsource my projects.</p>

<p>Reasons why I would not outsource my projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I set out on a side project because <strong>I want to learn</strong> something.  Maybe I want to learn a new programming language.  Maybe I just want to go through the experience of building something in particular.  After all, <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/366/experience-matters/">experience matters</a>.  And I want that experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Outsourcing something essentially <strong>tramples upon the lower state of others</strong>.  While I am sure that I do this in an indirect way (e.g., by buying anything made in China), it still seems worse to me to directly order other people to do things.</p></li>
<li><p>When I do something myself, I get this odd <strong>satisfaction from doing something myself</strong>.  I do not imagine that everyone else feels the same way.  In fact I would guess that most other people just want whatever it is to work.  But I love being able to look at something (even if it is imperfect) and knowing that I had a huge hand in doing it.</p></li>
<li><p>There seem to be a myriad of reasons why working with people in another country (or even other people in general) would be difficult.  This includes things like <strong>language, time difference, and general misunderstandings</strong>.  As the sayings goes: &ldquo;If you want something done right you have got to do it yourself.&#8221;  Because trusting others to do things that you want to do is not ever going to work out just as you have planned.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>While people can (obviously) do whatever they want with their projects, I am pretty sure that I would not do such a thing.  In fact it flies in the face of who I want to be.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What up guy at the soda fountain using your definitively clear plastic water cup in order to get some soda?   How are your ill-gotten gains?   Tasty I hope.</p>

<p>I am sure that you have a good reason for doing what you do.  The world has probably beaten and berated you.  You deserve some of this sweet nectar.  Besides, you figure that it is a chain restaurant, and the syrup water that you are taking is really only worth cents to them.  If you have a job it probably is not the one that you really want (I mean not everyone gets to sleep in, tell people what to do, and have no pressure on them whatsoever).  Or maybe you don&rsquo;t get paid as much as you know that you deserve (it must be because people don&rsquo;t understand how much you are worth).</p>

<p>Some people will never learn to have integrity <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/6/cheaters-4-life/">no matter what they are doing</a>.  Some people will sell it for a little cup of soda.  Then again <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2025:29-34&amp;version=NASB">others have sold much more valuable things for not much more in return</a>.</p>

<p>So keep at it, sir.  I know that you will no matter what I say.  And good luck on that whole job of your dreams thing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The post title pretty much says it.  Crom, our (or at least my) favorite interesting co-worker, has a girlfriend.  While this may be new to you, it is not actually new information.  As far as I can gather they are in a long term relationship.  So that would probably make it pretty old information since my co-workers tell me that she&rsquo;s been in his life for awhile, and he has been here for 10 years.</p>

<p>So I wonder, what is it about commitment that scares people?  He is probably in his mid to late 40&rsquo;s, and from the sound of it has never been married while he has worked here.  I have heard him joke about getting married to his girlfriend.  Of course I would imagine that those jokes have happened many times over the years with no obvious change in the situation.  Maybe he&rsquo;s just testing things out like <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/825/crom-the-one-without-license-plates/">he&rsquo;s testing out his &ldquo;new&rdquo; car</a>.</p>

<p>I wonder if he writes a blog, and he wonders about me being a young (relatively to him) guy who has already gotten suckered into getting married.  Let&rsquo;s hope so!</p>

<p>The funniest part is that I could never forget her name.  Previously he gave some of us login information for one of his machines so that we could work on a project.  Her name was the password.  Even though I have long since worked on that project, I definitely keep that Post-It note around just for kicks.</p>
