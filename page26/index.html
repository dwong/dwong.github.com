Some lessons that I have been learning:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You are very likely under the impression that cotton is a glorious and soft fabric. But let me tell you that 15 miles can dictate otherwise. <strong>Chaffing is real, people. And it’s dangerous.</strong> It is just crazy how such a small discomfort can completely occupy your mind. It is a nice reminder to get yourself set up completely before setting out. So beware for certain parts of your body. Personally it happens with my crotch and nipples. Is that too much information? Haha TOO BAD! :D</p> </li> <li> <p>Seriously? <strong>Cracks in the sidewalk</strong>? In fact yes. I thought it ludicrous to even consider them. How hard is it to just watch where you’re running? If there’s a crack, don’t trip on it. It’s obvious, it’s simple. And I failed. Yes, that is correct. I was running a while ago, and I was paying attention to the jacket that I was holding in my hand. Next thing I knew, I was stumbling and nearly on my face. Thanks to the amazing reflexes that God placed in me, I was able to remain upright. Really, I couldn’t believe that I didn’t eat some cement right there. A passing truck saw and slowed down, but continued on their way once they saw that I had not even fallen down. I counted my lucky stars and was thankful (once again) for reflexes that are faster than I can say, “Oh no!”</p> </li> <li> <p>Running along major streets leads to some interesting scenarios. People driving by can be placed into a few categories:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Haters</strong> - They will try their very hardest to scare me with honks and shouts. Usually they’re in high school, and they have so little in their life to be excited about that the best thing to happen to them would be to see others suffer. Pretty much they’re retarded.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Encouragers</strong> - When passing they either honk in a more friendly way or yell out encouragement. I appreciate that, and I think that’s right kind of them.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Leerers</strong> - This probably happens much more to girls, but there are definitely those that will make comments that are somewhat lascivious. As a guy, I actually think that it’s awesome to get that. Haha don’t judge me. A girl yelled, “Sexy!” when I was running without a shirt a little while back. Why didn’t I have a shirt on? Because I can! Well that’s only partly true. It was also pretty hot and… see the point about chaffing.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> <p>If you so desire, you can see my <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=paQawpLdPpn-M47OHMSL-GA">LA Marathon 2009 training log</a> for yourself.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/needs-blemishes/"> Needs Blemishes </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Apr 10</span> <p>When something is too good everyone thinks that something is wrong. A little while back I made a T-shirt, and it surprisingly turned out decently. Considering that I am not very artistic, it was rather miraculous that the lines were straight and the overall presentation was just fine. However, the most interesting thing that I found was that people that saw it did not realize that I did it freehand. Since the lines were straight and everything looked good, there were some that just thought that I used a stencil while other people did not even realize that I had made the shirt!</p> <p>It is easy and natural for people to only believe something if they can see the flaw in it. Else they will think that something is amiss (e.g., a machine made the product and you are trying to pass it off as your own work). Most of the time this is spot-on. People are imperfect. Everyone knows this. Why else would we need Jesus? Still it’s rather amusing to note that while people can assume that perfection in other people is acceptable, perfection is a piece of handiwork is odd.</p> <p>Sing on it Nat King Cole (<em>Mona Lisa</em>).</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/marathon-training-and-then-some/"> Marathon Training And Then Some </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 31</span> <p>So lately when people have asked me what has been going on, it’s pretty much been work (which is obviously going to be every weekday) and training for the 2009 Los Angeles Marathon. I decided to <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2009/02/03/marathon/">sign up for it</a> a little while back, and now is as good of a time as any for a little update.</p> <p>While training for the <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2008/10/15/half-marathon/">half marathon</a> was a good introduction, it wasn’t nearly as intense. The thing about marathons is that they are known to be much more difficult to do without training. A half marathon (at 13.1 miles) is daunting, but it is still doable without too much training. But with 26.2 miles, there is the very real chance of “hitting the wall” (where the energy is depleted from the runner’s system leaving little left to continue on). And there are even some very well-publicized cases of people dying during a marathon. I want to train so that those things will not happen to me!</p> <p>I have definitely found out that something that you do not get right away is how much of a commitment this is. Training takes a large amount of time! I am on week 10 (out of 16 weeks) of my training, and I am running about 25-30 miles weekly. Holy moly! All of that training consists of an average of 45 minutes for the non-long runs and upwards of 3 hours (so far) for my long runs. I have a single long run each week that comprises less than half of my weekly mileage. And both my long runs and my weekly mileage will (and should) continue to increase. All told, I am spending a significant portion of my time on this.</p> <p>What have I learned from training thus far?</p> <ul> <li> <p>A commitment to exercise and health is life-changing. And not easy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perseverance and the power of the mind is key.</p> </li> <li> <p>Having a goal and training for it is an <strong>excellent</strong> way to lose weight. I was not even looking to do it, but it just happens!</p> </li> <li> <blockquote> <p>I don’t know if running adds years to your life, but it definitely adds life to your years. [<a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-244--12968-6-1X2X3X4X5-6,00.html">Runner’s World Article (Page 6)</a>]</p> </blockquote> </li> <li> <p>Running, amazingly enough, can be enjoyable. (It can also be torturous!)</p> </li> <li>It is definitely nice finding out that I am not dependent on my car. I can in fact go to the supermarket or the bank without it, if I so desire. This week I will also see what it feels like to commute from work to home using my running shoes.</li> </ul> <p>I am not nearly done yet. I will not be until I cross that glorious finish line. However I can say that I am registered. And that is either a cause for me to commend myself or ask what in the world have I gotten myself into.</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/middle-names/"> Middle Names </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 25</span> <p>We use names in order to identify people. Names are different according to our culture. Sometimes the family name is given more weight. Other cultures will have names that have a much stronger tie to what the person is like (e.g., Dashing Wind). And I am sure that there are many other uses for names that I don’t know about.</p> <p>Here in America people often have middle names. We especially like to use the middle initial in order to make our name more unique. But our middle name is usually kept to ourselves. Or perhaps it’s just left to those times when our parents are exceptionally angry with us. There’s nothing like having your full name yelled to let you know that it’s time to do something right.</p> <p>In any case I have found myself over the years enjoying learning what people’s middle names are. After thinking about why this might be so, I have realized that it’s probably because it usually <em>is</em> secret. I like knowing secrets. Doesn’t everyone? Middle names in particular make me feel that I am getting the chance to know people better because I have discovered something that so many other people don’t even take the time to find out. It creates an instant connection with them.</p> <p>To top it all off, middle names can often be unique. And that can lead to amusing situations, indeed.</p> <p>Middle names win. Sharing is caring. Ugh that’s so cliche, huh?</p> </div> <div class="post"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/go-go-stop/"> Go, Go, Stop! </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">Mar 20</span> <p>I often like to think about things that I take for granted. It makes me more appreciative of what I have, and I don’t think that’s a bad thing at all. A while back, I was thinking about how great the yellow light is. For me, more often than not it’s a sign that says, “figure out if you can make this light!” Sometimes this is a resounding yes, and sometimes it’s a resounding no. Sometimes it’s even “you better get going pronto!” Can you imagine, though, what it would be like without yellow lights? Drivers would be moseying along thinking that they’re good to go, when all of a sudden they need to slam on their brakes. Accidents would abound because brakes cannot stop you instantly.</p> <p>Recently, I even got to experience a similar kind of fun. Many of the lights along a street that I commute on were out. So as expected all of the cars treated each malfunctioning light as an all-way stop intersection. And that wrecked havoc on my commute. Boy am I glad for signals!</p> <p>Oddly enough, this reminded me of a problem that I am dealing with at work. The problem is that I am trying to make a single database access for every single object that I want to create. That would be analogous to a stop sign which lets everyone through one at a time. Ideally I am trying to code things that will allow for multiple objects with a single database connection. This would be with the lights that let multiple cars through.
