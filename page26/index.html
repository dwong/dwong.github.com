  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I think that now I&rsquo;m okay after upgrading my version of Wordpress (via <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>) to 2.7.  Let me say that the new Dashboard (the part that the site owner looks at) is pretty darn nice now.  You can drag and drop things, and it has all kinds of AJAX goodness.</p>

<p>But I also had some difficulties while upgrading.  Namely, I had to fiddle a bit to get everything working alright.  I&rsquo;d been using Brian&rsquo;s Threaded Comments, and the move from that to the new baked-in threaded comments wasn&rsquo;t too hard.  I just needed to update my theme, which is thankfully a custom one that I wrote so I know the ins and outs of it.  So I made a new comments page that looks fairly similar to what it looked like before.  The threading was maintained on old posts, and I definitely count it a success.</p>

<p>Then I realized today that my commenting isn&rsquo;t working!  While using Brian&rsquo;s Threaded Comments, I had been using a custom comment posting page to hinder spam.  However that meant that I wasn&rsquo;t using the normal page.  So when I switched to the normal page (wp-comment-post.php), it wasn&rsquo;t working!  I had to realize that the &ldquo;Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by &hellip;&rdquo; error was because I had some extra lines in the aforementioned comment posting page.  Removed those, and all is well.</p>

<p>So if you tried to comment recently and that didn&rsquo;t work for you, I apologize.</p>

<p>But now that I think that I&rsquo;m all good, I can enjoy how nice this new version is.  You won&rsquo;t be able to tell because it looks the same to you, but if you&rsquo;re thinking about blogging then consider <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress.com</a> (if you don&rsquo;t have a server) and <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress.org</a> (if you do have your own server).</p>

<p>If you have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about, then good day to you, and I hope that you&rsquo;re doing well.  Cheer up, at least gas is approaching $1.50 per gallon (it was $1.66 at Costco when I got it this morning).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you alter someone&rsquo;s mood and behavior so that they become a monster?  What&rsquo;s the secret to finding out what they&rsquo;re really like?</p>

<p>A box.  Yes, put them into a box.  Of course, most of us don&rsquo;t want to be put into a box because we feel that it inhibits who we are.  We don&rsquo;t want others to define us.  And that makes sense.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m talking about a metal box.  In fact it&rsquo;s a metal box that rolls around.  And when you put someone inside you get to see their rage, impatience, and overall self-centered nature.  It&rsquo;s like releasing The Incredible Hulk, without all of that gamma mess.  It really is pretty shocking.</p>

<p>When you use the box, you will get to see how people love to do things for themselves.  In particular, they like to cut in line.  Can you imagine if they did that to you while waiting in line at the bank?  Perhaps when the teller says, &ldquo;Next,&rdquo; they will jump the line and just go up.  What kind of an uproar would that cause?  I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;d meet with some fairly vocal outrage.  But in the metal box?  It all comes out.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/01/24/cheaters-4-life/">love</a> <a href="http://www.goingthewongway.com/2007/06/27/on-driving/">writing</a> about this.  That&rsquo;s what happens when you see it everyday!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When you&rsquo;re out and about, you might happen upon people that are moving to sound.  Yes yes, in life you might see dancing.  Whether in the club or at an organized school dance or at a wedding or in your house, dancing has a way of getting to people.  Some more than others.</p>

<p>Is it just me or does it always seem like people like to develop into circles when they&rsquo;re dancing in groups?  And where there is a circle, there will eventually be someone in the mush pot.  It also seems like there is a particular type of person that always ends up in the middle.  Maybe they like the attention.  Maybe they&rsquo;re trying to impress a special someone.  Or maybe they just love a little space while they&rsquo;re busting their moves.  Everyone who&rsquo;s not in the circle?  I think that they like the circles because they can be entertained without having to actually dance.</p>

<p>Me?  I say no to circles!  Fun for all!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Aren&rsquo;t bathrooms full of such interesting happenings?</p>

<p>In the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290002/">Meet the Fockers</a> as Bernie Focker is giving everyone a tour of their house, he eventually gets to the bathroom.  When he&rsquo;s there, he tells them the rule of the house is</p>

<blockquote><p>If it&rsquo;s yellow let it mellow, if it&rsquo;s brown flush it down.
-Bernie Focker</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that I&rsquo;m working with someone who has taken that to heart.</p>

<p>No, scratch that.  Some of them don&rsquo;t even flush it down.  Decency people, decency!</p>
